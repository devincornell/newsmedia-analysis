He was a well-respected World World II veteran and Purple Heart recipient. \n\nLaird had become a vocal critic of President Lyndon B. Johnson and his secretary of defense, Robert McNamara's policy on the Vietnam War. \n\nLaird had several goals as secretary of defense. He wanted to end the draft, disengage from the war and reach a peace settlement.\n\n\"Wars are easy to enter into,\" he said in 2010. \"They're very difficult to get out of.\"\n\nLaird pushed a policy of \"Vietnamization,\" which meant withdrawing US forces while equipping and training South Vietnam's military. \n\nHe also instituted sweeping changes in US foreign and defense policy, most importantly by shifting the US military from a conscripted army to an all-volunteer force. \n\nLaird said it was a matter of equity. \"It is pretty much an economic issue because conscript labor -- paying young men in the military very low rates -- was unfair.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was a difficult fight ... but I maintained and by the time I left the White House, there was no draft.\"\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Ash Carter praised Laird's contributions in a statement issued Wednesday.\n\n\"Secretary Laird led the Defense Department through a time of great change in the world and within our department. Through it all, he demonstrated an unfailing commitment to protecting our country, strengthening our military, and making a better world.\"\n\nLaird also publicly highlighted the inhumane treatment of American prisoners of war and pushed for their return.\n\n\"Those of us who fought and those of us held prisoner in Vietnam will always have a special place in our hearts for Sec Melvin Laird,\" tweeted Sen. John McCain. \n\nThose of us who fought & those of us held prisoner in #Vietnam will always have a special place in our hearts for Sec Melvin Laird. RIP.\u2014 John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) November 16, 2016\n\nLaird stepped down in 1973, serving four years in the administration as he had vowed to do.\n\nLegacy outside of Vietnam policy \n\nBorn in Omaha, Laird came from a family in which both parents had held political office. It seemed natural that he should enter politics. \n\nHe represented the Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District from 1953 to 1969.  \n\nLaird and Democrat Congressman John E. Fogarty, from Rhode Island, formed a bipartisan alliance to expand federal funding for medical research projects and institutions -- including the National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n\n\"It was a great start to what ultimately became the reward of the NIH to the nation and to the world, with its research resulting in better health care for people all over the world,\"  Laird said in a 2014 interview.\n\nThe Laird Center for Medical Research in Wisconsin is named after him as a tribute to his health advocacy. \n\n\"His work helped shape medical research as we know it,\" said Dr. Susan Turney CEO of the Marshfield Clinic Health System where the Laird Center is based. \n\nLaird had fondly looked back on his days working across the aisle with Fogarty. \n\n\"The two of us put aside our party affiliations and worked ... to prove how working together could build a national program for health research and education that would be the envy of the world,\" he said in a 2014 interview.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.337268114089966, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 550, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.67834906594, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161117100000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.18181818181818, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/opinions/trump-success-keep-campaign-promises-santorum/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Rick Santorum: President Trump will succeed if he keeps promises", "wordcount_as_scraped": 791, "date": "20170120190000", "story_content": "If President Trump wants to go big league, he needs to make an immediate impact with a bold agenda in the first 100 days. From Supreme Court nominations to immigration and trade promises, Mr. Trump needs to make his priorities stick.\n\nFirst, he must immediately nominate his candidate to replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Trump's presidency has the chance to save the Constitution from obliteration by a runaway Supreme Court, and there could be no greater accomplishment. His Supreme Court nominations likely will define his presidency.\n\nThere are critical cases before the Court in late April that, without a replacement being seated, will further erode of our liberty. Speed is of the essence because the press is already beginning to report which candidates he is meeting with.  If he wants his selection to get a fair hearing, the selection needs to be made in January, before Trump opponents can unfairly target the nominee for defeat.\n\nBeyond his long-term legacy on the Court, President Trump needs to immediately address the healthcare crisis that has been caused by Obamacare. Our nation's health insurance marketplace is collapsing upon itself; dramatically driving up premiums and out-of-pocket costs for hard-working Americans. Congress has already set in motion the repeal of Obamacare, but it will be up to President Trump to lead the replacement process. Consumers will need confidence that their care will be there if necessary. Obamacare was an unmitigated disaster, and it is up to President Trump and the Republican Congress to replace it with a patient-based plan that puts the power of the most important decisions any of us will make back into our hands.\n\n And as President Trump moves forward with his initial agenda, it will be essential that he uphold his promise to the American worker.  Voters from Pennsylvania to Michigan and Wisconsin bucked decade-long voting patterns to give his \"made in America\" platform a chance. Now he needs to deliver for those voters.\n\nThis means following through with his commitment to enforce our immigration and trade laws. Doing so would be a marketed shift from the Obama policies of turning a blind eye to the costs of cheap foreign labor on our blue-collar communities and from Republican traditions of unfettered free trade that places the bottom line over workers. Neither of these practices will require congressional approval; they will simply require the will of a president to uphold the pledges he made to voters willing to take a chance on a nontraditional candidate.\n\nThese same communities are also counting on President Trump to revive a manufacturing base that has been eroded over the past 40 years. But to accomplish this turnaround, these communities and their manufacturers will need low-cost energy resources at their disposal. Costly Obama-era regulations will need to be reversed, initiatives like the Keystone Pipeline must be completed, and programs like the Renewable Fuel Standard will need to be extended. President Trump can do much of these things on day one because it involves simply revoking executive orders. But other rules are more complicated and will take agency or congressional action, which Mr. Trump will need to be ready to kick-start.\n\nAnd finally, Mr. Trump needs to put more money in the pockets of workers along with a simplified tax code and tax reduction, especially in business taxes -- which are among the highest in the world. Tax simplification and reform has been a clarion call of both President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, and this will be central to revitalizing our economy for the American worker.\n\nWith these priorities on his domestic agenda, President Trump must also be committed to an international agenda, remembering that he will be Commander in Chief to the most powerful nation in the history of the world. In two key areas -- our relationship with the United Nations and the Iran nuclear deal -- he needs to shift our country's focus.\n\nIn response to the recent anti-Israel resolution by the UN Security Council, we must extricate ourselves from the UN's un-democratic sub-agencies. This will be a welcome sign to our allies, particularly Israel, which feels hung out to dry by President Obama. \n\nAnd we need to unravel the Obama Administration's nuclear deal with Iran. President Trump needs to make sure this radical Islamic regime never gets close to achieving the nuclear weapon the Obama Administration has failed to prevent it from developing. \n\nThis is an ambitious agenda. President Trump has a lot of work to do in order to dig our nation out of the hole President Obama dug for him. But if he plans to make good on his promise to make America great again, following through on these campaign promises from the very beginning of his administration will be step one.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.69767439365387, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 799, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.28903242037, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170120190000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.50312891113892, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/09/politics/government-shutdown/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 642, "scraper_regex": 1139}}, "headline": "Government stays open, funding bill clears key hurdle in Senate", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1139, "date": "20161209220000", "story_content": "The Senate late Friday cleared a bill to fund the government through the end of April, narrowly averting a shutdown.\n\nThe 63-36 vote came just before a midnight deadline when the government could have run out of money.  \n\nFinal passage came after a procedural vote to advance the measure was narrowly adopted. Needing 60 votes, it cleared 61-38. The vote took nearly an hour and was tense and uncertain to the end as senators weighed political and parochial interests in deciding which way to vote.  Party leaders and whips, trying to save the must-pass bill, worked their members furiously. President Barack Obama signed the measure into law early Saturday.\n\nThe late night action came after a day of back-channel negotiations aimed at alleviating concerns from coal-state Democrats who wanted a longer extension of expiring health benefits for retired coal miners. Democrats failed to secure enough votes to that extension. \n\nThe battle centered on how long the government should extend health benefits for retired coal miners, as the Democrats called for an extension lasting one year, rather than the four months in the current proposal. And it amounted to the most intense partisan squabble on Capitol Hill since the general election, where Democrats struggled to win over white, working-class voters.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who faces reelection in 2018 and is under consideration for a job in Donald Trump's administration, took to the Senate floor Friday evening and demanded that his colleagues block the funding bill, which is needed to keep the government open past midnight.\n\n\"We've been working and fighting and really clawing for this,\" Manchin said. \"But we've got some friends on the other side who believed it wasn't an emergency.\" Still, Democrats privately and publicly conceded they were unlikely to win over the 41 votes needed to shut the government down. \n\n\"I don't think we are going to get to the 41,\" Manchin said at a news conference Friday evening.\n\nWhat Democrats got from the exercise is unclear. Democrats contended they had elevated the issue, and hoped that their aggressive push would pressure top Republicans to cut a deal on a permanent solution early next year. But they did not get the legislative fix they had been demanding.\n\nDuring a caucus meeting Thursday, Senate Democratic leaders and coal-state Democrats agreed to use a threat of a shutdown to bring attention to the issue and push for a longer extension in January, a senior Democratic aide said.\n\n\"Our intention was never, never, ever to shut this place down,\" Manchin told CNN.\n\nAdded Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia: \"We're not going to shut down the government on this issue.\"\n\nThe late-evening developments come as Senate Republicans and Democrats engaged in behind the scenes negotiations to try to head off a shutdown at midnight.\n\n\"I'm hopeful we'll wrap it up this evening but I don't have anything to announce yet,\" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second ranking Senate Republican, told reporters.\n\nIn a sign of possible progress that a disruption to government services could be averted, Cornyn said discussions were underway between GOP leaders and Manchin of West Virginia, the lead Democrat pressing for changes to the health insurance program.\n\n\"We're working through third parties. Third party negotiators,\" Cornyn said. \"I haven't talked to him directly but there are conversations taking place between leadership on the Democratic side and this side.\"\n\nRepublicans argued McConnell, who represents miner interests in his home state of Kentucky, has already committed to work to extend the health insurance for a full year, which is the central demand of Manchin and the Democrats backing his effort. Republicans note that McConnell initially pushed to get a one year extension into the funding bill and has spoken on the floor about his desire to extend it that long. \n\nSen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, one of the leaders of the effort, told CNN that the GOP would squarely to be blame if there were a shutdown. Asked if he had the support to block a bill, Brown said: \"I don't have any idea what we have. I know that the support has been stronger than I expected from Democrats and from some Republicans that will vote with us.\"\n\nAt issue is whether to extend the miners' insurance program -- which serves retired miners and their spouses -- for one year or for just for the four month length of the GOP-authored spending bill, which is known as a continuing resolution or CR. \n\nOne person who is trying to build support for the measure is Manchin who was holed up in his office Friday talking to Democrats and some Republicans urging them to block the CR. Manchin, a moderate, had been scheduled to meet with Trump in New York Friday about a possible job in his administration but it was postponed until Monday so he could deal with the miners' issue. \n\nDemocrats are worried Manchin might leave the Senate to work for Trump, which could lead to a Republican pick up of his Senate seat. \n\nManchin is leading a pack of coal Senate Democrats -- including Brown, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania,  each of whom is up for re-election in two years --- to bolster the insurance benefits. Manchin has the support of at least one Republican, his fellow West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, while GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio is weighing whether to join the Democrats as well.\n\nBut even Manchin wouldn't predict that he has the 41 votes needed to scuttle the spending bill and force a change to help the miners.\n\n\"We have a strong commitment from our caucus, I can tell you that. Very strong,\" is as far as Manchin would go when asked specifically late Thursday if he had 41 votes. \n\nOne key Democrat has joined Manchin's battle. Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York vowed Thursday, \"We are going to win this fight.\"\n\nThere could be political dividends for Democrats making a full-throated fight for the miners, even at the risk of a potentially risky shutdown. Trump won big in coal country and Democrats would love to claw back some of those working class voters. \n\nAs he opened the chamber for what's been expected to be the final legislative day of the year, McConnell implored Democrats to accept the miners provision as it is and not recklessly shutdown the government over it.\n\n\"It's been my intention that the miner benefits not expire at the end of April next year,\" said McConnell.  I'm going to work with my colleagues to prevent that.  But this is a good time to take 'yes' for an answer.  We should pass the CR without delay.\"\n\nMcConnell noted that the bill passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support Thursday, a sign House Democrats were okay with the four month extension.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.44300138950348, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 642, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.6006197147, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.1806853582554497, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/health/parents-happiness-child-free-studies/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 931, "scraper_regex": 991}}, "headline": "Are people without kids happier?

I may be stressed, sleep-deprived and sorely in need of \"me\" time, but I am very satisfied with my life. Isn't it possible that I could be just as happy as someone without kids -- even if they have more time to sleep and take care of themselves?\n\nAccording to two recent studies, the answer might be yes and no.\n\nA report by Princeton University and Stony Brook University published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science found \"very little difference\" between the life satisfaction of parents and people without kids, once other factors -- such as income, education, religion and health -- were factored out, said Arthur Stone, one of the study's co-authors.\n\nPeople with kids living at home tend to have more money and are more highly educated, more religious and in better health, said Stone, a professor of psychiatry and psychology at Stony Brook University. \"All of those are factors that go along with people having better life evaluations.\"\n\nOnce those factors were statistically removed, the study found no difference in how satisfied the two groups felt about their lives.\n\nStone said in an interview that similarities in reported happiness among parents and the child-free, especially in developed countries like the United States, can be chalked up to priorities, specifically whether a person chooses to have kids. \n\n\"I choose an orange because I like oranges. You choose an apple because you like apples. There's no reason to think that your experiences should be any better than mine,\" said Stone. \"The orange is different than the apples. Having kids is different than not having kids. It doesn't mean that one is ... intrinsically better.\"\n\nSarah Maizes, author of the children's book \"On My Way to Bed\" and a mom of three in Los Angeles, agrees. \"It's like asking who's happier -- people who like pizza or people who like Chinese?\" she said on Facebook. \"Now what I'd like to know is who lives longer. ... That you can measure!\"\n\nThe Princeton-Stony Brook study -- which involved an examination of a survey of 1.8 million Americans, including parents between the ages of 34 and 46, conducted by Gallup from 2008 through 2012 -- did find one difference between parents and the childless: Parents tend to experience more highs and lows.\n\n\"They have higher highs. They have more joy in their lives, but also they have more stress and negative emotions as well,\" said Stone.\n\nAdina McGinley, a mom of three who lives outside New York, said that watching children grow \"is probably life's greatest joy.\" At the same time, she said, \"Stress over wanting your kids to have good lives can be tapped into at any time, sometimes to an awful degree, and this adds endless strain to marriage.\"\n\nThat strain can lead parents to feel less satisfied with their relationship, according to another study, this one by the Open University in England (PDF).\n\nIn that study, which involved surveys of more than 5,000 people in England and in the United States, the authors found childless couples were happier with their relationships and their partners than parents were, and were doing more work on their relationships than parenting couples. \n\nWhen asked who was the most important person in their lives, mothers said their children and fathers said their partners, the study found.\n\n\"(It) may be during those mid-years when people are parenting that there is a shift away from the relationship for women as they focus more on children,\" said Dr. Jacqui Gabb, one of the study's co-authors.\n\nGabb, who is a senior lecturer in social policy at the Open University, said this doesn't mean the relationships are not working.\n\n\"It just means there is a difference in emphasis and probably partly due to the time pinch,\" she added. \"There just isn't as much time to devote to the relationship.\"\n\nJen Bosse, a mom of two who blogs at Defining My Happy, said on Facebook, \"All too often when couples have kids, they begin to deprioritize one another. That's the problem, not the children.\"\n\nIronically, according to the Open University study, mothers were \"significantly happier with life\" than any other group including childless women -- a finding, Gabb says, that can be explained by how mothers said children were No. 1 in their lives.\n\n\"If they're the happiest with life but the least content with the level of relationship satisfaction and least happy with partners and least happy with the amount of maintenance (of the relationship), but they're happy with life, then there's got to be something,\" said Gabb.\n\nWhat's a parent or a non-parent to make of this latest, somewhat conflicting research?\n\nPerhaps the most actionable finding for our lives comes from the Open University study, aptly titled \"Enduring Love? Couple Relationships in the 21st Century.\"\n\nThe authors found that when asked what makes people feel most valued in their relationship, research participants said small acts of kindness.\n\n\"It's as little as saying 'I love you,' \" said Gabb. \"Out of everything in life, (mothers) identified having a cup of tea brought to them in bed as significant.\"\n\nIn the U.S., we might replace that cup of tea with a latte from Starbucks, but we all get the point. Relationships benefit from those everyday gestures. \n\n\"We need to think differently about what constitutes relationship work, and we need to think about, if it's those everyday small things that are important to people, then let's think about what those small things might be and start to be more attuned to what's going on in our own relationships,\" said Gabb.\n\nI think I'll be picking up a latte on my way home tonight!", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.5390625, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 931, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.56808125306, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161207050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.93340494092374, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/01/europe/istanbul-terror-attack-analysis-robertson/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 843, "scraper_regex": 963}}, "headline": "Istanbul terror attack: A bloody end to a grim year for Turkey", "wordcount_as_scraped": 963, "date": "20170101160000", "story_content": "In Istanbul's horrific New Year terror attack the message is clear: 2017 has begun, expect more of the same to come.\n\nThe echo of the black-clad gunman's bullets on such a globally festive night will reverberate long and hard.\n\nThe year 2016 had already laid a terrible and bloody foundation of terrorist mayhem for Turkey's citizens: Dozens of attacks, from Europe's easternmost tip in Istanbul through to Turkey's southern border with Syria. \n\nAt times last year it felt that barely a week went by between strikes, from a brazen gun and bomb raid at Istanbul's main international airport to carnage on the city's tourist-filled streets, to the assassination of Russia's ambassador in the capital, Ankara, 12 days ago. \n\nSuch was the crescendo of attacks in the last few months of 2016 that the terror at Reina nightclub had a feeling of inevitability about it -- if not there precisely, then someplace similar: upmarket, secular, serving alcohol.\n\nBarely two months ago, the US State Department warned that \"extremist groups are continuing aggressive efforts to attack US citizens in areas of Istanbul where they reside or frequent.\"\n\nIn a year, Turkey has gone from popular tourist destination to disturbingly dependable terror venue. That's not a reputation any country wants -- and particularly not Turkey, with its economy struggling following an attempted coup last summer. This has not come out of nowhere. \n\nREAD MORE: Dozens killed in upscale nightclub attack\n\nDecades of bloody conflict\n\nThere are two brands of terror targeting Turkey now: Kurdish and radical Islamist. \n\nIt would be easy to lay the blame for the growth of both at the feet of Turkey's increasingly autocratic and powerful President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but that would be to oversimplify the upheaval underway in this once secular country.\n\nYet Erdogan shapes Turkey's destiny more than any other single person. \n\nFour years ago he ended three decades of bloody conflict with the country's Kurds. They make up one fifth of Turkey's 80 million people. Tens of thousands died in a terror campaign as they fought the state for better rights.\n\nWith peace came popularity, a secular Kurdish party winning seats in the following national elections. But their gains threatened Erdogan's grip on parliamentary power. \n\nAs this was playing out, the war in neighboring Syria was heating up. The United States did a deal with Turkey to use its Incirlik airbase close to the Syrian border in order to strike ISIS targets. In return, Turkey agreed to strike \"terrorists\" too.\n\nBut when Turkey did, its focus wasn't ISIS, but its old foe the Kurds, whom, it was feared, were gaining ground inside Syria.\n\nWithin months, Turkey's war with the Kurds was back on; snap elections a few months later crippled the Kurdish vote and restored Erdogan's party's hold on government. \n\nBy 2016, Kurdish tit-for-tat bombings, ambushes and gun attacks -- mostly against military and police targets -- had become the ugly background music of the year.\n\nTransit point for ISIS recruits\n\nTo that already monstrous din, ISIS has added its own sordid battle noise.\n\nLike the renewed conflict with the Kurds, this too has its roots in Syria, and once again President Erdogan played a leading role in shaping its course.\n\nIn the early years of the Syrian uprising, Erdogan sought to unseat his onetime friend President Bashar al-Assad by backing Sunni rebels. \n\nUnlike the US and Europe, Erdogan didn't seem so picky about who benefited from his largesse, often choosing conservative Islamist rebels, rather than moderates. \n\nAs ISIS grew in strength, they profited from Turkey's policy toward rebels. Thousands upon thousands of ISIS recruits transited Turkey on their way to the war.\n\nNear-open borders allowed ISIS fighters and their weapons to pour across, and most damaging for Erdogan, resupply hubs, escape routes and safe houses to develop right under his nose. \n\nBefore the country belatedly tightened its border security, Turkey became riddled with ISIS.\n\nAs the war in Syria morphed and Russia moved in to save Assad, Erdogan began to reassess. With the US an ineffective partner in the war -- for his aims at least -- the Turkish leader turned to the increasingly influential Vladimir Putin in Moscow to cut a deal.\n\nThe assassination of the Russian ambassador by a Turkish policeman in Ankara the week before Christmas highlighted how swift an about-face Erdogan has executed. Few Turks expected his support of their co-religionists, the Sunni rebels, to wither so fast.\n\nTurkey in the crosshairs\n\nIt is clear however, that ISIS saw the writing on the wall. Turkey was transitioning from benign conduit to outright enemy. \n\nThey didn't immediately claim responsibility for the July attack on Ataturk airport, but by the end of the end of the year the gloves were off.  \n\nIn recent weeks, pro-ISIS groups had called for attacks in Turkey, urging lone wolf assaults on clubs, markets and movie theaters over the holiday season to turn them in to days of \"terror and blood.\"\n\nISIS waited barely 24 hours to claim responsibility for the Reina nightclub attack.\n\nNeither ISIS nor the Kurds have any reason to scale back their assault, and Turkey is well and truly in their crosshairs. \n\nThe Kurds will focus on military and police targets, civilian collateral an accepted part of their terror package. \n\nISIS will gravitate towards westerners and to undermining the Turkish state. They'll target tourists to hit the economy, and wage open war on Turkey's secularists to rive at the wound Erdogan has already opened between conservatives and the less religious.\n\nREAD MORE: Turkey can no longer conceal deep fault lines\n\nISIS' aim will be to create chaos, the Kurds' to continue a generational fight. Neither bodes well for Turkey, its neighbors in Europe or its allies in Washington.\n\nIt's clear that 2016 killed the status quo, and 2017 is already a dark canvas.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.18892526626587, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 843, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 18, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.91918154853, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170101160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.27046263345196, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/donald-trump-inauguration-religious-speakers/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 599, "scraper_regex": 689}}, "headline": "Religious leaders offer blessings", "wordcount_as_scraped": 689, "date": "20170120200000", "story_content": "Three religious leaders spoke after President Donald Trump at his inauguration Friday.

Who may dwell on your holy mountain? One who does what is right and speaks the truth; who knows that when you eat the labor of your hands, you are praiseworthy, that he who sows in tears shall reap in joy.\n\nBecause the freedoms we enjoy are not granted in perpetuity, but must be reclaimed by each generation. As our ancestors have planted for us, so we must plan for others. While it is not for us to complete the tasks, neither are we free to desist from them.\n\nDispense justice for the needy and the orphan, for they have no one but their fellow citizens. And because a nation's wealth is measured by her values and not by her vaults. Bless all of our allies around the world who share our beliefs. By the rivers of Babylon, we wept as we remembered Zion. If I forget thee, Oh, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.\n\nThe doer of all these shall never falter.\n\nMay the days come soon when justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness will abide in the fertile fields, and the work of righteousness will be peace, quietness and confidence forever. Amen.\n\nThe Rev. Franklin Graham, Samaritan's Purse and Billy Graham Evangelical Association\n\nMr. President, in the Bible, rain is a sign of God's blessing. And it started to rain, Mr. President, when you came to the platform. And it's my prayer that God will bless you, your family, your administration, and may he bless America.\n\nThe passage of Scripture comes from 1 Timothy 2: \n\n\"I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people -- for kings, for all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and it pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people.\"\n\nNow to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, the honor and glory, forever and ever. In Jesus name. Amen. \n\nBishop Wayne T. Jackson, Great Faith Ministries International\n\nWe thank you, Father, for letting us share this great moment together. Let us not take for granted the air we breathe or the life you've given us. We were all created by you with one blood, all nations to dwell upon this land together. We are not enemies; we are brothers and sisters. We're not adversaries, but we're allies. We're not foes, but we're friends.\n\nLet us be healed by the power of your love and united by the bond of your spirit. Today we pray for our 45th president, the vice president, and their families, and give them the wisdom to guide this great nation, the strength to protect it, and the hands to heal it.\n\nWe bless President Donald J. Trump. We ask that you give him the wisdom of Solomon, the vision of Joseph, and the meekness of Christ. Solomon, who kept peace among many nations; Joseph, who dreamt better for the people; and Christ, who accepted us all.\n\nOh, Lord, mend our hearts and stitch together the fabric of this great country.\n\nIn the spirit of the legendary gospel songwriter Mahalia Jackson\n\nOh, deep in my heart, I do believeThe lord will see us through, I do believeWe are on our way to victory, I do believeWe will walk hand in hand, I do believeWe shall live in peace, I do believeOh deep in my heart, I do believe America, we shall overcome\n\nAnd may the Lord bless and keep America and make his face shine upon us and be gracious unto us and give us peace.

Kelli remembers how they would wrinkle like a prune from being under water for too long while working at the first job he had in the US as a Syrian refugee.\n\n\"No one ever told me about gloves,\" he says laughing. \"I was washing dishes at nights and weekends to support my parents because my father couldn't work because he was sick.\"\n\nFor years, that's how he supported his family after they arrived in the United States. At 17, he would trek the 6 miles from the Atlanta suburb of Clarkston -- where his family settled in a low-income apartment -- to his job at the Mediterranean Grill just a few miles from where he now stands.\n\n\"I would see all the [Emory] students come in to eat and hope to one day be a college student myself,\" he says.  \"I always wanted to be a doctor. The prestige of being a doctor was a motivator. That was my American Dream.\"\n\nIn this lesson he leads, Kelli sees himself.\n\nNearly all of the 15 students are refugees.\n\nSix of them are from Somalia, another from the Ivory Coast. A handful are immigrants from places as diverse as Vietnam and Nepal. Three, like Kelli, are from the Middle East.\n\nJust like the kids who sit in front of him, Kelli, now 33, was a student at Clarkston High, a well-known destination for refugees. That was 15 years ago. Now he's returned as a doctor, determined to give back.\n\nThe journey\n\nKelli remembers his boyhood, when the Syrian government threw his father in jail for months. \n\n\"My father is a Kurd and as a civil lawyer at the time he was a prominent person in the community,\" the physician said. \"The Kurds are an oppressed minority in Syria; an ethnic group without a country. So, anyone who has power or acceptance in the local community, the government would be afraid they could start something.\"\n\nWhen Kelli's father refused the governments demand to work for them, he was jailed. It took a family friend's influence and money to help get him out of jail. \n\n\"After that, his close friend's advised him to leave the country,\" Kelli says. \"He went from being a lawyer to fighting heart disease and depression after what he went through. He was so prominent, and now in America he can't practice.\"\n\nThe family first made their way to Germany.\n\nTwo weeks after September 11, 2001, Heval Kelli arrived in the United States.\n\nIt was a strange time to be a Muslim, but the 17-year-old felt American almost from the moment he stepped foot in the country.\n\n\"I remember at the airport in New York, a man came up to me and started showing me pictures of his dog,\" Kelli told CNN. \"It was amazing. I didn't speak English, but this guy thought I did. He thought that I was American. It was an incredible feeling.\"\n\nEventually, Kelli, his younger brother and his parents resettled in Clarkston.\n\nLife was a struggle.\n\nIn the months that followed, the student would wash dishes, hoping to make enough money to not only support his family, but also one day send himself to medical school.\n\nBut it was only just a dream.\n\n\"It was hard to think about becoming a doctor when you're learning English and struggling as a refugee,\" he says. \"I wished then that I had a mentor to motivate me,\" he added.\n\n\"Living in Clarkston, in poor neighborhoods, your neighbors are not doctors and engineers and lawyers. So you lack that role model and the motivation.\"\n\nKelli's vision may have stayed only a dream if it wasn't for an act of serendipity. Kelli's younger brother, who had obtained an academic scholarship at a private high school in Atlanta, mentioned to a classmate that his older brother wanted to be a doctor. As chance would have it, the classmate's father was a heart surgeon and Emory School of Medicine professor.\n\nIt was the mentor Kelli needed to make the push to become a future doctor. More than a decade later, Kelli is a cardiology fellow at Emory University.\n\n\"The restaurant [where I used to wash dishes] is one block away from where I train as a cardiology fellow today,\" he says.\n\nBut perhaps even more unimaginable for Kelli, is coming back to Clarkston High as a doctor and, more importantly, as a mentor.\n\nThe need to invest\n\n\"Intelligence is relative, but everyone can be a hard worker,\" Kelli says to one of the students in the monthly session.\n\nThe group is part of the Young Physicians Initiative, or YPI, an after-school program Kelli started in the fall at his former high school.\n\nYears ago, he noticed first-hand the void of mentors in Clarkston, so he began the program to give back. The goal is to inspire others like him to pursue a career in medicine.\n\n\"I feel the obligation as a physician that my service goes beyond patient care: I need to invest in the community,\" he says. \"So we started the Young Physicians Initiative as a way to re-create my story in Clarkston.\"\n\nHe partnered with Emory University and recruited his medical students to start a premedical education program for high schoolers.\n\n\"I thought that I had it hard, but these kids struggle with having two jobs, taking care of their sick parents, and (they) are still motivated to become a doctor.\"\n\nStudents like 18-year-old high school senior Christopher Keke, who works at a day care to support his family, while also going to school and attending the YPI after-school program.\n\n\"Being the first generation going to college, I would say that it's very important,\" Keke, whose family immigrated as refugees from West Africa, told CNN. \"I have no option. I'm doing it for my family, and also for myself  for a better living. I want to give back, not just to my community, but for my parents for all the suffering and hard work they've done. I want to show them that it wasn't for nothing.\"\n\nHe says: \"I just want to change the world.\"\n\nKelli believes that Keke and the others in the YPI program will one day change the world. In fact, they've already changed his, as he has theirs.\n\nKelli does what he does, in part, to honor the legacy of his father. \n\n\"I always tell people this country is great,\" Kelli says. \"The greatness of this country is our interactions and diversity. If I, as a refugee, could come here and become a physician 15 years later across from the restaurant where I used to wash dishes ... this is the American Dream, and everyone could do that.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 24, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.0843170285224915, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1071, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.648183745009999, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.828197945845, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/30/health/donald-trump-presidents-diets/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1104, "scraper_regex": 1187}}, "headline": "The president's diet and what it says about America", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1187, "date": "20161201020000", "story_content": "Thomas Jefferson may have been America's first foodie. The Founding Father developed a taste for French cuisine, grew a vast vegetable garden and cherished a farm-to-table diet.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was more of a modest eater. According to historians, the 16th president \"liked apples and hot coffee,\" and didn't demand much in a meal.\n\nOn the other hand, Ronald Reagan was known for his sweet tooth. The country's 40th president munched on jelly beans to quit smoking and quickly fell in love with the candy, often keeping a stash nearby in the White House.\n\nNow, it seems that a fast food connoisseur will enter the White House.\n\n \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has been known to favor Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald's and the taco bowls that are whipped up in Trump Tower's kitchen.\n\n\"But he's not the first one to like McDonald's and Burger King and occasionally that wonderful Popeyes chicken,\" said William Seale, a historian and journal editor with the White House Historical Association.\n\n\"Fast food makes its way through the doors of the White House. From time to time, presidents or even guests will order a Big Mac or the like, and the Secret Service will go pick it up,\" Seale said. \"The Carter children did that and George W. Bush, too.\"\n\nBill Clinton also was known to enjoy items on the McDonald's menu, so much so that his eating habits were parodied on Saturday Night Live. \n\nAfter all, the eating habits of American presidents seem to mirror the ever-evolving diets of the American people, said Suzy Evans, a Newport Beach, California-based literary agent, historian and author of the forthcoming children's book \"Abraham Lincoln's Lunch.\"\n\n\"Presidential culinary history might seem insignificant or even trivial,\" Evans said. \"But if you look closely enough, it can teach us much about American social, cultural and political history and the rich and venerable history of dining, diplomacy and the American presidency.\"\n\nThe president who just wanted cornbread \n\nWhen it comes to America's interest in food, there was an infatuation with European cuisine in the late 1700s and early 1800s. That seemed to shift around the late 1800s -- a change that was reflected in James Polk's food preferences. He was the 11th president of the United States.\n\n\"President Polk was a very finicky eater, and he didn't like the fancy food that came up from the White House kitchen,\" Seale said. \"He wrote of a banquet repast in his diary, 'I saw the food and I couldn't tell what it was. It must have been French' ... Instead, he asked for turnip greens and cornbread.\"\n\nBefore about 1950, nearly all presidents thrived on natural food from the farm, Seale said. Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman preferred such dishes as turnips, string beans, beets and other farm products, prepared in the simplest ways.\n\n\"The Roosevelts used to send things from their Hyde Park vegetable garden down to the White House,\" Seale said. \n\n\"They drank pure whole milk, meats and other products from their Hudson River farm,\" he said. \"The coming of restaurants and specialist chefs changed that in the sense that creative and even exotic dishes teased the public interest. Plain roast beef became buried in sauces. Especially during the Kennedy administration did international cooking, particularly French, take over the White House kitchens.\"\n\nIn the late 1800s, large meals and increasingly sedentary lifestyles had become the norm for wealthier Americans.\n\nAs a result, several presidents in the mid-19th century to early 20th century -- from William Howard Taft to Theodore Roosevelt -- had rotund body types, said Amy Bentley, a historian and professor of food studies at New York University.\n\n\"This is an era of increased food supply and the industrialization of food. For men especially, large bodies are emblematic of one's power,\" Bentley said. \"A large, rotund body is in effect saying, 'I don't have to do manual labor' and 'I have enough food.' \"\n\nBy the post-World War II era, the American population began to suffer health conditions that are associated with the overindulgence of food, such as heart disease and hypertension.\n\n\"Right around the World War II period, you get more concerns about health, and that is somewhat reflected in the presidency,\" Bentley said. \n\nDwight D. Eisenhower, for instance, suffered a heart attack in 1955. Afterward, the 34th president modified his diet and avoided fats.\n\nMany presidents since Eisenhower have consumed health-conscious diets.\n\n'Ketchup on cottage cheese for health'\n\nEvans, the author in Newport Beach, described such nutrition-focused diets as \"food-as-fuel\" eating.\n\n\"Healthy, 'food-as-fuel' kind of guys could include Woodrow Wilson, a wartime president, and John F. Kennedy, and while Barack Obama does occasionally indulge in pizzas, burgers and ice cream, the Obama's kitchen garden on the White House lawn is part of a long culinary tradition,\" Evans said.\n\nAdditionally, \"Richard Nixon would slather ketchup on cottage cheese for health reasons,\" she said. \n\nBy the late 20th century, nutritional studies emerged that linked weight with health concerns and heart disease with diet, Bentley said. Therefore, notions of a healthy diet played a larger role in presidents' eating habits.\n\n\"At some point, breakfast turned from fried eggs and bacon to cereal, skim milk, toast, coffee, juice. So you start seeing presidential styles of eating (be) a reflection of national trends,\" Bentley said.\n\nClinton, whose appetite for junk food and sweets while in the White House was well known, adopted a healthier diet after his term ended. He now considers himself a vegan. \n\n\"I was lucky I did not die of a heart attack,\" Clinton said of his eating habits in a 2011 interview with CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\n\nThis focus on health also was evident in the 2000s in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nWhile in office, the American public watched Bush pursue a healthy lifestyle, Evans said. Bush would eat healthy snacks, such as pretzels. In fact, in 2002, he choked on a pretzel and afterward, jokingly told reporters, \"Always chew your pretzels before you swallow.\"\n\n\"It may be that earlier presidents were similarly vigilant about their health, but with George W. Bush, it was seen as important to promote his healthy habits as a way to shape his persona,\" Bentley said. \"That just goes into high gear with the Obamas.\"\n\nA throwback?\n\nThe Obamas not only introduced healthier meals and snacks to the White House, but also promoted healthy eating as a major national issue with first lady Michelle Obama's health and wellness-focused \"Let's Move\" initiative.\n\n\"The Obamas are very calorie-conscious and health-conscious, which is a reflection of the first lady. Her vegetable garden is a serious thing, something permanent for White House residents to come,\" Seale said, \"In Mrs. Obama's parting, her garden has been endowed handsomely by the Burpee seed company.\"\n\nNow, with the Trump administration, Bentley said, we might see a different model of eating that might be something of a \"throwback to the post-World War II era of being enamored with the qualities of fast food.\"\n\n\"You could argue that Trump's food aesthetic is similar to this earlier post-World War II era, where the dominant values for food were sameness, predictability and quantity over quality,\" she said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.4814814329147301, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1104, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.99917348541, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161201020000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.8985507246376803, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/17/opinions/theresa-may-brexit-confidence-merrick-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Theresa May's Brexit confidence is deeply misguided", "wordcount_as_scraped": 533, "date": "20170117170000", "story_content": "It has finally happened. After months of stalling, of saying nothing but \"Brexit means Brexit,\" British Prime Minister Theresa May has set out her plan for how she wants the UK to leave the European Union.\n\nThe Prime Minister wants a clean break with the EU bloc. Most importantly, this will mean Britain leaving the single market. It is the \"hard Brexit\" that Nigel Farage, the right-wing press and many of her Conservative MPs wanted -- and that many of the 16,141,241 people who voted Remain feared. \n\nBritain also will give up its full membership in the EU customs union -- spelling higher tariffs for UK exports to the EU -- but could remain as an associate member. That negotiation starts now.\n\nMay's 12-point \"Plan for Global Britain,\" unveiled in central London on Tuesday, provides more detail than had been expected in Westminster. Now she has to persuade other EU leaders to accept it.\n\nThe Prime Minister will be cheered on by pro-Brexit British newspapers and Tory MPs who are overjoyed with her plan because Britain will save billions of pounds by no longer contributing to the EU budget and can close its doors to immigrants by giving up freedom of movement.\n\nMay acts as if her negotiating hand is strong and talks of a \"new and equal partnership\" with the EU. One of the key phrases from her speech was that \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" -- if EU leaders do not accept her terms, she will walk away.\n\nBasking in praise from anti-EU populists, she has a false sense of security in her own position. This is a dangerous place to be.\n\nWalking away from a \"bad deal\" would mean no free trade deal with the EU, which would be punishing for British businesses, the City of London and the wider UK economy. The short-term sense of triumph that the Prime Minister and the pro-Brexit camp feel now will likely turn into long-term pain for the UK economy.\n\nCrucially, May underestimates how dimly Germany and France view Britain's exit from the EU and with it the withdrawal from the post-war dream of European harmony and political unity. \n\nThe Leave side says that no matter what happens, however bumpy the negotiations between the UK and Brussels will be, Germany will still want to sell its cars to the UK, as will France its wine. Trade will win out.\n\nYet this is not how Germany's Angela Merkel sees Brexit. Germany and France -- for now, led by a pro-EU president -- will not reward the UK for leaving the EU. In fact, they are likely to impose tariffs on UK trade as a price for leaving.\n\nThat post-war dream of European unity has always been more important to Germany and France than it has to the British public. The European  \"superstate\" that populist politicians like Nigel Farage have spent years claiming was the ultimate goal of the EU is one of the main reasons ordinary Britons voted Leave. \n\nYet it is also the very reason why Merkel and her fellow EU leaders will be willing to play hardball with May in the coming months.\n\nWhen it comes to preserving the EU project, politics will trump economics.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.36518776416779, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 552, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.04511531354, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.98550724637681, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/27/opinions/two-issues-topped-may-agenda-in-trump-meeting-maltby/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "What Britons wanted from May's Trump meeting", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1120, "date": "20170128030000", "story_content": "Britain and America, it has been said, are two countries divided by a common language. Ahead of Prime Minister Theresa May's presser with President Donald Trump on Friday -- the first for Trump with a foreign head of government -- that capacity for near-miss communication was fully on display.\n\nRight from the start, in fact -- the traveling British press corps was temporarily denied access after some confusion over credentials and the use of the dd-mm-yy birthdate format (something used not just in Britain, but much of the world).\n\nFor May, the most critical audience was always going to be the British public, with whom Trump is wildly unpopular. She needs to watch her back: Britain, like America, is enduring choppy political waters. May was elected by the Conservative Party to replace David Cameron as prime minister in July 2016, which has left some questioning her mandate from the British people as a whole.\n\nGenerally viewed as a steady pair of hands to manage the shock Brexit result that ended Cameron's political career, she has occasionally stumbled in the face of the mammoth task. What protects her -- so far -- is the hopeless performance of the hard-left opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has proved unable to unify the Labour Party.\n\nBritain's social conscience has been outraged by Trump's campaign rhetoric over the use of torture. It's not just campaigners who are worried -- Britain's spooks are concerned that American use of torture may actually reduce the amount of US intelligence they can use. After all, the European Court of Human Rights -- an entity separate from the European Union, to which Britain at present remains a signatory -- limits the extent to which security officers can act on intelligence they believe to have been obtained by an allied nation through the use of torture. \n\nThe British government's interrogation policy, published following a lawsuit by activists, bans spies from involvement in situations where they know or believe that torture will occur. It does allow officers to interact with detainees where they reasonably believe a British presence will \"mitigate the risk of mistreatment\" during interrogation, by obtaining \"reliable caveats or assurances\" from their foreign partners.\n\nYet with President Trump openly calling for the use of waterboarding on the campaign trail, it may be harder for British spies to claim such Pollyannaish deniability about the activities of their American colleagues, especially if they end up in a European court.\n\nMay was under pressure to confront Trump over torture before she left London. So it was no surprise that a BBC journalist used the first British question in the Trump-May press conference to address British concern over Trump's \"alarming beliefs,\" citing his praise for torture at the top of a four-part list. \n\nBut that is not the only pressure point for the British Prime Minister in Washington. Throughout the recent EU referendum, critics of the European Union promised British voters they could hope for a better trade deal by looking to America as a major partner. \n\nThen-President Barack Obama caused some resentment here by declaring Britain would be at \"the back of the queue\" for deals should it leave the EU, and some saw Trump's seeming love affair with all things Brexit as a potential opening. So there was consternation in Britain following Trump's inaugural address, which seemed to herald a new era of trade tariffs and protectionism. (\"Two simple rules: buy American and hire American.\")\n\nThus May faced domestic pressure to deliver on two things: An American promise to refrain from torture -- however loosely defined -- and the promise of a major US-UK trade deal exempted from Trump's protectionist rhetoric.\n\nShe made some headway, at least judging from some careful parsing of President Trump's noncommittal language. Trump promised to demur to Defense Secretary James Mattis, a waterboarding skeptic, on the matter of torture, while both leaders spoke of a beginning trade negotiations as soon as possible.\n\nMore importantly, May avoided any major dramas while sharing a podium with the mercurial new President. (Awkward images of Trump taking her hand during a walk through the White House colonnades hit front pages, but will probably only be classed as a lucky escape).\n\nStill, some in Britain will not forgive May for her haste to meet the new President. And it's true that her appearance beside Donald Trump, in the White House Palm Room, did seem to help \"normalize\" him as a legitimate international leader. Trump's critics will even be disappointed that the political insurgent avoided any of his characteristic outbursts, which may reassure other world leaders concerned about sharing a podium in future. \n\nThe President's decision, hours after she left the White House, to curb the entry of Muslims to the US -- including Muslim refugees from Syria -- will immediately tarnish May's claims to have lured him into the diplomatic mainstream, at least with liberal British audiences. But May was also unafraid to school Trump in front of GOP leaders Thursday night, invoking Ronald Reagan when warning him to be wary of Russia.\n\nReagan is a hard authority for a Republican president to ignore, especially when invoked by a female Tory Prime Minister. Liberal British commentators would have preferred May to reach out to Democrats -- Britain's friendship, she could have added, extends to all American citizens and not just those who voted for Trump. But with a populace back home genuinely fearful of Mr Trump's trigger finger and short temper, flattering him was praised even by UK outlets as the best way to keep British citizens safer.\n\nThe only painful moment for May came during her first appearance at the White House. In an icy photo call, both leaders were photographed by a bust of Winston Churchill, which the President is said to have moved back to the Oval Office at the request of Mrs May's UKIP opponent, Nigel Farage. \n\nFarage is a largely discredited figure in Britain -- exiled from the official Brexit campaign, which was run by more mainstream figures. But he has made much of his friendship with the new US President. The alleged disrespect shown by President Obama to Churchill has been one of his favorite ways to rally wounded British pride among nationalists. (In reality, Obama's \"snub\" has been shown to be largely a misunderstanding).\n\nOf course, few Americans will fully appreciate the indignity for May of being trapped in a photo shoot that highlights a Farage diplomatic victory. But she is unlikely anyway to worry too much. Obama may not have been Britain's favorite president, but his approval ratings far outstrip those of Trump.\n\nSo, while Farage may have won the early race to be President Trump's best British buddy, May knows full well that the British public expect her to be a wary partner, not a pandering friend.

I've had successes and I've had setbacks. Sometimes, really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional public and political careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too.\n\n \n\nThis loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it.\n\n \n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n \n\nCLINTON: It is -- it is worth it.\n\n \n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n \n\nAnd so we need -- we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.\n\n \n\nAnd to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion.\n\n \n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n \n\nNow, I -- I know -- I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.\n\n \n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n \n\nAnd -- and to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.\n\n \n\nFinally...\n\n \n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n \n\nFinally, I am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me. I count my blessings every single day that I am an American.

And there is more work to do.\n\n \n\nI am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election.\n\n \n\nMay God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.\n\n \n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 4.70588254928589, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1044, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.8440680930699997, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161109180000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 6, "pct_mft_words": 3.5440613026819903, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/opinions/nixons-cabinet-naftali/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Team Trump, don't repeat Nixon's mistake", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1185, "date": "20161111230000", "story_content": "When Richard Nixon had a hard time sleeping during the 1968 campaign, he would take a sleeping pill, have a scotch and start calling people. \"[The calls] were filled with late at night anxiety,\" recalled campaign aide Leonard Garment in 2007 for the Nixon Library, \"fear, sleeplessness, and the knowledge that he had to get to sleep. ...\"  These calls came at midnight or later and they often involved the candidate just rambling. \n\nThe erratic behavior did not end with the campaign and soon became a problem for the new administration. White House chief of staff H.R. \"Bob\" Haldeman concluded that he had to design a system to protect the President from himself. As Haldeman would describe it in his memoir, \"The Ends of Power,\" it involved a \"conspiracy to keep the dark side down; the light side up.\" \n\nThe tipping point for Haldeman came only six months into the administration, when Nixon ordered wiretaps on every sub-Cabinet official who was in the White House Situation Room. Nixon also dreamed up a scheme that had staffer Pat Buchanan work up a fake National Security Council document to leave in the Situation Room to see if it, too, leaked. \n\n\"I realized that many problems in our administration arose not solely from the outside, but from inside the Oval Office \u2014 and even deeper, from inside the character of Richard Nixon,\" Haldeman wrote years later.\n\nIt is much too early to say whether Donald Trump will challenge Richard Nixon for the distinction of being the most unstable personality to inhabit the White House in the modern era. His behavior during the campaign, however, does raise some red flags. So, as Donald Trump begins putting together his core group of about 30 advisers and top administration officials -- a chief of staff, Cabinet members -- during this transition, it is useful to see how the US government evolved 40 years ago to meet the challenge of an erratic commander in chief: where the effort succeeded and, sadly, where and why it ultimately failed. The consequences of that failure would have not only domestic but also major global consequences.\n\nOne of the persistent myths about our system of government is that the presidency is as much about the advisers around the President as the individual in the Oval Office. This is a case often made when major party candidates lack foreign policy experience. \"Don't worry about X,\" goes the argument, he has good advisers. \n\nBut history, which can speak out of both sides of its mouth on many things, is quite clear on the limits of the significance of presidential advisers: Consensus is rare, the top advisers more often than not disagree, leaving the agony of decision to the President. Bob Gates' beautifully written memoir on his years as secretary of defense for two presidents, for example, underscored that it was President Obama who decided how to go after Osama Bin Laden, when his advisers \u2014including Gates \u2014 could not agree.  \n\nThe Constitution makes the President, or chief executive, what George W. Bush later famously called  \"the Decider.\" The election of Nixon meant that for four years, at least, there would be a psychological instability at the center of that strong executive. \n\n Fortunately for the nation, Nixon chose strong individuals to run the Pentagon, who were self-confident enough to try to shield the armed services from an erratic commander in chief. Melvin Laird, a former congressional colleague of Nixon's, was a grounded man with an independent power base who was prepared and clever enough to find ways to prevent bad presidential orders from taking effect.\n\n In his authorized biography, former Secretary of Defense Laird tells the chilling story of a late-night call from Nixon in September 1970. The radical Palestinian terrorist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, had just hijacked four planes and flown two of them to an abandoned British airfield in Jordan. The Nixon team debated what to do. Later, in the residence, Nixon apparently lost his patience. \n\n \"[B]omb the bastards,\" said Nixon, slurring his words, and then ordering the use of jets from the carrier Independence. Laird thought the order nonsensical. The only likely effect would have been to ensure the deaths of the approximately 180 passengers held hostage, when at that point they were not actually in any great danger. But Nixon wanted to send a signal to the Soviets, who sponsored the Popular Front.  \n\nFortunately for the hostages, all of whom eventually made it home alive, and for US Middle East relations, Laird prevaricated. \"I told him,\" Laird later recalled for his biographer Dale Van Atta, \"we would do the best we could. I didn't have a big argument about it; I just didn't do it.\"\n\n In the waning days of the Nixon administration in 1974, James Schlesinger ordered the Pentagon not to implement a presidential order unless it came directly from Richard Nixon. He then told Gen. George Scratchley Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \"that ... all the service chiefs should be aware that if there were any messages from the White House, I should be informed immediately.\" \n\nSchlesinger worried that Nixon had loyal lieutenants who might want to move troops around the Washington area as a show of force. By that stage in his career, Nixon would not issue this kind of order directly but had created a climate in which someone might order it for him. \n\nThe efforts by Haldeman, Laird and Schlesinger to contain Nixon's instability were only as good as the men around the President. Haldeman's 2-year-old containment system ultimately broke down because Haldeman was himself not a good man. \n\nHe shared Nixon's hatred of political opponents, his racism and his anti-Semitism, doing nothing to stop the creation of the Plumbers unit, the hiring of Teamster \"thugs\" to do physical harm to anti-war demonstrators, the politicization of the IRS and the counting of and discrimination against Jewish Americans in the part of the Labor Department that determines the unemployment rate, a so-called \"sensitive area.\"  \n\nA year later, in 1972, at the request of the President, Haldeman would loyally authorize a \"dirty tricks campaign\" and, also likely at Nixon's request, a political spying unit that repurposed the Plumbers team. Lacking anyone in the White House with the authority and moral center of Melvin Laird or James Schlesinger at the Pentagon, the Nixon administration was soon overwhelmed by the consequences of the stream of criminal orders from a President who lacked self-control.  \n\nAs Hillary Clinton explained in her concession speech, we owe our new President \"an open mind.\" Nevertheless, the choices Donald J. Trump makes for his Cabinet and his White House team will say a lot about how he intends to govern and be governed.\n\n Does he choose a Cabinet of equals, who might be able to stop him from making the inevitable rookie mistakes? Will his inner circle at the White House be dominated by people who magnify the darker impulses he expressed in his tweets or by those who would contain the anxieties, doubts and prejudices for the good of the man and the country he will very soon lead?", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.6418025493621804, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1208, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.80701966051, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 47, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161111230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 7, "pct_mft_words": 3.8907284768211903, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/health/election-crisis-suicide-prevention-hotlines/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1163, "scraper_regex": 1260}}, "headline": "Calls to crisis and suicide prevention hotlines surge post-election", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1260, "date": "20161111230000", "story_content": "In the wee hours of November 9, when the US presidential race approached its stunning end, John Draper and those he works with saw a different surprising result. The phone lines at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline lit up in a way not seen before.\n\nBetween 1 and 2 a.m. alone, Draper said, the national network fielded 660 calls. The volume was two to three times what it had been, and that was on a night when calls were already on a dramatic upswing, increasing as polls closed and returns came in, the lifeline's director said.\n\nIt's a trend that's played out with other services too, and the direct link to the election was \"pretty undeniable,\" said Draper, who's spent about 25 years working in the suicide prevention and crisis intervention field. \"I can't say I've seen anything like this. ... And it's certainly not something I've ever seen in an election.\" \n\nHe saw a spike in calls after the September 11 terrorist attacks, when he ran a New York City hotline. But not since comedian and actor Robin Williams killed himself in 2014 has this national lifeline, established in 2005, seen such a surge. That dramatic uptick (much bigger than after the election) was tied to the media's steady and pervasive promotion of the lifeline's number. \n\nIn this case, the number wasn't promoted anywhere in relation to the election, and desperate callers -- with pre-existing anxieties that were triggered by this national event, he emphasized -- sought out the lifeline. That's what made the spike in calls so unexpected, though the eventual content was less of a surprise.\n\n\"They call and say it's the election,\" Draper said. \"But by the end of the call, it's about their lives, and that's when we can help them.\" \n\nCalls to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which includes a network of more than 160 crisis centers, have since leveled off. But that's not the case for other services.\n\nOngoing flood of calls\n\nLike the national lifeline, the Crisis Text Line -- which connects texters with crisis counselors -- saw swelling numbers as the election results unfolded. Between midnight and 1 a.m. Wednesday, it saw eight times the normal volume of texts, spokeswoman Liz Eddy said. \n\nOn an average day, this crisis line sees about 1,000 texters. From 7 a.m. Tuesday to Wednesday morning, that number jumped to 2,000. Then, from Wednesday morning to Thursday morning, it continued to climb to 4,000. \n\nThe Crisis Text Line also saw a surge after Williams committed suicide. Its numbers also climbed after the 2015 Paris and San Bernardino terrorist attacks, when texters who identified as Muslim shared fears about how they'd be treated, Eddy said. But the US election is the first time this new service, founded in 2013, has seen reactions bubble up in response to politics.\n\nIn a release Eddy sent out, she said that \"election\" and \"scared\" were the top two words mentioned by texters in the 24 hours after the election. And the phrase most commonly associated with \"scared\" was \"LGBTQ.\"\n\nThe Trevor Project is the national leader in providing crisis and suicide prevention support to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth. Last year, the organization fielded 54,000 contacts -- made by phone, online chat or text -- according to Steve Mendelsohn, its deputy executive director. \n\nThe normal call volume, Mendelsohn said, doubled as a result of the election and has stayed constant. He said more than 95% of those reaching out have talked about the election. \n\n\"It's been ongoing since Tuesday night,\" he explained. \"Young people are calling us who've never called us before. They're scared, and they don't know who to turn to. ... Given all the rhetoric that they've heard leading up to the election, it makes sense that they're frightened.\" \n\nMendelsohn wasn't able to share exact numbers, saying the organization is more concerned with fielding calls than with running statistical analysis. But he was able to provide some context.\n\nThe last time the Trevor Project saw such an extreme uptick in traffic came in 2012, when an episode of the TV show \"Glee\" included an attempted suicide and featured a Trevor Project PSA. Like the media's influence on calls to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline after Williams' death, this barrage of contacts was expected. \n\nMore recently, Mendelsohn said, there was a spike in unanticipated calls in June, after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida. The post-election volume, he said, is 70% higher than it was then.\n\nWhere it's 'basically apocalyptic'\n\nLesbian, gay and bisexual youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers. Among young transgender people, nearly half admit to having seriously considered ending their lives, and one-quarter report having attempted suicide. This is according to statistics outlined on the Trevor Project website.\n\nWhen you factor in transgender people of all ages, the attempted suicide rates are grimmer. \n\nForty-six percent of trans men (female-to-male) and 42% of trans women (male-to-female) have attempted suicide, according to a 2014 survey (PDF) conducted by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law.\n\nThe election results and what they may portend have crushed the transgender community, said Greta Martel, co-founder and executive director of the 2-year-old Trans Lifeline. This crisis hotline has been flooded with more calls than it can take.\n\nOn a normal day, the Trans Lifeline fields 50 to 60 calls, Martel said. When North Carolina's House Bill 2, commonly referred to as the \"bathroom bill,\" was at its height in the news, the lifeline got as many as 250 calls a day. But since the election, and with no sign of abating, the service is getting more than 500 calls a day. Given its scrappy, startup size, she says, its workers are lucky if they can answer 200 a day. \n\nCallers are panicked about what lies ahead for them, she said. A repeal of the Affordable Care Act could result in a loss of insurance and the trans-affirming health care they'd finally secured, she said. What will that mean for the hormones they rely on and the surgeries they've planned?\n\n\"It's just overwhelming,\" Martel said. \"It's basically apocalyptic right now. I don't know what's going to fix this for us.\" \n\nShe said the staff at Trans Lifeline is doing all it can to support the community, but given what they're seeing right now, they need help to train more volunteers and beef up their efforts.\n\nHow to help a person in crisis\n\nIf you or someone you know is having a mental health crisis or suicidal thoughts, no matter what the trigger, these national services exist to provide people with support and the reminder that they are not alone.\n\nBeyond what a counselor can say directly, here are some ideas to help lift people up. \n\nBe there for each other. Get back to a routine. Limit exposure to conversations or media -- social or otherwise -- that aggravates feelings of hopelessness. These are just some of the ways in which people can help themselves right now, said Draper, of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.\n\nThis election ignited for some pre-existing worries and feelings of loss, he said, and once people begin controlling what they can control, the darkness should lift.\n\nOne of the best ways to help yourself, he suggested, is to help others through acts of kindness and compassion. Volunteer at a place that matters to you. Get involved with a cause that speaks to your core. \n\n\"Bind that anxiety through action,\" he said. \"Creating a more kind, personal atmosphere is really needed right now.\" ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.6641221046447794, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1163, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.6770451665699992, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161111230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.3215821152192597, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/world/germany-isis-arrests/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Germany: Five ISIS recruiters arrested ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 625, "date": "20161108190000", "story_content": "Five key ISIS recruiters have been arrested in Germany, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nThe men were allegedly involved in smuggling people out of Germany to join the terror group fighting in Syria, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said in a statement.\n\nAhmad Abdulaziz Abdullah -- a 32-year-old Iraqi national also known as \"Abu Walaa\" -- was  the ringleader of the multi-regional recruitment network, according to the statement.\n\nFederal prosecutors said he openly acknowledged belonging to ISIS, and was a speaker at several radical gatherings of Salafists and jihadists.\n\nThe other suspects include a 50-year-old Turkish citizen identified as Hasan C., and a 36-year-old with double German and Serbian nationality named as Boban S., according to the statement. Their job was to teach Arabic and radical Islamic beliefs to those willing to go to Syria, the statement said.\n\nA 27-year-old German, Mahmoud O., and a 26-year-old Cameroonian identified as Ahmed F.Y.  organized and carried out the trips to Syria, according to the prosecutors.\n\nThe five suspects are believed to have targeted and radicalized young Muslims in the states of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia in the northwest of the country.\n\nOther terrorists awaiting orders\n\nGerman officials tell CNN the country is now facing an unprecedented terrorist threat. \n\nGerman officials are concerned there are other ISIS cells and radicalized people inside Germany in touch with ISIS and awaiting orders to strike.\n\nMore than 820 extremists have left Germany to join jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, with most linking up with ISIS, according to German officials.\n\nAbout  270 have returned to Germany, more than a quarter of whom are believed to have been involved in fighting or to have received paramilitary training.\n\nAccording to the testimony of Harry Sarfo, a convicted German ISIS recruit arrested on his return to Germany in July 2015, ISIS has found it more difficult to persuade its German recruits to return to launch attacks than French and Belgian nationals in its ranks. \n\nThis led the group to focus on two other avenues to attack Germany: establishing communication with extremists already in Germany to persuade them to strike and infiltrating non-European operatives into the country, by taking advantage of last year's migrant crisis.\n\nString of incidents\n\nIn July a Syrian asylum seeker blew himself up outside a music festival in Ansbach, Bavaria. He had been communicating via Whatsapp with a suspected ISIS handler overseas, a German intelligence official told CNN. \n\nThat same month an Afghan carried out a knife attack on a train in Wurzburg, Bavaria. A German intelligence official told CNN German investigators have established he was also in touch ahead of the attack with a suspected different ISIS operative overseas. \n\nIn September three suspected Syrian Islamic State operatives were arrested in Schleswig-Holstein. They arrived in Germany in November last year after posing as Syrian refugees. German investigators believe they were dispatched to launch an attack by the same network behind the Paris attacks. \n\nIn October German security agencies thwarted a plot to bomb a Berlin airport by a Syrian refugee who arrived in Germany in February 2015. He is suspected of having connections to ISIS and was arrested after two other Syrian nationals tipped off authorities and tied the man up. He killed himself in jail soon after he was taken into custody. Police found TATP, the same explosive used in the Paris and Brussels attack, in a residence he used as a bomb factory.\n\nAnd earlier this month a Tunisian who had entered Europe as a Syrian refugee in October 2015 was arrested in Berlin. He is suspected to be an ISIS operative tasked with launching an attack in Germany and was in contact with a member of the group's external operations wing in Syria, Germany's Federal Prosecutor's Office stated last week.

They used that data to adjust the cervical cancer deaths rates.\n\nBefore the adjustment, the data showed that the cervical cancer killed about 5.7 out of 100,000 black women and 3.2 per 100,000 white women. After adjusting for hysterectomies, the rate was 10.1 per 100,000 black women and 4.7 per 100,000 white women.\n\nThe data showed that the racial disparity seen in cervical cancer death rates for black and white women was underestimated by 44% when hysterectomies were not taken into account. \n\n\"We can't tell from our study what might be contributing to the differences in cervical cancer mortality by age and race,\" Rositch said. \"Now that we have a better understanding of the magnitude of the problem, we have to understand the reasons underlying the problem.\"\n\nCervical cancer is highly preventable in the United States because of the availability of screening tests and a vaccine to prevent human papillomavirus, or HPV, which can cause cervical cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"Racial disparity may be explained by lack of access or limited access to cervical cancer screening programs among black women when compared to whites,\" said Dr. Marcela del Carmen, a gynecologic oncologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n\"This gap and disparity need to be addressed with initiatives focusing on better access to prevention or screening programs, better access to HPV vaccination programs and improved access and adherence to standard of care treatment for cervical cancer,\" she said.\n\nThe new findings add to the current understanding of cervical cancer's impact on different communities, said Dr. John Farley, a practicing gynecologic oncologist and professor at Creighton University School of Medicine at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Arizona.\n\n\"It lets us know that there is substantial work to do to investigate and alleviate the racial minority disparity in cervical cancer in the US,\" said Farley, who was not involved in the study but co-authored an editorial about the new findings in the journal Cancer on Monday.\n\n\"Those who get cancer, many times, do not have access to screening,\" he said. \n\nEven though cervical cancer mortality rates are higher than previously thought, Farley said that he thinks the current screening recommendations for cervical cancer are still adequate. However, he added, more women should have access to screenings and other preventive measures.\n\nRositch said, \"It may be that some women are not obtaining screening according to our current guidelines, not necessarily that guideline-based care is insufficient.\"\n\nHow to prevent and screen for cervical cancer\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends that women begin cervical cancer screenings at age 21 by having a Pap test every three years. Then, beginning at 30, women should have a Pap test combined with a HPV test every five years. However, the recommendations are not universal among all expert groups.\n\nSymptoms of cervical cancer tend to not appear until the cancer has advanced, which is why screening and HPV vaccinations are urged. \n\n\"We have a vaccine which can eliminate cervical cancer, like polio, that is currently available, and only 40% of girls age 13 to 17 have been vaccinated,\" said Farley, co-author of the editorial. \"This is an epic failure of our health care system in taking care of women in general and minorities specifically.\"\n\nWomen over 65 might not need to continue screening if they don't have a history of cervical cancer or negative Pap test results, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n\nEach year, about 38,793 new cases of cancer are found in parts of the body where HPV is often found. The virus has been linked not only to cervical cancer but to cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus or throat. \n\nA study published in the journal JAMA Oncology last week found that among a group of 1,868 men in the United States, about 45% had genital HPV infections and only about 10% had been vaccinated.\n\n\"Male HPV vaccination may have a greater effect on HPV transmission and cancer prevention in men and women than previously estimated,\" the researchers wrote in that study.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.063720226287839, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 888, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.90340353139, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.91441441441441, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/opinions/winston-churchill-bust-white-house/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "UK ambassador: Why Winston Churchill belongs in the Oval Office", "wordcount_as_scraped": 761, "date": "20170126150000", "story_content": "On Friday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May will lend a bust of Winston Churchill to President Donald Trump, which will stand in the Oval Office as a symbol of the strength of the relationship between the UK and the US. \n\nOne of the most famous Anglo-Americans in history, Churchill's presence will be a reminder of a friendship which has endured for generations, in both good times and bad.\n\nThere has been some confusion about this bust, and indeed some rumours that it has already been returned. In fact, there are two Churchill busts, both by British modernist sculptor, Sir Jacob Epstein, that have spent time in the White House.\n\nOne was a gift from the Wartime Friends of Winston Churchill and accepted by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. The second, owned by the UK Government Art Collection, was loaned by the British Government to President George W. Bush in 2001, while the first bust was being restored. \n\nAt the end of President Bush's Presidency in 2009, that second bust returned to the British Ambassador's Residence and the first bust -- fully restored -- was moved outside President Barack Obama's private study in the White House Residence. \n\nTomorrow, at the request of President Trump's team, the British Government will formally loan the second bust back, and it will resume its place in the Oval Office. \n\nIt is fitting, perhaps, that there are two busts of Winston Churchill in the White House, where many people had imagined there was only one. During his visits to the US, especially throughout the dark days of the Second World War, the man himself was a constant presence at the White House of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  \n\nOn his first visit, just two weeks after Pearl Harbor, he turned The Rose Suite into a British government headquarters away from home. The Monroe Room became a map room, with charts that tracked the course of the war. Reporting home, Churchill wrote, \"We live here as a big family in the greatest intimacy and informality, and I have formed the very highest regard and admiration for the President.\"\n\nIt was a tense time, full of uncertainty. Through those late nights and warm conversations, the bond between Roosevelt  and Churchill was forged, and the future of the special relationship secured. \n\nSo it is no surprise that just as the special relationship has endured, so has Churchill's presence. Over my first year as British Ambassador to the United States, I have found that Churchill -- the statesman, the commander, the orator, the wit -- is not only held in high regard at home, but equally so here.\n\nAs Eleanor Roosevelt noted, \"His speeches gave reassurance not only to the people of Great Britain, but to the people of the United States.\" And his legacy continues to live on here in the United States. \n\nIn 1965, Churchill became the first foreign head of government to be awarded honorary US citizenship. Today, in honour of his contributions, high schools, naval ships and even a mountain bear his name. And his likeness can be spotted in many places around Washington, from the Pentagon to the US Capitol.\n\nOver the years, Churchill also has remained a source of inspiration to many American presidents. \n\nPresident John F. Kennedy cited him when he accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for President in 1960. After his death, historians found that President Ronald Reagan kept a box of note cards with his favourite quotes by leaders, including Churchill. A favorite, used at the White House Correspondents Dinner in 1986: \"Courage is the one quality which guarantees all others.\" And just the other day, President Trump called Churchill a \"real ally.\"\n\nAs we look ahead to the future of the special relationship, we take our cues from the man who helped to forge it. In December 1941, just weeks after the United States entered the Second World War, the great Anglo-American, Winston Churchill, addressed Congress. When both the US and the UK faced such great challenges, he said:\n\n\"It is not given to us to peer into the mysteries of the future. Still, I avow my hope and faith, sure and inviolate, that in the days to come the British and American peoples will for their own safety and for the good of all walk together side by side in majesty, in justice, and in peace.\"\n\nAnd so Churchill, back in the Oval Office again, will continue to encourage the UK and the US to forge ever stronger bonds, not just for our shared history, but as much in expectation of our bright future ahead.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 3.2338309288024902, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 753, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.21282588612, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.24966799468791, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/obama-farewell-address/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1062, "scraper_regex": 1284}}, "headline": "Obama offers optimism -- and warnings -- in farewell address", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1284, "date": "20170111030000", "story_content": "Popular but politically humbled, President Barack Obama said goodbye to the nation Tuesday night, declaring during his farewell address that he hasn't abandoned his vision of progressive change but warning that it now comes with a new set of caveats.\n\nHis voice at moments catching with emotion, Obama recounted a presidency that saw setbacks as well as successes. Admitting candidly that political discourse has soured under his watch, Obama demanded that Americans renew efforts at reconciliation.\n\n\"It falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy,\" the President said. \"To embrace the joyous task we've been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours.\"\n\nObama also stressed solidarity despite a presidency sometimes at odds with Congress.\n\n\"Democracy does not require uniformity,\" Obama said. \"Our founders quarreled and compromised, and expected us to do the same. But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity -- the idea that for all our outward differences, we are all in this together; that we rise or fall as one.\"\n\nIn a concession that, for now, his brand of progressive politics is stalled in Washington, Obama admitted \"for every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back.\"\n\nHe implored his backers to be vigilant in protecting basic American values he warned could come under siege.\n\n\"Democracy can buckle when we give in to fear,\" he said. \"So just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are.\"\n\nAnd he warned against turning inward, telling Democrats that only by involving themselves in a real political discourse could they hope to renew the hopeful vision he brought to the White House eight years ago.\n\n\"After eight years as your President, I still believe that,\" he went on. \"And it's not just my belief. It's the beating heart of our American idea -- our bold experiment in self-government.\"\n\nPresident Obama farewell address: full text\n\nCapstone\n\nObama's speech is the capstone of a months-long farewell tour, manifested in extended magazine interviews, lengthy television sit-downs, and the White House's own efforts to document the President's waning administration. Through it all, Obama has sought to highlight the achievements of his presidency using statistics showing the country better off now than eight years ago. \n\nAs he spoke before a rowdy crowd of supporters, Obama was interrupted often with screams of \"I Love you Obama.\" When a protester holding a \"Pardon All of Us\" sign, chants of \"four more years\" drowned out the shouts.\n\nObama sought to corral his crowd, listing the accomplishments of the last eight years ranging from health care to marriage equality, all while insisting that his work isn't finished.\n\nHe recognized his successor Donald Trump, saying he was committed to a peaceful transition of power. But he warned that going forward Democrats shouldn't fall in line with their commander-in-chief.\n\nObama, who has addressed race with varying degrees of force during his time in office, used his farewell to insist Americans work harder to understand each other's struggles. After presiding over eight years that saw race relations enter a fraught new era, Obama demanded that differences be identified and reconciled.\n\n\"Brown kids will represent a larger share of America's workforce\" in the years ahead, Obama proclaimed, calling for better rules that will help the children of immigrants succeed.\n\nHe warned that \"laws alone won't be enough\" in resolving persistent differences between Americans.\n\n\"Hearts must change,\" he said.\n\nHe called on African-Americans and minorities to view with empathy \"the middle-aged white man who from the outside may seem like he's got all the advantages, but who's seen his world upended by economic, cultural, and technological change.\"\n\nWhere change never came: Obama's hometown\n\nAnd he urged whites to regard the protests of minorities as a fight \"not demanding special treatment, but the equal treatment our Founders promised.\"\n\n\"Regardless of the station we occupy, we have to try harder,\" Obama said. \"To start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do; that they value hard work and family like we do; that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own.\"\n\nCapitalize on goodwill\n\nIn coming to Chicago, Obama hoped to capitalize on a well of goodwill that's expanded in the final year of his tenure. He discarded the staid Oval Office or East Room for his last formal set of remarks, choosing instead the city where his political rise began and where he declared victory in 2008 and 2012.\n\nInside a vast convention hall packed with more than 20,000 of his most ardent supporters and former staffers, the mood was wistful. Ahead of his address, aides described the normally unsentimental commander in chief as nostalgic.\n\nOver the past several weeks, Obama has offered a rational view of Trump's election and rarely let on to any apprehension about his future as an ex-president. First lady Michelle Obama has articulated a more candid view in a scaled-back version of her own farewell. She sat for an hour-long interview with Oprah Winfrey, frankly admitting that Democrats were now \"feeling what not having hope feels like.\"\n\nAnd she became emotional during her final set of formal remarks at the White House Friday, her voice quaking and eyes welling with tears as she told a crowd of educators: \"I hope I made you proud.\"\n\nDuring his speech Tuesday, Obama voice quaked when describing his wife's service.\n\n\"You took on a role you didn't ask for and made it your own with grace and grit and style and good humor,\" he said. \"You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody.\"\n\nPlanning for months\n\nThe President had been planning his speech for months, aides said, formulating the broad themes while on vacation over the holidays in Hawaii and developing drafts starting last week.\n\nHe told aides months ago that he preferred to deliver his farewell address in his hometown, a first for a departing President. George W. Bush, unpopular and facing a financial crisis, delivered his final prime-time address in the White House East Room to a crowd of 200 supporters and aides.\n\nBill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter all used the Oval Office -- a setting Obama has long spurned for formal remarks. George H.W. Bush traveled outside of Washington to West Point for a departing address after failing to secure a second term, though he didn't actually bill it as a farewell.\n\nThe tradition extends back to George Washington, who issued warnings against unchecked power and partisan entrenchment in a written address to the nation in 1796.\n\nLike major addresses in the past, Obama wrote his speech himself, dictating passages to his chief speechwriter Cody Keenan who puts the President's words into print. Obama returned the drafts with heavy annotations, writing his changes in a tightly compressed scrawl on the margins.\n\nThe President and Keenan went through at least four drafts of the farewell speech, an official told CNN Tuesday. The broad themes of the speech came together while the President was in Hawaii and he started reading a first draft on the long flight home last Sunday.\n\nAside from Keenan, several familiar names from the past were involved in the drafting, including former speechwriter Jon Favreau and former senior adviser David Axelrod.\n\nWhen he returns to Washington in the early morning hours of Wednesday, it will be Obama's 1,293rd -- and final -- flight aboard Air Force One. He'll use the presidential aircraft on Inauguration Day to depart Washington. But with only a former president aboard, it's known simply as a \"Special Air Mission.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.17361110448837302, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1062, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.8462174184199993, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.63653483992467, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/us/post-election-glossary-trnd/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Your post-election glossary, from 'alt-right' to 'fake news'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 932, "date": "20161117040000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump's historic election was a lesson for those who relied on polls to tell them that Hillary Clinton's victory was a sure thing.\n\nNow, with Trump's transition to power underway, we're learning something new each day about the inner workings of politics, finance and culture. Here's our running glossary of terms to help keep you up to speed.\n\nWhite nationalism\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's selection of Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist brought a fringe term into the mainstream: white nationalism. \n\nIt's an umbrella term for a movement that espouses white domination but stops short of calling for the unrealistic goal of a 100% white society. Adherents say it promotes the interests of whites by focusing on white racial consciousness and white identity. \n\nActivists say white nationalism is little more than a euphemism for white supremacy that attempts to distance itself from traditional hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAlt-right\n\nBannon has called Breitbart News \"the platform for the alt-right,\" an ideological grouping associated with extreme conservative viewpoints and a rejection of mainstream politics. It has been linked to racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism.  \n\nMainline Republicans are too centrist for the alt-right, which rejects the conservative establishment and American multiculturalism. They oppose any level of immigration that would threaten white demographic dominance and despise \"political correctness.\" The alt-right is known for using online media to spread its message\n\nFake news\n\nFake news is basically what it sounds like: untrue or misleading stories on websites that appear legitimate. They are designed to be shared on Facebook and social media platforms whose algorithms prioritize stories with high engagement -- the amount of people clicking, reading and sharing -- with little regard for what they actually say. Also, there's perhaps no better way to ensure clicks than with incendiary or extreme headlines that confirm a reader's beliefs. In fact, a BuzzFeed News analysis found that top fake election news stories generated more total engagement on Facebook than top election stories from 19 major news outlets combined.\n\nAs CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter notes, there's a spectrum: total hoaxes, hyper-partisan and hybrids. The last of the three may be the most troubling, because they mix fact with fiction.\n\nPost-truth\n\nIt's the 2016 Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year so it's definitely a thing. Most often used in the context of politics, post-truth is an adjective that describes a political culture in which \"objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\" \n\nBelieved to have been popularized in the 2004 novel, \"The Post-truth Era,\" Oxford Dictionaries noted a spike in frequency this year in the context of the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom followed by the US presidential election. \n\nPress pool\n\nThere's been a lot of talk about how President-elect Trump has flouted convention by abandoning the press pool, the small group of journalists from different news organizations assigned to cover his movements.\n\nThe reason for the press pool is simple: Americans have a right to know about the president's whereabouts, particularly in a turbulent world. The reason we know what President George W. Bush was doing on the day of the September 11 attacks is because of the press pool.\n\n\"Questioning the necessity of press pool means questioning the public's right to know president/president elect's whereabouts, meetings, etc,\" Julie Pace of The Associated Press said on Twitter after Trump gave them the slip for the second time in one week.\n\nSanctuary campus\n\nTrump's pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants has led to protests on college campuses across the country with a specific aim: Pressure officials to make their school a sanctuary campus that limits cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\n\nSimilar to sanctuary cities, there's no established legal definition for what makes a city, county, state or school a sanctuary. Generally, though, jurisdictions that use the term have policies or laws that limit the extent to which law enforcement and other government employees will assist the federal government on immigration matters.\n\nSome ask universities to declare their support for undocumented students publicly. Others ask for more specific measures, such as guarantees the school won't release information on students' immigration status and that university police forces won't team up with the federal government in deportation raids. \n\nPEOTUS\n\nPOTUS, step aside. There's a new presidential acronym in town. \n\nPEOTUS stands for President-elect of the United States. As far as we can tell, it was not commonly used before this year. But with so much news on the presidential transition breaking first on social media, the acronym's useful for according President-elect Trump the respect of the office. \n\nBlind trust\n\nTrump has a stake in more than 500 privately held businesses around the world, leading to concerns of potential conflicts of interest as president. \n\nTrump has said he will sever those connections and have his children run the business, leading to questions of how he plans to do that.\n\nTrump's lawyer Michael Cohen said the assets would be placed into a blind trust. But lawyers and ethics experts say such an arrangement is impossible given the circumstances.\n\nFor one, a blind trust requires selling off assets and having an independent trustee oversee them so the president doesn't know where the money is invested. But Trump already knows where the money is and his children are far from independent trustees.\n\n\"Having your children run your trust does not discharge the conflicts of interest because the interests of your children, particularly in this case, are coexistensive with his self interests,\" said Kenneth Gross of international law firm Skadden Arps.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.33977627754211, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 888, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.67217062849, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161117040000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 2.9279279279279304, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/18/health/dalai-lama-guide-to-surviving-trump/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1084, "scraper_regex": 1199}}, "headline": "Dalai Lama: 5 things to keep in mind for the next four years ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1199, "date": "20170118160000", "story_content": "The Dalai Lama has some advice for anyone who is looking for happiness, no matter what their circumstances.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual and political leader of the Tibetan people in exile, spoke about the incoming administration in an interview with CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\n\nThe \"president, of course, (is a) very important individual, but basically I (am) always telling (people), the world belongs to humanity,\" said the Dalai Lama during the Emory-Tibet symposium of Scholars and Scientists held at the Drepung Monastic University in India in December.  \"Each nation belongs to the people,\" he said.\n\nIn other words, take comfort in the fact that our country is not run by a lone individual, albeit one that is incredibly powerful.\n\n\"America, I consider the leading nation of the free world,\" His Holiness said. \n\nIn an earlier interview he said he plans to meet with President-elect Trump after his inauguration and added that once in power, all presidents are forced to work with \"reality,\" and \"so I have no worries.\"\n\nAmerica will always keep an \"emphasis on liberty, democracy, rule of law,\" he said, and \"the people elected now have the responsibility\" to work together and will have to use \"team work,\" since \"America is a democracy and the power is divided.\"\n\nIf, however, someone's confidence in the country's checks and balances is still failing them, His Holiness has some additional advice to help you stay happy, no matter what happens in the world around you.\n\nYou do you\n\nFirst step, work on compassion and start by developing it for yourself. \n\n\"Mainly,\" he said, feeling happy is largely about \"your own mental attitude.\"\n\nIf you remain someone who is \"honest, truthful,\" about how you feel, you can find happiness \"no matter what (the) surrounding situation.\"\n\nHis Holiness is talking, in part, about the Buddhist concept of self-compassion. He believes we'd all be happier people if we learned more about our own selves and embraced who we are, flaws and all.\n\nWhen you have compassion for someone, typically that means you are recognizing and validating someone's pain. \n\nPsychologists have shown when you do that, you automatically develop feelings of kindness and caring for that person. You develop concern for their general well-being.\n\nSelf-compassion, then, is when you are kind, rather than critical, toward yourself, even when you mess up or when you are in some form of emotional pain. \n\nDon't confuse this with self-pity, when you dwell on that pain. Instead, it's when \"in instances of pain or failure, rather than being harshly self-critical; perceiving one's experiences as part of the larger human experience rather than seeing them as isolating; and holding painful thoughts and feelings in mindful awareness rather than over-identifying with them,\" writes  scholar Kristin Neff in Self-Compassion and Pscyhological Well-Being. \n\nNeff is an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin's department of educational psychology and an expert on self-compassion.\n\n\"Most people have much more compassion for others than themselves,\" Neff said.\n\nIf you can develop a compassion toward yourself, it is easier to feel compassion toward others \"and is much more sustainable,\" Neff said.\n\nAnd the Dalai Lama believes that with less self-criticism, your \"health will be much better.\" Many studies back that up.\n\nTake time to think\n\nIt's a lot easier to feel compassion if you take the time to reflect on what you're experiencing. The Dalai Lama, for instance, gets up at 3am to meditate five hours a day.\n\nYou probably don't have that much time, but even 10 minutes of meditation has been shown to help your thought process. Meditation can physically change the parts of the brain that help you better handle stress and increase your feelings of empathy, studies show. \n\nLonger meditation sessions, even 20 minutes, can improve your mood, your attention span and memory.\n\nThinking more deeply, you start to realize, His Holiness said, that \"nothing exists as (it) appears.\" \n\nTake the time to put your feelings in context, he said, \"then the very basis of these negative emotions becomes thinner, thinner, thinner.\"\n\nAnger be gone\n\nIf you do feel angry about the election, or any other circumstance, don't let it dominate your thoughts. Constant anger can lead to depression, insomnia, overeating,  heart problems, strokes and early death, studies show.\n\n\"Constant anger is very bad for our health,\" His Holiness said. \"I try to keep compassion\" constantly in mind and then stay \"surrounded by (other) compassionate people\" that can reduce your anger. Do that and your health will be \"much better.\"\n\nA lot of negative thought is rooted in perception, studies show, but that doesn't have to mean you become a Pollyanna about negative experiences. \"If a glass is half full, you can't pretend it's full,\" Neff said. \"If you can think about wrapping your suffering and anger in a kind of care and compassion and concern, it can activate the reward center of the brain.\" \n\nWorking with Tibetan teachers over the years, she said, she has been impressed that despite their difficult circumstances of having to flee their country and live as refugees, as the Dalai Lama has since 1959, many people seem to be happy. \"It is not like they deny their suffering, they are open to it, but they hold those feelings with love and compassion,\" she said.\n\nHelp others\n\nAnother key to happiness, His Holiness suggests, is to \"try to be of some service to others.\" If you can help others, then \"no matter what (the) surrounding situation, you can keep (up your) self-confidence and happiness.\"\n\nService can come in the form of volunteering, like at a soup kitchen, or on a candidate's campaign, but it can also be simpler, like being a good listener when people are upset.\n\nVolunteers feel more socially connected, they're less lonely, and suffer from depression less, studies show. Volunteering creates physical benefits too: Regular volunteers are less likely to develop high blood pressure and live longer, some studies show.\n\nSimple acts like being a good listener can also reduce your own feelings of stress and improve your feelings of well-being, other studies show. \n\nAct like a kid\n\nFinally, be playful and childlike. Children, the Dalai Lama said are \"very honest\" and often accept people without judgment.\n\n\"They don't care what's their religion, what's their nationality, they don't care what sort of family background\" they have, he said. \"Basic human nature is compassionate.\"\n\nWhile competition and materialism can encourage those feelings to go \"dormant,\" he said, playfulness can bring those feelings back.\n\nHis Holiness is constantly laughing and he's playful even when he speaks about such serious subjects. \n\nStudies back up his advice, showing that adults who are playful have more positive relationships and better life satisfaction. They also tend to be healthier and experience less anxiety.\n\nConsidering this advice could make a real difference to how you experience the next few years.\n\n\"I will always feel there is real hope we can do something. So no matter (what the) difficult circumstances, it is really worthwhile,\" the Dalai Lama said.\n\n\"Make (an) effort (and) once you committed effort, even small effort results will come,\" the Dalai Lama said. \"You get tremendous sort of satisfaction and then feel happy.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.12591981887817, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1084, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.4275620588699995, "HarmVirtue": 16, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 7, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 46, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170118160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.24354243542435, "mft_mean": 4.18181818182}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/how-the-trump-administration-chose-the-7-countries/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 589, "scraper_regex": 666}}, "headline": "How the Trump administration chose the 7 countries in the immigration executive order", "wordcount_as_scraped": 666, "date": "20170129220000", "story_content": "The seven Muslim-majority countries targeted in President Trump's executive order on immigration were initially identified as \"countries of concern\" under the Obama administration. \n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Sunday pointed to the Obama administration's actions as the basis for their selection of the seven countries. Trump's order bars citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the U.S. for the next 90 days. \n\n\"There were further travel restrictions already in place from those seven countries,\" Spicer said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \n\n\"What the president did was take the first step through this executive order of ensuring that we're looking at the entire system of who's coming in, refugees that are coming in, people who are coming in from places that have a history or that our intelligence suggests that we need to have further extreme vetting for.\"\n\nRestrictions from Obama years broadened to a ban\n\nIn December 2015, President Obama signed into law a measure placing limited restrictions on certain travelers who had visited Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria on or after March 1, 2011. Two months later, the Obama administration added Libya, Somalia, and Yemen to the list, in what it called an effort to address \"the growing threat from foreign terrorist fighters.\"\n\nThe restrictions specifically limited what is known as visa-waiver travel by those who had visited one of the seven countries within the specified time period. People who previously could have entered the United States without a visa were instead required to apply for one if they had traveled to one of the seven countries.\n\nUnder the law, dual citizens of visa-waiver countries and Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria could no longer travel to the U.S. without a visa. Dual citizens of Libya, Somalia, and Yemen could, however, still use the visa-waiver program if they hadn't traveled to any of the seven countries after March 2011. \n\nTrump's order is much broader. It bans all citizens from those seven countries from entering the U.S. and leaves green card holders subject to being rescreened after visiting those countries. \n\nThe executive order specifically invoked the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. A senior Trump administration official also pointed to the 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, to justify the President's orders although neither of the attackers in the shooting would've been affected by the new ban. \n\nConflict of interest questions\n\nIn the hours after its release, many questioned why the list omitted other countries with direct links to those terror attacks. The 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon.\n\nSome also questioned whether Trump deliberately left off countries where he has business interests. \n\nThe list does not include Muslim-majority countries where the Trump Organization does business, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. In financial disclosure forms during the presidential campaign, he listed two companies with dealings in Egypt and eight with business in Saudi Arabia. And in the UAE, the Trump Organization is partnering with a local billionaire to develop two golf courses in Dubai.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Sunday Trump's business ties had no influence over the countries selected for the travel ban. \n\n\"Just like I said very clearly, the countries that were chosen in the executive order to protect Americans from terrorists were the countries that have already been identified by Congress and the Obama administration,\" Priebus said on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nHe added, \"That does not mean that other countries wouldn't be added later to a subsequent executive order.\"\n\nEthics lawyers say the correlation illustrates the conflict of interest Trump has created by keeping an ownership stake in his business.\n\n\"Somalia is on the list, but Saudi Arabia is not. People from Somalia are going to say that's arbitrary. And one of the factors, people are going to say, is the president does business with Saudi Arabia but not Somalia,\" said Richard Painter, the chief ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.91858673095703, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 589, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.05595205709, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170129220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.584040747028861, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/18/politics/trump-inauguration-security-protests-numbers/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 612, "scraper_regex": 660}}, "headline": "Donald Trump's inauguration security, by the numbers", "wordcount_as_scraped": 660, "date": "20170118150000", "story_content": "The full force of the US domestic security apparatus will be deployed to stand guard as President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of office Friday, with an estimated 900,000 people expected to gather in Washington for the inauguration and related activities.\n\nMore than 100 square blocks -- about 2.7 square miles -- will be closed to automobile traffic as federal, state and local authorities create a protective bubble around the swearing-in ceremony, presidential festivities and opposition protests. The final tab is expected to surpass $100 million. \n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said last week at a briefing from a suburban command and control center that an estimated 28,000 in personnel from the US Secret Service, Transportation Security Administration, FBI, US Park Police, US Capitol Police, Coast Guard and local police from Washington and around the nation would be fanned out across the city to provide multiple layers -- and dimensions -- of security.\n\nLone wolf threat is DHS focus as 99 groups plan pro- and anti-Trump rallies\n\nDespite the absence of a \"specific, credible threat,\" Johnson told reporters the primary focus would be on \"individual acts of violent extremism and those who self-radicalize,\" as have been seen in recent attacks in France and Germany. Dump trucks and buses will be placed in strategic locations to block off large gatherings of pedestrians. \n\nJohnson also estimated that a total of 99 both pro- and anti-Trump groups -- their plans gleaned via permit applications and social media surveillance -- would launch demonstrations over a period beginning Friday and carrying on through Saturday evening. \n\nThe Women's March on Washington, which is drawing a vast coalition of anti-Trump groups, could draw upwards of 200,000 people on Saturday. Unseasonably warm temperatures are being forecast -- 51 degrees with evening showers on Friday and a high of 61 degrees on Saturday -- and should help groups reach their more optimistic turnout estimates.\n\nWhat you can't bring -- from guns to drums \n\nTicketholders for the inaugural ceremony, which will take place at the foot of the Capitol, can enter through six public security checkpoints flanking the National Mall and Reflecting Pool. Restrictions there will be even more exacting, with officials publishing a list of no fewer than 40 banned items, including everything from firearms and fireworks to backpacks, balloons, drums, whistles and selfie sticks. \n\nOne thing police will not be prioritizing, according to Washington Mayor Mayor Muriel Bowser, are the 4,200 free joints being handed out by a marijuana activist group. The district legalized marijuana for recreational use in 2015. Possession of up to two ounces is permitted, as is growing and giving it away for free. DCMJ will begin its green handout on Friday morning and is calling on demonstrators to light up -- which, in public, is not legal -- four minutes and twenty seconds into Trump's speech.\n\nThe city is on the hook for $30 million in spending, the mayor said at a recent press conference, with $19 million expected to be reimbursed directly by Congress. A portion of the $90 million the inaugural committee said it raised in the run-up will also go to cover security costs.\n\nFlight and rail restrictions speed up as ceremonies near\n\nAirspace restrictions over the capital will also be tightened over the coming days. The Federal Aviation Administration will modify its typical parameters and limit local airport procedures from 1:30 p.m. ET to 6:30 p.m. on Thursday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Friday and for three hours, from 9 a.m. to noon, on Saturday.\n\nAmong the items banned from the inaugural secure zones are small drone devices. Johnson said security officials will be keeping close tabs on the remote control flyers, which can elude radar and twice breached the White House perimeter in 2015.  \n\n\"It is something we have planned for, and there is technology to deal with it,\" Johnson said.  \n\nAnticipating a flood of visitors, Amtrak too will ramp up rail security efforts with enhanced patrols and additional K-9 units monitoring passengers and their carry-on and checked baggage.

Wells' novel \"The War of the Worlds,\" about Martians invading the Earth. Directed by a young genius named Orson Welles, the radio drama was presented as actual news coverage of an invasion from outer space. Many listeners across the nation swallowed it whole. Genuinely terrified, they flooded police departments with panicked calls. \n\nThe story was fictional, but the fear it produced was real. We laugh at this today, or appreciate its artistry as satire. The \"Greatest Generation\" may have been great -- but they were awfully gullible, too! We're much more media savvy than our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents ... or not. Look no further than the phenomenon of fake news -- false stories reported on the Internet and often amplified by social media. As someone who has spent a career in law enforcement, I can say without hesitation that fake news -- producing it and sharing it -- constitutes a very real threat to public safety. \n\nFake news can ruin reputations, lives, and careers. It can wreck businesses. It can be used to terrorize individuals, public officials, or anybody somebody doesn't like. It can influence elections. Fake news can even contribute to shaping decisions made by leaders of companies, institutions, government agencies, and the government itself. Fake news can kill.\n\nOn December 5, fake news propelled 28-year-old Edgar M. Welch as he drove from his home in Salisbury, North Carolina, to Washington, D.C. At 3 p.m., he walked into Comet Ping Pong, a popular pizzeria in the northwest quadrant of the nation's capital carrying a rifle. Some sources say he pointed it at a restaurant employee, but all that is known for certain is that he fired it. Whether he intended to kill, he thankfully hit no one. Police responded, and while much of the neighborhood was locked down, heavily armed officers took Welch into custody.\n\nIt is only by the grace of God that the rifle round fired by Welch found no human target in the busy family restaurant he invaded. But we have been warned: Fake news can trigger real bullets.\n\nWelch told police that he was on a mission to \"self-investigate\" a news story posted on Facebook and on websites including The New Nationalist and The Vigilant Citizen under headlines like this: \"Pizzagate: How 4Chan Uncovered the Sick World of Washington's Occult Elite.\" Appearing in variations across the Internet shortly before the presidential election, \"pizzagate\" consisted of dozens of online news \"reports\" that Hillary Clinton was the mastermind of a criminal ring that kidnapped children, using the backroom of Comet Ping Pong to \"molest and traffic\" them. These stories sent Welch to the pizzeria to \"self-investigate\" -- with his rifle. \n\nHe was not alone in having taken the stories with dead seriousness. James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong, had been receiving \"hundreds of death threats ... via texts, Facebook and Twitter,\" all alleging that his restaurant \"was the home base of a child abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief, John D. Podesta.\" Many of Alefantis' employees were also being barraged with similar online accusations and threats.\n\nIt is obvious to assume that Welch suffers from some delusional disorder. Yet, as I say, he was -- and is -- not alone in giving credence to stories that Clinton -- the former first lady, US senator, secretary of state, and presidential candidate -- partnered with her campaign chairman, the former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and counselor to President Barack Obama, in a child sex trafficking enterprise headquartered in the backroom of a DC pizza parlor. No less a figure than Michael G. Flynn, the son of retired US Army Lt. Gen.  Michael T. (Mike) Flynn, whom President-elect Donald Trump has named as his national security adviser, tweeted on December 4: \"Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many 'coincidences' tied to it.\" A few days later, the younger Flynn left the transition team, though Trump officials would not explain why. \n\nA month earlier, on November 2, Lt. Gen. Flynn himself had tweeted \"U decide -- NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes w Children, etc ... MUST READ!\" The only trouble here is that the NYPD blew no such whistle. As reported by Politico, the retweeted \"news\" is fake, as were Lt. Gen. Flynn's retweeted stories that Hillary Clinton \"secretly waged war\" on the Catholic Church and that President Obama is a \"jihadi\" who \"laundered\" money for Muslim terrorists. (It was Obama who appointed Flynn in 2012 as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency). Lt. Gen. Flynn currently has 106,000 Twitter followers.\n\nFake news is unquestionably an industry, and a growth industry to boot. \"How much money can you bring in by making stuff up and putting it on the Internet?\" the Washington Post asked Paul Horner, \"a prolific, Facebook-focused fake-news writer. \"I make like $10,000 a month from AdSense (a company that sells advertising placement on websites),\" Horner answered. The Post went on to report that \"among a growing group of Macedonian teenagers who see fake-news sites as a way to make easy money from American gullibility, the most successful can make about $5,000 a month ...\" \n\nI would argue, however, that regardless of its profits, fake news' stock-in-trade is terrorism. We are all too familiar with the way ISIS uses the Internet to incite collective and individual acts of terrorism in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. The ISIS online strategy is to win recruits by undermining local national allegiances, loyalties, and values, and to destroy faith in government. This is also precisely the effect of fake news. And that makes fake news a form of domestic terrorism. \n\nThe First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, of the press, and of peaceful assembly, all rights indispensable to democracy, makes it difficult for government and law enforcement to combat fake news. I am greatly heartened by the December 5 announcement by a coalition among Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft \"that they have teamed up to fight the spread of terrorist content over the web by sharing technology and information to reduce the flow of terrorist propaganda across their services.\" Welcome to the fight, I say. I only hope that these and other tech companies will recognize fake news -- deliberate disinformation intended to do harm -- as terrorist propaganda. \n\nIn the meantime, it is up to us, the stakeholders in the world's greatest democracy, not to believe the Martians are invading just because the Internet tells us they are. Media of all kinds is vital to our freedom. In a 1787 letter to the Virginia statesman Edward Carrington, Thomas Jefferson wrote, \"Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.\" Strong words, good words, and I agree with them. But each of us, whether we are a parent, teacher, police officer, or presidential adviser, needs to do three things, without exception, before sharing a story on social media. Consider the source. Weigh the source.

There's actually quite a few pieces of good news today. So keep reading. Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.\n\n1. Trump administration\n\nDonald Trump's almost laser-focused on keeping his campaign promises, and today he'll sign an executive order to get going on his biggest: building a wall on the Mexican border. So, is Mexico going to pay for it? Well, Trump's going to ask for an accounting of how much aid the US is sending to Mexico - and some of that money could eventually go to fund the construction. See? Math! Yesterday, Trump took a big step to keep another promise by OK'ing work on the controversial DAPL and Keystone pipelines. Want to keep up with how well he's doing with all of his promises? We put together a handy-dandy Trump Promises Tracker. You're very welcome. BTW, Mr. President, you may want to add this on your to-do list for today: please change your Twitter security settings! A hacker said it would be a pretty good idea. \n\n2. Good news\n\nCancer deaths are down quite a bit in the US. About 20% since 1980. That's great news - although a new study says there are some places, primarily in the South, where we've seen stubborn cancer clusters. So we still have a ways to go. In more good news, the lead levels in the water in Flint, Michigan, have tested below the federal limits. That's a first in a couple of years. \n\n3. Israel\n\nIsrael's really happy with the Trump administration. There's so much love right now that Israel felt confident enough to OK the construction of 2,500 new housing units in West Bank settlements. Why is this noteworthy? Because the Obama administration was against it and the UN calls it a \"flagrant violation under international law.\" You see, the notion of a \"two-state solution\" has long been central to the tortuous Middle East peace process. It envisions a Palestinian state existing alongside Israel. But many observers worry that Israel's continued settlement building makes the physical reality of a Palestinian state ever less possible.\n\n4. Syrian civil war\n\nQuestion: Do you really have a peace agreement if neither of the fighting parties sign it? The latest Syrian peace talks are over in Kazakhstan, and it produced an agreement from Russia, Turkey and Iran that basically said they'd work to maintain the ceasefire that went into effect last month. That's nice, but neither the Syrian government or rebel groups signed it. The two wouldn't even meet face to face. So what's next? More talks next month.\n\n5. Oscars\n\nThe Oscar nominations are out, and seven actors of color snagged nominations. So is it time to retire the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag? (The creator of the hashtag says, um, no). \"La La Land,\" the can't-do-wrong musical, danced away with 14 nods, tying it with Hollywood classics \"All About Eve\" and \"Titanic.\" But our favorite moment was Meryl Streep's reaction to her nomination (She sent in a GIF!). Here's the complete list, so you're ready when the winners are announced on February 26.\n\n        \n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nPeople are talking about these. Read up. Join in.\n\nHide and seek\n\nIf you have $20 million in cash you need to hide, it's best to put it someplace where no one would ever think to look for it. Like your mattress.\n\nDifferent strokes\n\nShe's black. She's white. And they're twins. No, it's not some far-fetched television sitcom. It's genetics.\n\nHis cross to bear\n\nHe plans to build a wooden cross for every person killed in Chicago's violence this year. The sad part is he's already built 40 this month.\n\nOpen mouth, insert foot\n\nShe said on Facebook she wouldn't defend President Trump from a bullet, which is a really dumb thing to say if you're a Secret Service agent.\n\nHelp wanted\n\nCards Against Humanity wants a new CEO. Very specific requirements. The only person who could fill the job just left his last one -- at the White House\n\nAND FINALLY ...\n\nDynamic duet\n\nGo ahead and get ready to feel all the feels as this 4-year-old girl and her dad rock the song \"You've Got a Friend in Me.\" (Click to view)", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.960219502449036, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 647, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.77214442633, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.7820710973724903, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/asia/indonesia-australia-army/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Australia and Indonesia: A relationship too important to fail?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 682, "date": "20170105130000", "story_content": "The sudden bust-up, and equally quick detente, between Australia and Indonesia over the past few days shows just how delicate -- and crucial -- the relationship between the two neighbors is. \n\nIndonesia suspended all military cooperation with Australia last month after taking offense over an incident at a joint military training facility. \n\nThere was a twist in the tale however -- Australia made a public apology on Thursday and Indonesia accepted it the very same day, downplaying a spat that had earlier seemed to have severe, and potentially long-lasting, repercussions. \n\nThe grace displayed by both nations mended what could have been a very damaging rift. \n\nNatali Sambhi, a research fellow who focuses on Indonesian defense and security at the Perth USAsia Center, tells CNN the defense cooperation between the two countries is mutually beneficial to both militaries.\n\nShe adds that there are a number of security challenges, including people smuggling and terrorism, where working together is more fruitful than working alone.\n\n\"Military exercises and exchanges also help build good working relationships between personnel, which can help open vital channels of communication during times of crisis,\" she says.\n\nMathew Davies, the head of the International Relations Department at The Australian National University, says Australia views its relationship with Indonesia as \"centrally important\", and warns the connection is still \"delicate\".\n\n\"Without Indonesia, all of Australia's key partner states are a long way away.\"\n\n\"A strong relationship helps Australia feel 'part of the region' -- ensuring that Australian interests are listened to and respected, and that Australia is not isolated.\"\n\nIndo-Australian relations had been warming prior to the recent kerfuffle; Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's leadership led to a thaw with Indonesian President Joko Widodo after a tumultuous few years of relations with Tony Abbott.\n\nHowever, Davies says there remain strong sensitivities on both sides, especially regarding the issue of mutual respect. \n\n\"The continued sensitivity of the Indonesian military illustrates just how hard it is to build lasting trust between the two sides,\" he adds.\n\nOffense too 'hurtful' to describe\n\nThe military misunderstanding between the neighbors was sparked off when an Indonesian special forces instructor found documents insulting the Pancasila, Indonesia's national philosophy, at a joint training camp.\n\nIndonesian Armed Forces commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo said the documents questioned Indonesia's sovereignty on West Papua and were offensive about Indonesian soldiers who served in East Timor.\n\nWhen asked about the exact contents of the offending material, he refused to elaborate, saying it was \"too hurtful\" to say.\n\nHe said he wanted a personal apology from Australia's army chief.\n\n\"Why should I go to Australia?\" he said. \"It should be the other way around.\"\n\nWhatever they were, the offensive materials led to Indonesia suspending \"defense cooperation,\" a stance that changed when Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne expressed regret for any offense caused. \n\nAt a press conference Thursday, she promised the offending material had \"most certainly\" been removed and that it would be replaced by appropriate material.\n\nHer Indonesian counterpart, Ryamizard Ryacudu, accepted her apology.\n\n\"Something like this should never happen, because as friendly countries, we are not supposed to let this kind of incident ruin our friendship,\" he said.\n\nHe added the only halt in joint activities was in language training, while a \"complete investigation\" is done. \n\nJoko himself addressed the issue on Thursday, saying the situation had to be dealt with so it didn't get any \"hotter.\" \n\n\"I think our relationship with Australia is still in a good condition,\" he added.\n\nA long and tempestuous relationship\n\nThe occasionally rocky relationship between Australia and Indonesia has steadily improved since the late 1990s, when Australia led an international peacekeeping task force into the then Indonesian territory of East Timor.\n\nCooperation between the two nations was spurred on by joint security efforts to fight regional terrorism in the wake of the 2002 Bali bombings and subsequent attacks in Jakarta, including the bombing of the Australian Embassy there.\n\nIn 2009, it was revealed that Australian intelligence attempted to tap the mobile phone of then-president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.

They say they plan to retain some of the most popular planks of the law, such as barring insurers from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions and allowing those who want to remain on their parents' health care plans until age 26.  \n\nBut Pelosi argued that the practical effect of leaving those provisions in place and peeling away the other parts of the law won't work because of the costs.\n\n\"You can't keep them. You can't afford them because the cost would be so astronomical,\" Pelosi said, noting the motivation for creating the system was to address the spiraling costs of medical care.

Everybody is healthier the more people that are in the pool.\"\n\n\"They say they're going to keep 'this, this and this,' and they'll find out that they will do it as at a cost to the policy holder,\" she said of Republicans' intentions, stressing that \"cost to the policyholder is one of the thing that they are sensitive to.\"\n\nThe House minority leader said there have been no discussions to date with GOP leaders about their plans to overhaul the law, but said there could be some collaboration.\n\n\"We know that there were many compromises made to pass the Affordable Care Act.

They're rapists.\"  \n\nAlmost 18 months later, a poll published just before the election showed that the anger had barely eased; it found that 76% of Mexicans had a bad or very bad impression of Trump. \n\nAnd it wasn't just individual Mexicans who were worried. As the US results started to come in, and as it became clear that Hillary Clinton would probably lose, the value of the Mexican peso plunged close to 15%. \n\nNone of this is surprising. Donald Trump has brilliantly woven together the fear of \"illegals\" with other issues like crime, drugs, unemployment, low growth and even terrorism. In the process, he has made Mexico into the perfect scapegoat. And having put this theme at the center of his campaign, it is difficult to see how Trump will be able to back away from his proposals. Will he still try to build a wall? How would he pay for it? By going after remittances? Will he follow through on his pledges on deportation?\n\nThese are the types of questions that Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is now wrestling with. His problem, though, is twofold: How do you negotiate with one of the people whom Mexicans despise most? And how do you do so when your credibility and popularity have plunged with your own people? (Mexicans have not forgiven Pe\u00f1a Nieto for inviting Trump for a visit in August). Pe\u00f1a Nieto has very few tools to defend the rights of millions of Mexicans who could be deported back to Mexico, which has only increased the anger toward the President. \n\nThe one issue where Pe\u00f1a Nieto might have some influence over Trump is on any negotiations on the North American Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, especially once Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is included in discussions.  \n\nClearly, Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Trudeau could never have imagined that at the next North American \"three amigos\" meeting they would be joined by global trade destroyer Donald Trump. But one lesson that can be taken from Hillary Clinton's loss is that there is an underlying, and extraordinarily strong, rejection of trade agreements among many Americans. Indeed, Clinton's stance on NAFTA (although timid compared with Bill Clinton when he was in office) may have contributed to losses in Michigan and Pennsylvania.  \n\nThe other trade agreement attacked by Trump during his campaign, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, was pretty much declared dead by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and the Senate will not move forward with the ratification of this 12 nations agreement. This means NAFTA is pretty much the only trade agreement left that President Trump will be able to give \"The Art of the Deal\" treatment. And that might be disastrous for Mexico, Canada AND the United States.\n\nWill America walk away from the 2-decade-old NAFTA? It seems almost impossible to imagine; the cost in growth and jobs for both nations would simply be too high. For example, a study by the Mexico Center at the Woodrow Wilson Institute noted some half-trillion dollars in goods and services each year between both countries, \"which amounts to more than a million dollars in bilateral commerce every minute.\" It also suggested that should the United States ditch NAFTA, it could mean the loss of some 5 million US jobs that depend on trade with Mexico. \n\nRelations between Pe\u00f1a Nieto and the incoming US president at least got off to a good start, with the former congratulating President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday, just hours after Clinton had conceded. \n\nAccording to Pe\u00f1a Nieto, they spoke about security, cooperation and prosperity. That they talked about security is no surprise -- the uptick in violence in Mexico, as well as trafficking of heroin to the United States, will be a priority issue for both the United States and Mexico in the coming months. But the truth is that by the time Trump has picked his Mexico/Latin American policy team, and negotiations start to dismantle NAFTA, Pe\u00f1a Nieto will already be approaching lame duck territory, with a presidential election to take place in Mexico in 2018.  \n\nAlso on the economic front, Trump threatened US companies like Ford that build vehicles in Mexico with a 35% tax. \"When that [Ford] car comes back across the border into our country that now comes in free, we're gonna charge them a 35% tax. And you know what's gonna happen, they're never going to leave,\" he said.\n\nThe irony with such comments is that Mexico will now have to find ways to defend and support US companies from their government, if they have intentions or investments in Mexico. \n\nBut there is a potential wild card in all this. The populist, anti-establishment Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is seen as a leading contender for Mexico's presidency. He may see a populist Trump presidency as providing an opening for his candidacy.  And if he is successful, we could see a meeting between a President Donald Trump and a President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador that would raise almost as many eyebrows here in Mexico as Trump's extraordinary win did across the border.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.51802659034729, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 949, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.60324019332, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161115000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 2.7397260273972597, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/15/politics/obama-race-interviews/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "On farewell interview tour, Obama gets candid on race", "wordcount_as_scraped": 756, "date": "20161215120000", "story_content": "President Barack Obama, heading toward the exit, is working to punctuate his record on race.\n\nHe told Trevor Noah on \"The Daily Show\" that the country has \"by no means overcome the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow and colonialism and racism.\"\n\nSpeaking to Ta-Nehisi Coates for an Atlantic magazine cover, Obama said he \"never doubted ... my ability to get white support\" during his two presidential campaigns.\n\nAnd talking with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, he alleged some of his opponents were \"absolutely\" feeding off bias.\n\nPreparing to depart office, Obama is undergoing a farewell tour of interviews, many focused on his experience and legacy as the nation's first African-American president.\n\nIt's a topic he's grown more comfortable discussing candidly as his term winds to a close. And it's one that's only gained more prominence since Donald Trump -- who flamed the racially tinged birther theory -- was elected President.\n\nObama hopes to provide a positive summation of his time in office while acknowledging centuries-old racial tension was never going to be resolved by his historic election.\n\nIt's not the only area he's looking to tie up before he departs in January. He delivered a final assessment of his foreign policy during a visit to the Florida headquarters of US Special Command last week. And officials say a formal farewell speech is likely when Obama returns from his winter vacation in Hawaii next month.\n\nBut in his recent interviews -- lengthier than his normal sit-downs -- Obama has focused more heavily on race, an issue that was always going to feature prominently in his legacy.\n\nOn \"The Daily Show,\" Obama tried to explain how he spoke publicly about the issue, balancing a need to delve honestly into problems without inflaming tensions.\n\n\"If I'm communicating my genuine belief that those who are not subject to racism can sometimes have blind spots or lack appreciation of what it feels to be on the receiving end of that ... I always felt that if I really knew that and I just communicated it as clearly as I could, that I'd be OK,\" he said.\n\nThat approach hasn't always pleased black activists and leaders, some venting frustration Obama wasn't saying enough to support their point of view. Some prominent African-Americans even accused Obama of being overly harsh in his assessments of why their communities were lagging behind in graduation rates and unemployment.\n\nAnd he's been rebuffed, at times, by members of the Black Lives Matter movement that sprung from repeated incidents of police brutality that transpired while he was president.\n\n\"That sort of lack of awareness on the part of an activist about the constraints of our political system and the constraints on this office, I think, sometimes would leave me to mutter under my breath. Very rarely did I lose it publicly. Usually I'd just smile,\" Obama told Coates, who himself has been critical of some of the President's approaches on racial issues.\n\n\"The reason I say that is because those are the times where sometimes you feel actually a little bit hurt,\" Obama said, a rare admission of how personal some of the criticism directed toward him became.\n\nFor Obama, issues of race are inherently personal in ways that they weren't for his predecessors. He entered office confronting outsized expectations for advancing racial progress but also, in the eyes of certain allies, a strain of inherent racial bias against his agenda.\n\n\"I think there's a reason why attitudes about my presidency among whites in Northern states are very different from whites in Southern states,\" Obama told Zakaria in a CNN special report. \"Are there folks whose primary concern about me has been that I seem foreign, the other? Are those who champion the 'birther' movement feeding off of bias? Absolutely.\"\n\nIn his attempts to push the country toward greater equality, it's often Obama's personal message -- his story and his success -- that's held the most impact.\n\nAt the White House Wednesday, the young man who introduced Obama at a mentorship summit, Malachi Hernandez, said Obama had inspired him after a roundtable meeting last year to reconnect with his own father.\n\nStanding in front of seven participants in his My Brother's Keeper program, Obama emphasized again that issues of racial disparity were personal for him.\n\n\"I see myself in these young people,\" Obama said in his remarks. \"I grew up without a father. There were times when I made poor choices, times where I was adrift. The only difference between me and a lot of other young men is that I grew up in a forgiving environment.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.52206802368164, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 738, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.14991914915, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215120000, "FairnessVice": 3, "pct_mft_words": 2.03252032520325, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/19/health/empathy-no-good-card-for-this/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1002, "scraper_regex": 1126}}, "headline": "'There is no good card for this': What to say and do when bad things happen", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1126, "date": "20170119100000", "story_content": "When Emily McDowell was battling Hodgkin's lymphoma 15 years ago, she got sick during chemotherapy, lost her hair and was called \"sir\" by Starbucks baristas. \n\nBut the worst part was the loneliness. \n\nHer friends and family didn't know what to say, or said the wrong thing, and many of them simply disappeared. And then there were the sympathy cards. \n\nFrom the perspective of someone receiving and buying cards, McDowell found herself put off by the categories: religious, weird jokes or impersonally stating \"with sympathy\" next to a depiction of flowers.\n\n\"When you get sick or lose someone, your identity by default becomes 'sick person' or 'someone who lost someone,' \" McDowell said. \"In many, many ways, you are the same person you were before your diagnosis or before this thing happened. \n\nYou still appreciate humor, you are still a whole person. There wasn't really anything in greeting card world that allowed for that.\"\n\nAfter McDowell's cancer went into remission, she discovered a passion for creating her business Empathy Cards, \"cards for the relationships we really have.\" \n\nThe open, conversational tone of the cards and their unique illustrations connected with people. McDowell's business grew and she received thousands of responses. It made her realize that there was more to be done. \n\nShe wanted to create an approachable book that picked up where the cards left off by continuing the conversation around empathy, but McDowell also wanted it to be research-based.\n\n\"We just don't know what to say as a culture. It's not something we are taught,\" McDowell said. \"People are terrified of saying the wrong thing or making it worse or feeling awkward, and awkwardness is scary for people. \n\nI wanted to make a book that was attractive to people who would be scared off by a self-help book.\"\n\nA mutual friend told her about Kelsey Crowe, a fellow cancer survivor and empathy expert who founded Help Each Other Out, an organizer of empathy bootcamp workshops that help people learn to be supportive and navigate tough times. And Crowe had been accumulating research for years that she wanted to put in a book, but she also wanted it to be illustrated. \n\n\"I wanted the tone of this book to be super friendly and relatable and even light so people aren't turned off by it because it's such a heavy topic,\" Crowe said. \"Encountering Emily's work, it seemed like such a good pairing of mindsets about how to make people feel comfortable with the awkwardness of this situation, which is being there in times of suffering.\"\n\nThe result is their coauthored illustrated guide, \"There is No Good Card For This: What to Say and Do When Life is Scary, Awful and Unfair to People You Love.\"\n\n\"What Emily's illustrations convey in a way that all my verbage could not is beyond my wildest imagination because that's what makes it accessible,\" Crowe said.\n\nWhat to do, what not to do\n\nEmpathy can be a powerful tool that strengthens relationships and bonds, and it's a critical tool to nurture rather than ignore, McDowell said. The book takes readers through the dos and don'ts, as well as diving into the reasons behind them.\n\nDon't do this: \"The absolute worst thing you can do is nothing,\" McDowell said. \"That is so much worse than reaching out and fumbling or saying, 'I don't know what to say, but I care and I want to be here for you.' \n\n\"The person going through a hard time doesn't expect everyone in their life to become an emotional ninja and know what to do and say, but when people don't try it's really hurtful.\"\n\nIt's because we don't want to do or say something hurtful, but we also don't want to fail, Crowe said. When someone is experiencing a tough time, the potential for failure feels even greater.\n\nBe kind to yourself: The first step is self-care and taking stock of who you are, Crowe said. Focus on positives rather than putting yourself down if you're afraid to connect and figure out your roadblocks to empathizing with others. \n\n\"Trust yourself and trust that you are not perfect at this because no one is perfect at this,\" Crowe said. \"Your friend isn't looking for you to turn into Oprah, they are just looking for you.\"\n\nUnderstand grief: After taking a deeper look at yourself, it may be easier to stand in the other person's shoes and determine the source of their grief and how you can show support and offer kindness. Grief looks different for different people and it's important to remember that it doesn't have an expiration date, McDowell said. \n\n\"When someone passes away that we don't know very well, we grieve, feel sad and life gets back to normal,\" McDowell said. \"But for the loved one, there is no normal to go back to. Try to remember that with grief, talking about the person who died is welcome, whether it was a month or two years ago. People generally want to talk about them.\"\n\nIt's not about you: Apart from doing nothing, even the best-intentioned attempts at empathy can go horribly wrong and turn a supportive gesture into a conversation all about yourself, Crowe said. Trying to make a tragedy or issue seem miniscule by using the phrase \"at least\" is one way. Or in an effort to relate, reaching to make a comparison about an experience that isn't comparable at all is also unhelpful.\n\nCrowe herself recounted a time when her friend, Carla, confided that she had multiple sclerosis but was feeling optimistic. In an effort to show Carla that she didn't have to sugarcoat the news, Crowe shared a story about a college friend with MS who ended up starving herself to death. \n\n\"Thanks to Carla's gracious understanding and forgiveness, our friendship remains incredibly close, and I went on to learn a bunch of better ways to support a friend,\" Crowe said. \n\nIt's not an equation, either: Another misguided attempt at empathy is when people try to solve someone else's problem. These aren't problems to be solved, and those attempts can make people feel judged, misunderstood, even if that isn't the intention, McDowell said. \n\nKeep it simple: Sometimes, shutting up and listening is the best option, Crowe said. Simple gestures can have the greatest impact. In her Empathy Bootcamp workshops, Crowe found that many people listed things like texting, calling and listening as the best and most memorable things people did for them.\n\n\"It can be really simple,\" McDowell said. \"Somebody that cares enough to text every day just to check in and doesn't require a response back but is doing it just because they want to, or someone who shows up once a week with food and a standing date to watch TV.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.177777782082558, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1002, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.90624861148, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170119100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.09580838323353, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/22/politics/ip-forecast-white-house-seating-and-trump-administration/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Who's closest to President Trump in the new White House?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 876, "date": "20170122190000", "story_content": "Prime real estate in the Trump White House, hiccups and help in filling important jobs, making sure agencies know who is boss -- and a big question for the now former President Barack Obama.

And it is certainly true in the White House. Even a tiny spot next to the Oval Office is more coveted than a larger space upstairs in the West Wing.\n\nCNN's Jeff Zeleny took us through the competition in the new Trump power structure, including presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner's move into a tiny space that offers the closest proximity to the President.\n\n\"Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, I'm told will have the chief of staff's office, which has a fireplace as we all know, long conference table, access to outside,\" revealed Zeleny.\n\n\"I'm told that Jared Kushner will be sitting in a smaller office, but the one that is closest to the Oval Office.\"\n\n \n\n2)  A frequent Trump critic comes to his aid in CIA  fight\n\nGen.

But Peter Baker of The New York Times called it an episode worth watching as we see how strong a hand the new White House will try to take over the minute-to-minute actions of far flung government agencies.\n\n \"My colleague from the New York Times tweeted out on Friday pictures we've all been looking at of the different inaugurations. \n\nIt was then retweeted by the National Park Service, which is normally in charge of that patch of ground and they got in trouble for that,\" reports Baker.\n\n\"The Trump people didn't like that and the National Park Service went offline. It's a really interesting period; agencies in the government, which are probably pretty suspicious of this new president, to watch them deal with a new president who is pretty suspicious of them.\"\n\n4) Help wanted: Important vacancies remain unfilled\n\nAs prospective Trump Cabinet members get their hearings on Capitol Hill, there is a scramble to find key deputies across the sprawling federal bureaucracy.\n\nThere are worries in GOP circles that team Trump is running behind in making these choices -- and stories across Washington that one issue is getting people to say yes.\n\nTop Trump aides say not to worry, and promise a steady stream of announcements in the days ahead.\n\nBut the Treasury Department is one example. Steven Mnuchin is the Wall Street veteran tapped to lead the department. CNN is told he wants a veteran Washington hand as his top deputy, but was unsuccessful in his first foray. GOP sources say the Trump transition team identified Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling as a good fit. But word is Hensarling -- who was considered but not chosen for the top Treasury job -- said he wasn't interested.\n\n                \n\n5) The party needs a leader -- will Obama weigh in?\n\nBarack Obama is now a former president and private citizen but promises to step into some political battles if he deems it right or necessary. A big question in Washington is whether his list includes the race to lead the Democratic National Committee.\n\nWe know Obama's favorite in the race is Tom Perez, who was most recently Obama's labor secretary.\n\nBut will the former president work the phones and twist arms to help Perez round up votes?\n\nCNN's Nia-Malika Henderson explored the dynamics.\n\n\"His guy, Tom Perez, the former labor secretary, is running as well as Michael Blake who is running as the vice chair; he is an Obama staffer.

Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump's pick to be United States attorney general, launched a public campaign as Alabama attorney general in 1996 to prevent a gay rights group from holding a conference at the University of Alabama, according to a KFile review of contemporaneous press accounts and legal filings.\n\nSessions's record in public office is coming under increased scrutiny now that he has been selected as Trump's attorney general. He has been a staunch opponent of the LGBT rights movement. He dubbed the Supreme Court's 2015 decision legalizing gay marriage an \"effort to secularize, by force and intimidation.\" And in 2000 and 2009 he voted against measures expanding hate crime legislation to include sexual orientation. He's also co-sponsor, along with other prominent Republicans, of The First Amendment Defense Act, a  bill opponents have dubbed \"a right to discriminate.\" President-Elect Donald Trump has vowed he'd sign the measure. \n\nAs Alabama's attorney general in 1996, Sessions attempted to stop the Southeastern Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual College Conference from meeting at the University of Alabama under a state law passed in 1992 that made it illegal for public universities to fund in any way a group that promotes \"actions prohibited by the sodomy and sexual misconduct laws.\"\n\nThe stated mission of the Southeastern Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual College Conference was to educate and start a dialogue about the LGBT community. Scheduled events at the conference included a workshop on coming out, an interfaith panel of LGBT issues, a discussion on preventing STDs, and discussions on the Internet and substance abuse.\n\nFob James, the Republican governor of Alabama, said he believed the conference violated the 1992 law.  Sessions agreed, though initially said he wouldn't take legal action to intervene. A spokeswoman for Sessions told the Birmingham News that the law was \"fuzzy\" on such events, and it would be hard to take legal action to stop the conference.\n\n\"This is a matter that the university and board of trustees need to deal with,'' Sessions was quoted as saying by the Mobile Register. Still, Sessions opinion was clear. \"University officials say they're going to try to obey the law,'' Sessions was quoted as saying. \"I don't see how it can be done without canceling this conference.''\n\nA spokesperson for Sessions declined to comment for this story.\n\nSessions wrote a letter to University President Roger Sayers giving his opinion the conference violated state law and asking that it be cancelled.\n\n\"I remain hopeful that if the administration does not act, the board of trustees will,'' Sessions stated, adding there were limits on restricting free speech on college campuses and that taxpayers should not have to pay for the conference.\n\nUniversity officials saw the conference as a First Amendment issue, and fought for it to go forward.\n\n\"We are reviewing the attorney general's letter,'' Culpepper Clark, an aide to the school president was quoted as saying at the time by the Mobile Register. \"We will consider his recommendation. As the attorney general knows and is clear and well established in law, the university has a duty to err on the side of the First Amendment.'\"\n\nSessions then stepped up his efforts.\n\nAt a news conference reported by multiple news outlets at the time, he said he might try to get a court order to stop the conference. Several days later, a federal judge struck down Alabama's 1992 law as unconstitutional.\n\nUS District Judge Myron Thompson, in his opinion striking down the law, wrote that it was \"an open effort by the State Legislature to limit the sexuality discussion in institutions of higher learning to only one viewpoint: that of heterosexual people. This viewpoint limitation violates the first amendment.\"\n\nSessions vowed to appeal, and told reporters he would even seek an injunction to stop the conference.\n\n\"I intend to do everything I can to stop that conference,\" Sessions said, according to the Huntsville Times. \"The Legislature gave serious thought to trying to craft a statute that passed muster,'' Sessions added.  \"And I believe that my responsibility is to defend the laws of the Legislature.''\n\nAs the fight over the conference made national press, interest and opposition in it swelled.\n\nSessions' attempts to block the conference, however, would come up short. On the Tuesday before the weekend conference was set to begin, Judge Thompson reiterated his opinion that the conference could not be stopped.\n\nIn response, Sessions argued before Thompson that he sought the ability to monitor the conference for violations of the law, not to stop it.\n\n\"The State of Alabama will experience irreparable harm by funding a conference and activities in violation of state law,\" Sessions argued. His request for a stay on the ruling was denied.\n\nIn a press conference after the ruling, Sessions said they would look at further options, if possible, but options were limited.  \n\n\"We feel like the Alabama statute needs to defended and we do plan to appeal Judge Thompson's ruling,\" Sessions. \"We've got to make a decision about what we'll do about the actual conference. Judge Thompson's ruling said that on its face the Alabama statute is unconstitutional and indicated that any attempt to enforce it he would stop and so we've got evaluate whether or not there's anything we do can with the university at this point.\"\n\n\"We have done everything we can,\" a Sessions spokesperson later told the Birmingham News.\n\nThe event began that Friday to little protest. The conference's attendance, however, was said to have increased.\n\n\"It was probably better attended than it would have been. So, in some ways what they did backfired,\" said Cathy Lopez Wessel, a conference organizer told CNN.\n\nStill, she said she had been caught off guard at the resistance. \"What really struck me was that this seemed clearly to be about free speech and peaceable assembly. I feel like Jeff Sessions used the full power of his office position to deny a student group the right to have a conference.\"\n\nSessions would go on to successfully run for the US Senate that year.\n\nLater attempts to appeal the ruling to the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals failed. A three-judge panel on the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals would affirm the 1996 decision. The state ultimately decided to not appeal that ruling.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.49252247810364, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 1, "wordcount": 948, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 17, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.922540498430001, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.21940928270042, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/politics/donald-trump-computers-internet-email/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 815, "scraper_regex": 861}}, "headline": "Trump, the computer and email skeptic-in-chief", "wordcount_as_scraped": 861, "date": "20161229230000", "story_content": "Next month, President-elect Donald Trump will become the third US president to be inaugurated in the 21st century, an age shaped by computers and the Internet.\n\nBut for all his social media prowess, the 70-year-old incoming president remains skeptical of emails, the Internet and, ultimately, \"the whole ... age of computer.\"\n\n\"I think the computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole, you know, age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what's going on. We have speed and we have a lot of other things, but I'm not sure you have the kind of security you need,\" Trump told reporters Thursday evening.\n\nWhile widespread Internet and email use has made Americans more vulnerable to problems like hacking and identity theft, Trump's view of computers doesn't seem to jibe with that of most Americans.\n\nNearly three-quarters of American adults own a desktop or laptop computer and 92% of Internet users use email, according to the Pew Research Center. Trump's soon-to-be predecessor, President Barack Obama, uses laptop computers and owns an iPad, on which he sometimes receives the President's Daily Brief of classified information.\n\nBut Trump's skepticism of computers isn't just a matter of connecting with Americans. Trump will come into office at a time when the US faces intense cybersecurity challenges, from radicalization of US citizens online to a slew of recent hacks orchestrated by the Chinese and Russian governments.\n\nAsked about whether he favors sanctioning Russia for meddling in the US presidential election by hacking Democratic Party groups and individuals -- as confirmed by the US intelligence community -- Trump demurred: \"I think we ought to get on with our lives.\"\n\nThe President-elect has continued to resist the Intelligence Community's findings regarding Russian hacking, continuing to cast doubt in recent weeks as to whether Russia was truly behind the hack that the CIA, Director of National Intelligence and FBI all agree was aimed at bolstering Trump in the 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump's public distrust of those conclusions may have grown out of his concern for protecting the power of his electoral mandate, but his general skepticism about computers and email is not new.\n\n\"I don't do the email thing,\" Trump said in a sworn deposition in 2007, as reported by The New York Times.\n\nHis secretary sometimes sent emails on his behalf, but he did not. Nor did he own a personal home or office computer.\n\nIn a 2013 deposition, Trump said he used email only \"very rarely.\"\n\nAnd on the campaign trail, Trump sometimes explained his dislike for, and even distrust for, email in the context of bashing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server and the DNC hack, which boosted his campaign.\n\n\"I'm not an email person,\" Trump said during a July press conference in which he invited Russia to uncover and release Clinton's deleted emails. \"I don't believe in it because I think it can be hacked, for one thing. But when I send an email -- if I send one -- I send one almost never. I'm just not a believer in email.\"\n\nSimilarly, just 29% of American adults are somewhat or very confident their email records are private and secure -- though it doesn't keep most from using email nonetheless.\n\nBut Trump's distrust of emails doesn't just stem from a fear he could be hacked. It's also a way he's sought to shield himself from lawsuits.\n\n\"I go to court and they say produce your emails. I say I don't have any emails. The judges don't even believe it,\" Trump said at a Tampa, Florida, rally in February at which he explained that he's \"not a big believer in emails.\" \"After you win the case, they say, 'Now I know that you're really smart.'\"\n\nAnd in a 2005 interview on Howard Stern's radio show, Trump talked about friends of his \"under indictment right now because they sent emails to each other about how they're screwing people.\"\n\nStill, Trump has not eschewed technology altogether.\n\nThe candidate shot to political relevance by opining on a range of current events and pop culture topics via Twitter long before he launched his run for president.\n\nAnd during the campaign, Trump masterfully used the social media platform to drive the campaign narrative, needling and insulting political rivals and pushing back on damaging news stories with a series of 140-character tweets.\n\nThe President-elect owns a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, which he uses primarily to make phone calls and blast out his late-night tweets when no one is around for him to dictate them to.\n\nBut unlike a growing number of Americans, Trump doesn't get his news online.\n\nThe billionaire's daily routine has long begun by reading print newspapers -- usually The New York Times and New York Post -- and watching TV news shows, rather than reading articles online. Just 2 in 10 Americans typically get their news from print newspapers while 38% get their news online, according to a Pew Research Center study.\n\nNews articles from online publications still reach him, after a member of his staff has printed them off. That's prompted several reporters to receive printouts of their articles scrawled with Trump's handwriting delivering a critique of the story.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.21483945846558, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 815, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.7296634173099998, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.2269938650306698, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/opinions/comeback-for-death-penalty-opinion-sarat/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "A comeback for the death penalty?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 866, "date": "20161114130000", "story_content": "After years of declining use of the death penalty across the United States and declining public support for capital punishment, last week's election gave hope to death penalty proponents. The results of balloting in California, Oklahoma and Nebraska as well as the election of Donald Trump seem to foretell a comeback of capital punishment. \n\nYet the foundations of the case against capital punishment remain strong and the likelihood of continuing progress toward abolishing the death penalty remains great.\n\nFor supporters of capital punishment the most consequential development was the election of Donald Trump. Trump is such a vocal and enthusiastic supporter of capital punishment that, in December of 2015, he promised members of the New England Police Benevolent Association that he would issue an executive order as president containing the \"strong, strong statement\" that he wants the death penalty for those found guilty of killing a police officer. \n\n\"Anybody,\" Trump said, \"killing a policeman, a policewoman, a police officer, anybody killing a police officer: Death penalty is going to happen, okay?\" \n\nTrump's election is likely to put on hold any prospect that the Supreme Court will take up Justice Stephen Breyer's recent invitation to his fellow justices to reconsider the constitutionality of capital punishment. \n\nState votes are bad news for death penalty foes\n\nThe results of referendum questions on the ballot in California, Nebraska and Oklahoma also brought bad news for abolitionists. Voters in California delivered a double-barreled blow. They rejected Proposition 62, a measure which would have replaced capital punishment for murder with life in prison without parole. They also approved by a narrow margin a separate measure intended to speed up executions. That measure designates special courts to hear challenges to death penalty convictions, limits successive appeals and expands the pool of lawyers who could handle those appeals. \n\nNebraska voters, by a margin of 61% to 39%, approved reinstating that state's death penalty one year after state legislators voted to abolish it. \n\nIn Oklahoma, 66% of voters supported State Question 776 declaring that the death penalty cannot be considered cruel and unusual under the state constitution. It added a provision that \"any method of execution shall be allowed, unless prohibited by the United States Constitution.\" \n\nDespite these electoral victories, the likelihood of a reversal of fortune for capital punishment is remote. The high costs of capital prosecutions, serious doubts about the reliability of capital convictions, concerns about arbitrariness in death sentencing, and the difficulty of finding reliable methods of execution remain. \n\nThese issues have allowed death penalty opponents to build their case state by state, appealing to public officials and offering them a different way to frame opposition to capital punishment.    \n\nOver the last decade, that strategy has led to judicial or legislative abolition in New York, New Jersey, New Mexico, Illinois, Connecticut, Maryland, Nebraska (a decision reversed by Tuesday's referendum) and Delaware. \n\nIts success can also be seen in the dramatic drop in the number of death sentences handed out across the United States. They have been cut from 315 in 1996 to 49 in 2015. \n\nThe number of executions also has declined significantly, going from 98 in 1999 to 28 last year. \n\nWhy death penalty is on the decline\n\nThese changes have occurred because abolitionists have reframed the way many judges, legislatures, and governors think about capital punishment. The focus of political and legal debates has moved from moral and philosophical abstractions toward a careful consideration of the way the death penalty works in practice. Even after the recent election, public officials can continue to oppose the death penalty by questioning whether its day-to-day practices are compatible with central American values, like due process and equal treatment. \n\nAs former Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn explained in 2011 when he signed a bill to end the death penalty, \"I have concluded that our system of imposing the death penalty is inherently flawed. Since our experience has shown that there is no way to design a perfect death penalty system, free from the numerous flaws that can lead to wrongful convictions or discriminatory treatment, I have concluded that the proper course of action is to abolish it.\"  \n\nWhile they did not persuade the citizens of California, Nebraska or Oklahoma, opponents of the death penalty have made substantial progress with the American public. A 2015 national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 71% of Americans believed that there is some risk that an innocent person will be put to death and only 26% thought that there are adequate safeguards in place to make sure that does not happen. That same survey found that 52% of respondents agreed that minorities are more likely than whites to be sentenced to death for similar crimes. \n\nBecause of these concerns about the risk of executing the innocent and about racial discrimination in capital sentencing, 42% of the public now opposes the death penalty, the highest such opposition has been since 1972. \n\nLast week's electoral results are a reminder that the death penalty continues to have powerful populist and symbolic appeal, but it does not foretell a comeback for capital punishment. Abolitionists will remain on the offensive, and America still seems to be on the road to abolition.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.97674417495728, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 849, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.16661368869, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114130000, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 7, "pct_mft_words": 2.82685512367491, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/03/opinions/vicious-cycle-of-terror-lenarz-opinion/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [1365]}}, "headline": "Terrorism plays into the hands of Erdogan and Assad", "wordcount_as_scraped": 753, "date": "20170103140000", "story_content": "The first day of 2017 started with a horrific terrorist attack in Turkey. A gunman opened fire into a crowd of hundreds at one of Istanbul's most popular nightclubs, killing at least 39 people and injuring dozens more. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the massacre in an official statement released by its news agency Amaq. \n\nOver recent months, Turkey has been hit by a wave of atrocities carried out by ISIS, the PKK, and breakaway factions of the outlawed Kurdish group. \n\nThe early Sunday attack is part of a global Islamist insurgency. It links the bloodshed in Istanbul to Berlin, Paris, Nice, Baghdad, Tel Aviv, Jakarta and other places where Islamic extremists try to impose their ideology by gunpoint.\n\nHowever, there is another dynamic at play that is too often overlooked. If terrorists strike in countries engulfed in war or political turmoil, governments exploit the chaos to further their own strategic interests.\n\nTurkey is no exception. While Turkish civilians bear the brunt of mounting casualties, the government has turned every attack into an opportunity to cleanse the country of dissenting voices and advance its geopolitical ambitions. Following the attack on Reina nightclub, the Turkish government announced that it was extending the state of emergency declared after the failed coup d'\u00e9tat in July by three months to fight \"terrorism.\"  \n\nHowever, since the coup failed to dislodge the AKP government, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has launched a widespread purge that has impacted tens of thousands of officials across Turkish society. Thousands of people have been dismissed, suspended, and imprisoned on charges of supporting US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey has identified as the alleged mastermind behind the coup -- an accusation he denies.\n\nTurkey has also used the wave of terrorist attacks to crack down on the Kurdish minority in the country. Democratically elected politicians have been arrested, Kurdish rights organizations shut down, and peaceful demonstrations dispersed with extreme force.\n\nIn January 2016, an ISIS suicide bomber denoted himself in Istanbul's Sultanahmet Square and in March a second suicide bombing took place in the city's Beyoglu district. \n\nIn retaliation, Turkey not only targeted ISIS positions inside Syria, but also bombed Kurdish groups allied with the US.\n\nIt does not stop there. For a long time, the Turkish government turned a blind eye to the so-called \"Jihadi Highway\" -- the ISIS smuggling route through Gaziantep to get recruits and weapons into Syria. \n\nWhy? Probably because ISIS contained the influence of Kurdish forces that control almost the entire territory along the border with Turkey. \n\nIt was only after ISIS strongholds collapsed in northern Syria that Ankara intervened and assisted Free Syrian Army rebels on the ground. \n\nA similar dynamic is also evident in Syria. Many have voiced concern that in the early stages of the conflict, Bashar al-Assad set free Islamic extremists from prison, likely in the hope that they would create an enemy seen as more menacing by the West than the crimes committed by his regime. \n\nThe rise of ISIS and other jihadist entities allowed Assad to present himself not as the butcher of peaceful activists, freedom-loving students and democracy-embracing intellectuals, but as the bulwark against extremism. \n\nHis calculation paid off: the more that the opposition became infiltrated by Islamists and jihadists, the more the legitimacy of the uprising was called into question.  \n\nThe jihadists, on the other hand, could not have asked for a more potent recruitment tool than the industrial-scale killing unleashed by the Assad regime, aided by the strategic apathy and moral myopia of Western governments. \n\nThis dynamic soon creates a vicious cycle: Terrorists and regimes get caught in a downward spiral of attacks, retaliation, fresh recruitment, more attacks, and even more retaliation. \n\nThe lessons commonly drawn from America's post-9/11 experiences in Iraq and, to a lesser extent, Afghanistan are the wrong ones. \n\nThe answer to the failures of intervention cannot be inaction in the face of a gigantic crisis such as the war in Syria: a conflict impossible to contain within its borders. \n\nThe Obama administration's departure from US exceptionalism and its strategy to let regional players take agency has badly backfired. \n\nDictatorships and authoritarian regimes as well as terrorist organizations have taken advantage of the power vacuum left by the US. The consequences have been devastating. \n\nThe global Islamist insurgency has been boosted by the bloodshed in Syria and brought mayhem onto Europe's streets, while people in the Middle East find themselves trapped between strongmen and terrorist organizations that only have their own interests and the retention of power at heart.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -9.481668472290039, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 741, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 13, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.96054925651, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 10, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170103140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.99325236167341, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/17/politics/david-friedman-ambassador-to-israel-nominee/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Why Trump's Israel ambassador could upend relations in the Middle East", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1522, "date": "20161217210000", "story_content": "Donald Trump's designated ambassador to Israel signals a potential shift in long-standing US policy that has implications for Washington's relationships in the region, with Europe and even the American Jewish community. \n\nThe President-elect tapped New York-based attorney David Friedman Thursday to represent the United States. Friedman, who maintains a residence in Jerusalem, is known for hardline views that depart from decades of established American policy and in some cases are to the right of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nFriedman argues that Israeli settlement construction in Palestinian areas shouldn't be illegal and has called the effort to find a two-state solution an \"illusion.\" In Trump's announcement, the bankruptcy lawyer and Orthodox Jew welcomed moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to \"Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem\" -- settling in one phrase a fraught issue that has been designated for final peace talks, as Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital as well.\n\nThe upshot, analysts and experts say, is that there's likely turbulence ahead. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has ebbed as an issue of concern for the Middle East, roiled by five years of war that have changed regional dynamics. But a US shift in the status quo of Jerusalem -- home to the third-holiest site in Islam as well as the holiest in Judaism -- and away from forging a state for the Palestinians, long seen as an important cause by other Arabs, could revive regional tensions. \n\n\"Immediate reaction will be muted, but over time, if the US does support a dramatic change in the status quo that undermines Palestinians or undermines chances for some sort of independent Palestinian state in the future, it's going to cause a problem for Arab governments,\" said Haim Malka, deputy director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"And then it could become a point of contention between those Arab governments and the US government.\"\n\nThe Israeli Embassy in Washington declined to comment, saying it expected Netanyahu to address Friedman's nomination at a Sunday Cabinet meeting. But Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely welcomed the nomination and said Friedman's views reflected a \"desire to strengthen the standing of Israel's capital Jerusalem at this time and to underscore that the settlements have never been the true problem in the area.\"\n\nPalestinians, however, expressed dismay.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, said it was \"not encouraging\" to have Friedman be nominated, adding that, \"People who say there is no place for a Palestinian state in the new American administration are changing all of the promises that were made by all previous administrations.\"\n\nTalk about transferring the US Embassy to Jerusalem \"would be, in our opinion, a violation of international law,\" he said, describing the climate of this appointment as \"very dangerous, because if the hope for a two-state solution is killed, then what's the alternative for Palestinians?\"\n\nThere are also US relationships with other countries in the region to consider. While the US is less dependent on Middle Eastern oil, Washington still works closely with Arab partners on counterterrorism efforts, intelligence-sharing and the war in Syria. Egypt offers the US military priority passage through the Suez Canal and overflight rights, while Saudi Arabia reportedly provides bases for US drone flights. \n\nBut the Trump team is arguing that this choice will help shore up the US-Israel relationship, which has been strained by differences between Netanyahu and President Barack Obama. Israel has sought international recognition of Jerusalem as its capital for decades, and the issue is one of the most emotionally resonant with Israeli citizens and many Jews worldwide.\n\nJason Greenblatt, who, with Friedman, was a co-chair of Trump's Israel Advisory Committee, said Friedman \"is a wonderful choice to serve as the United States ambassador to Israel.\" He added that Friedman \"has tremendous passion for and devotion to Israel. David's appointment is proof positive that President-elect Trump will be a true friend to Israel.\"\n\nIt's unknown what a Trump administration will actually do once it's in office. There's also the question of how prominent figures within the administration will influence policy. \n\nTrump's pick to lead the Pentagon, retired Gen. James Mattis, has broader experience and relationships in the Arab world than Friedman, Malka noted, \"and they may take those relationships into consideration when they're making decisions about Israel and the Palestinians.\" \n\nAnd in the wake of the Arab Spring, which has seen governments change and violence sweep the Arab world, the cause of the Palestinians has decreased in primacy.\n\nRight now, \"Palestinians are a pretty low priority for the Arabs,\" said one Middle East expert who asked to speak anonymously because of ties to the incoming administration. \"But if you change the status quo, that could change the calculations of the leadership of these countries and set back some of the progress\" that Israel has made in developing better ties to the region.  \n\nEric Trager, an Egypt expert with the Washington Institute on Near East Policy, said repression under the country's current leader could mean people are more afraid to publicly protest the US and Israel than they have been in the past.\n\nBut he notes that an embassy move would \"likely create complications for Jordan,\" whose King is the official custodian of the Muslim holy site in Jerusalem and whose population is 60% Palestinian.\n\nOfficial US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel would also cause trouble for Saudi Arabia, said Bruce Riedel, director of the Intelligence Project at the Brookings Institution and a former CIA analyst. \n\n\"If the US does move the embassy to Jerusalem and does it in a way that the ambassador-designate says -- which is a recognition that it is the eternal, undivided capital of Israel -- I think the Saudis will find that very, very hard to ignore and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will come back onto the agenda,\" Riedel said. \n\nThe Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 requires the US government to move the embassy to Jerusalem, but the law includes a waiver if presidents deem there's a threat to national security. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all used the waiver to decline to relocate the embassy after being elected.\n\nShiite Iran, the Saudi's great religious and geopolitical rival, has publicly heaped scorn on Sunni Saudi Arabia for its closer ties to Israel, using it as a propaganda tool in an attempt to turn other Arabs against the region's wealthiest country. \n\nRiedel called moving the embassy to Jerusalem a \"self-inflicted wound\" for Washington: \"This would undermine whatever small degree to which the United States has been seen as an honest broker\" Riedel said. The suggestion \"really undermines and signals that the two-state solution, if not dead, is comatose and would require extraordinary action to revive.\"  \n\nArab reaction has been muted, but privately diplomats expressed confusion and concern about the pick, which one diplomat said flies in the face of Trump's stated goal of being \"neutral\" when it came to Middle East peace.\n\nJust this week, Walid Phares, a foreign policy adviser to Trump during the campaign, told Arab diplomats the President-elect hoped to negotiate what he has called the \"ultimate deal\" between Israelis and Palestinians. \n\n\"And then he goes and appoints someone like David Friedman who holds these views,\" one diplomat said. \"It's insulting.\"  \n\nThat may also complicate US relationships with European allies who have been strongly supportive of the search for a two-state solution.\n\nIn reaction, a burgeoning movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel could grow stronger, and \"you could see stronger European moves in international organizations and more European Parliaments recognizing a Palestinian state,\" Malka said.\n\nAt the same time, some supporters of Israel think that having the strong backing of the United States could help neutralize the issue on the international agenda, with Washington's veto power at the UN Security Council tacitly keeping European and other countries less inclined to act against Israel.  \n\nFriedman's appointment and a rightward shift in policy could also deepen rifts within the American Jewish community, Malka said, because he \"is associated so closely with pro-settlement and rightwing causes in Israel, which is are ideals which are at odds with the majority of the American Jewish community.\"\n\nFriedman has been openly contemptuous of the liberal Jewish organization J Street, which openly favors a two-state solution, calling them \"worse than kapos,\" a reference to Jews who worked with the Nazis during World War II to guard prison camps. \n\nJ Street said it \"vehemently\" opposed Friedman and said he \"should be beyond the pale for senators considering who should represent the United States in Israel\" when they consider whether to confirm him.\n\nBut there are also many American Jews -- increasing Orthodox and right-leaning politically even as the vast majority remain Democrats -- who welcome the appointment of someone they see as an unabashed supporter of the Jewish state.\n\n\"The selection of Mr. David Friedman to serve as United States Ambassador to Israel sends a powerful signal to the Jewish community and the State of Israel that President-elect Trump's administration will strengthen the bond between our two countries and advance the cause of peace within the region,\" the Republican Jewish Coalition said in a statement.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.3924050331115703, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0,

a nationwide ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey. \n\nSyria's military said it halted operations at midnight, except against ISIS and other terror groups, state-run news agency SANA reported.\n\nA Syrian activist group based in the UK said indications were there were pockets of violence, but large areas of the country were calm.\n\n\"Most areas in Syria are quiet since the start of the ceasefire, but violent clashes were reported less than two hours after it took effect in the Hama suburbs between regime forces and rebel fighters in Tal Beejo in northern Aleppo causing to regime forces to withdraw,\" said Rami Abdulrahman of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nNeither SANA nor Russian state media has reported episodes of violence Friday morning. \n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday announced the agreement that the Syrian government and opposition rebels would cease fighting in the country's long-running civil war. \n\nAccording to Russian state media TASS, Putin said the two sides had also agreed to enter peace talks to end the conflict that has raged for nearly six years.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said earlier that Russia and Turkey would be guarantors to the agreement.\n\nGroups considered as terrorist organizations by the UN Security Council, such as ISIS, are excluded from the agreement, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.\n\nFragile agreement\n\nPutin announced the deal at a meeting with Russian foreign and defense ministers. \"Reports have just arrived that several hours ago there was a development that we all have looked and worked for so long,\" he said.\n\nThree documents had been signed, Putin said: the ceasefire agreement, a package of measures to oversee the ceasefire and a declaration of readiness to enter into peace talks.\n\nPutin said the \"agreements reached are very fragile\" and that they demanded \"special attention and patience.\"\n\nA statement from the Kremlin, carried by Russian news agencies, said Putin and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad discussed the agreement by telephone Thursday.\n\nAssad said he would comply with it, according to the statement. Putin and Syria's President consider the ceasefire negotiations \"an important step for a final solution of the crisis,\" the statement added.    \n\nTurning point\n\nA successful nationwide ceasefire hinges on many fighting factions laying down arms -- groups from Iraq, Iran and Lebanon are also fighting alongside the forces of Assad's regime.\n\nIn a news conference in Turkey's capital, the legal adviser for the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army, Osama Abu Zeid, called the agreement \"a complete truce with no exceptions or preconditions\" that included \"all areas and military factions in Syrian opposition territory.\" \n\n\"The main goal is improving the living conditions for Syrian citizens,\" he said.\n\n\"Our message to the Syrian population (is) that our fingers will remain on the trigger and we will present all sacrifices and we will take every path that will alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people.\" \n\nHadi Al Bahra of the Istanbul-based opposition Syrian National Coalition told CNN on Thursday that the ceasefire negotiations involved the military and humanitarian sides of the conflict, not Syria's political future. \n\n\"Assad is a big part of the problem; he doesn't have the capacity to really go forward with the peace agreement,\" he said of Syria's President.\n\nThe Syrian rebel group Ahrar al-Sham did not sign the ceasefire agreement, a spokesman said. \n\n \"Ahrar al-Sham has a number of reservations over the proposed agreement and the negotiations,\" the spokesman, Ahmad Qura Ali, said via Twitter. \"We will make clear our reservations in due course.\"\n\nPutin's announcement comes after several attempts at ceasefires by the international community crumbled. \n\nIt also follows several ceasefire agreements brokered by Turkey and Russia in the city of Aleppo this month. Most were broken, but a final one held and allowed the evacuations of tens of thousands of rebels and civilians from the city's east, which had been under the control of rebel groups for more than four years.\n\nThe Syrian regime then gained full control of Aleppo, a major turning point that has limited the opposition's military and political options. \n\nTurkey and Russia have differed, however, in their stance on Assad -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last month that Turkish forces entered Syria to help end Assad's rule. Russia is Assad's most powerful ally and has propped up his regime since September 2015 with airstrikes.\n\nErdogan on Thursday said the ceasefire \"opportunity in Syria shall not be missed.\" \n\n\"The parties in Syria will not expand the territories they have control over,\" he added. \n\nPutin said Russia would begin scaling back its military presence in Syria, though it would continue to support the \"legitimate Syrian government in its struggle with terrorism.\"\n\nUS sidelined\n\nThe UN Security Council has been widely criticized for failing to find a solution to the Syrian war. \n\nRussia has shot down several resolutions on the conflict, using its veto power as a permanent member of the council.\n\nA spokesperson for the UN Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura welcomed the ceasefire, saying in a statement that a cessation of hostilities was a \"cornerstone\" of a UN Security Council resolution from 2015 on Syria.\n\nThe statement said that de Mistura hoped the agreement would \"save civilian lives, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance across Syria, and pave the way for productive talks in Astana\" in Kazakhstan.\n\nBut the statement also said that the developments should contribute to negotiations convened by the UN in planned Syria talks on February 8.    \n\nTurkey and Russia appear to be sidelining the United States, which has led an international coalition to fight ISIS in Syria and has vehemently opposed any attempt to keep Assad in power.\n\nTurkey has worked with the US to fight ISIS in Syria, but it has worked more closely with Russia in recent months.\n\nUS State Department spokesman Mark Toner acknowledged that Washington was not part of the negotiations but said the agreement was \"a positive development.\"\n\n\"An inclusive Syrian-led political process between the Syrian regime and the opposition is critical for establishing a durable settlement to this conflict,\" he said in a statement. \n\nRussia has long accused the US of arming what it considers terrorist organizations, while Turkey has made similar claims in the past few days.\n\nBut Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed hope Thursday that US President-elect Donald Trump would support Russia's direction on Syria's crisis settlement, Russian state media reported. \n\nAn estimated 400,000 people have been killed in Syria's brutal conflict -- a civil war that has drawn in several world powers. \n\nMeanwhile, the US mission in Syria said Thursday that ISIS gang leader Abu Jandal al-Kuwaiti had been killed Monday in a coalition airstrike.\n\nHe was involved in the use of suicide vehicles, homemade bombs and chemical weapons against the Syrian Democratic Forces, the mission said in a statement. \n\nHe was a member of the militant group's war committee and was involved in ISIS' recapture of the ancient city of Palmyra, the statement said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.02283096313477, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 608, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.2218263902999995, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229120000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.934210526315789, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/opinions/hijab-post-trump-america-opinion-trnd/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1006, "scraper_regex": 1112}}, "headline": "Wearing hijab in Trump's America", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1112, "date": "20161115220000", "story_content": "Over the presidential campaign and in the heated days after the election, I've seen report after report of racist incidents and hate crimes. It seems as though the fear-mongering rhetoric used throughout the campaign may have given a free ticket to those ready to act with hate.  \n\nSome of the stories have touched me on an even more personal level, like seeing stories of Muslim women being insulted or attacked for wearing headscarves.  That some women must fear for their safety in America because of a personal choice they make when getting dressed absolutely baffles me.  They are being forced to conform.\n\nHow can some people be so hateful to attack others with such confidence and not consider the consequences? \n\nThis issue rocks me to my core for two reasons:\n\nThe first? Nearly a year ago I wrote a commentary in these pages about removing my hijab to find myself.  I decided to wear it only part time, and then, after experimenting with it, chose to keep it on full time.  What is hijab? A scarf -- a simple piece of material in many sizes, shapes and colors wrapped over a Muslim woman's head. While for most people the reason to cover may be religious, mine is primarily social.\n\nI choose to wear a hijab as a symbolic expression of diversity in society. I exercise my freedom without fear or influence.\n\nReally: what's the big deal? It's literally just another piece of clothing. But for various reasons, some people try to define it in black or white terms. The reality is that it stands for many things related to fashion, religion, politics and society. It's personal and intimate. It is a woman's choice: what to wear or not wear, an exercise of her preference. In America, I am free to wear it as I please.\n\nBut the freedom feels threatened in a Trump America. Keeping a hijab on may potentially cost me my safety and endanger my young daughters. I find myself worried about every trip I take outdoors with them. Thoughts of being attacked or putting my girls in harm's way fill my head. I wonder: Is it just safer to take it off again so I don't \"look\" Muslim? My faith whispers to keep it on in defiance of fear \u2014 and in my conviction that diversity is a right and a strength in this country.\n\nAnd the second reason for my alarm?\n\nMy older daughter voluntarily shares with just about anyone that she is of Turkish, Egyptian, Pakistani and Indian descent, adding that her ultimate pride is in being American and Muslim. Since her toddler years, she has seen her cultural background as one of the most exciting aspects of her life.   \n\nI teach both my girls to embrace diversity and cherish it in others. They have traveled to many countries and are aware of the complex world around them. I have raised them to honor everyone for their unique differences.\n\nNow, it seems everything I've taught my daughters about diversity as empowerment has been challenged.\n\nI am having to explain the intolerance and hate that surfaced in our nation during the presidential campaign, and seems to be erupting anew since the election. My girls have questions about the spiteful rhetoric they overhear, despite my efforts to protect them from it. They even asked me if news of a Muslim ban was true and if our family will have a place to live. \n\nSuddenly, I find myself needing to prepare them for another life lesson: Honoring diversity in others does not guarantee the same in return.\n\nBut there is more: Openly threatening a woman if she does not remove an article of clothing and further taking action by touching that woman is a violation \u2014 an assault. And as Americans who stand for the rights and freedoms of all, we cannot condone assault, regardless of which side of the political spectrum we may lean. \n\nNo one should contemplate hiding their way into safety by changing the way they look or dress.  And it is not only Muslims in headscarves: Other minorities find themselves looking for ways to fit in while maintaining their identities and staying safe. At least I can remove a scarf from my head; others cannot change their skin color or features to hide their way into safety. \n\nAmerica, we are bigger and better than the few among us who choose to act out of fear rather than love. The America I know is not limited to certain beliefs, it is inclusive of our uniqueness. It has space for all of us.\n\nWe cannot allow hateful speech or differences to divide us. We cannot allow divisiveness to drive us into a fall. We must stand up for ourselves and for our fellow Americans. We must remain united. \n\nThis is not a matter of religious choice, it's the duty of each of us to ensure and protect the same rights for others that we want granted to ourselves.\n\nAnd this brings me to our President-elect, Donald Trump, for whom I have a message:\n\nThe people have elected you to become the next President of the greatest nation in the world. \n\nWe have heard you speak numerous times throughout the campaign about your plans to protect our citizens from the dangers in the world. Thank you for having the passionate desire to keep us safe. But consider this: Security begins at home. Allowing division over differences can lead to hateful crimes, racial slurs and intolerance, and makes Americans less safe. \n\nShortly after you won the election, you stated you would be president to all Americans. In an interview on TV the other night, you even looked into the camera and told your supporters to stop harassing minorities. \"Stop it,\" you said. \n\nI am counting on you to mean it. We need to hear, expressed as loudly as during the campaign, that you believe this country is for ALL Americans. Reassure us that our nation will no longer be motivated by fear and that it will come together as one full of a diversity that is respected and embraced. \n\nWe want you to use your rhetoric. Use your resources. Tweet us messages of tolerance and unity. \n\nI, along with my daughters and all other Americans who value the freedoms and justice afforded to us, anticipate you will start with making America great at home first.  The America that we know stands for liberty and justice for all, so that none of us have to ever contemplate the way I am right now, trading our free choice for safety.\n\nEditor's note: This commentary has been revised from an earlier version that was published prematurely.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.02578258514404, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1006, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.62953905049, "HarmVirtue": 12, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161115220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.3797216699801202, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/opinions/next-world-war-andelman/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Could World War III start here?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 931, "date": "20161103200000", "story_content": "There are few more vulnerable spots along NATO's entire perimeter than the Suwalki Gap, an about 60-mile stretch of territory and a critical rail line separating Poland from Lithuania, linking Russian Kaliningrad with Putin's staunch ally Belarus. If Vladimir Putin takes comfort in NATO's waffling, or doubts US willingness to spring to the defense of the Baltic republics, it's here any shootout between NATO and Russia could start. Or even World War III.\n\nVice President Biden paid an urgent trip to neighboring Latvia in August to meet the presidents of all three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- to assure them that \"we have pledged our sacred honor ... to the NATO treaty and Article 5,\" which says an attack on one NATO ally is an attack on all. And all three Baltics are firm members and believers in NATO. But Biden continued: \"You occasionally hear something from a presidential candidate. It's nothing that should be taken seriously, because I don't think he understands what Article 5 is.\"\n\nDonald Trump's suggestion the United States might not come to the aid of every NATO nation that's attacked unless they contribute more toward NATO has raised questions over America's commitment here. This is, of course, an insane precondition to place on backing a region so devotedly pro-American. Yet the fear is that win or lose, Trump and all he represents may leave a dangerous aftertaste long after the ballots have been counted.\n\n\"We have been a neighbor of Russia not for 100 years but 1,000 years,\" said Marju Lauristin, Estonia's member of the European Parliament and a quarter-century ago one of those who helped free her nation from the Soviet Union. \"But Russia is looking only at Americans. So we are following very closely the debate in America to see what is happening in our part of the world.\"\n\nUntil the present political campaign, the United States had given few suggestions of anything but a total commitment to the three free states of the Baltics. Indeed, throughout World War II and Russian occupation, the Baltic nations' flags were present in the Hall of Flags at the entrance to the State Department in Washington.\n\nThis is only right; it is imperative that America sees the defense of these democratic nations as a pillar of its international posture going forward. In practical terms, this could mean returning American missiles to the region, and extending the US presence beyond the \"tripwire\" troops that now rotate through, and that the Baltics must settle for. After all, these three nations are likely Putin's next target. But whatever happens, we cannot allow a repeat of what happened from the mid-1940s to 1953, when Lithuanian partisans fought a desperate rear-guard action in the forests and swamps of their nation, hoping desperately for the arrival of American troops to join them, as US broadcasts had pledged.\n\nUnfortunately, Russia has made significant moves of it own, with the arrival in Kaliningrad of a battery of intermediate-range Iskander-M missiles, with a range of more than 300 miles and the capacity of carrying nuclear warheads across the Baltics and into Poland -- itself an apparent violation of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty. The Russian Baltic fleet is also a regular presence, its most advanced fighter jets buzzing American ships and reportedly violating Estonian and Finnish airspace.\n\nMeanwhile, Poland, another NATO member, is still awaiting deployment of a missile shield -- a promise by George W. Bush that was scrapped by President Barack Obama when a thaw with Russia was still an American goal. Now, Poland wants to revive such a project on its own dime (actually about 50 billion dimes) by installing eight Patriot missile defense systems, provided Washington approves. It must do so.\n\nNATO's countermoves are portrayed by Western diplomats as significant: a force of 800 British troops with drones and some Challenger tanks into Estonia next spring, a rotating company of American troops (about 300 soldiers) in Lithuania.\n\nBut Russia's moves into this region are far more robust and deeper, in military and propaganda terms. Significant Russian minorities in all three countries are hardly immune. \"The budget of Russia Today [TV] is 40 times that of VOA,\" said Zygimantas Pavilionis, longtime Lithuanian ambassador to the United States and now shadow foreign minister in the new Lithuanian parliament, who tried to help former House Speaker John Boehner understand the challenge. \"When you live 100% immersed in propaganda, the majority start to believe it is true.\" \n\nAt dinner one evening in the Dominic restaurant in Tallinn, two Russian-speaking Estonians at the next table, a cancer surgeon and a businessman, explained why they admired Vladimir Putin. \"He is strong, and he never tells us anything but the truth.\"\n\nBut at the Riga Conference in Latvia a short time later, Andrei Sannikov, a Belarusian dissident now living in exile in Poland, had a different take on the threat. He was talking about the Russian troop transports that cross the Suwalki Gap regularly and the fear expressed by many Baltic leaders that they could suddenly stop and Russian troops could quietly disembark to test NATO and Baltic mettle. \"I am not worried,\" he smiled thinly. \"They will just take one look around them and defect.\"\n\nBut while the clear advantages of the prosperity brought by a democratic capitalism that has taken strong roots in all three of the Baltics is a powerful attraction, there remains an overarching fear that two decades of such progress could be snuffed in an instant by six divisions of Russian armor. Only a persuasive and consistent American determination could serve as a meaningful deterrent.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.99403578042984, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 921, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.35052326166, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161103200000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.4744842562432097, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/29/homepage2/nypd-sikh-officers-turbans-policy-change/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "NYPD changes policy, will allow officers to wear turbans", "wordcount_as_scraped": 819, "date": "20161229060000", "story_content": "Sikh officers can now wear full turbans in the New York Police Department. \n\nNYPD Commissioner James O'Neill announced the policy change Wednesday, flanked by officers in navy blue turbans fastened with police brass. \n\n\"We want to make the NYPD as diverse as possible, and I think this is going to go a long way to help us with that,\" O'Neill said. \n\n\"It's a major change in our uniform policy, so we had to go about it carefully. And now I have the opportunity to make the change, and I thought it was about time that we did that.\" \n\nWhile the NYPD patrol guide maintains a strict policy regarding head coverings, officers will now be able to wear turbans with a religious exemption signed by top department officials, O'Neill said.\n\nThere are about 160 Sikh officers in the NYPD, the commissioner said.\n\nBefore the policy change, Sikh officers could wear a smaller wrap, known as a patka, beneath their official police cap, said Gurvinder Singh, an NYPD officer and president of the national Sikh Officers Association.\n\n\"Now I'll be able to serve with my full turban on. It's a great feeling,\" he said. \n\n\"There will be a lot more Sikh officers now taking the next exam.\" \n\nFacial hair still an issue\n\nThe NYPD also announced Wednesday a religious accommodation allowing for officers to, with approval, grow a beard up to half an inch long. The previous policy had allowed for beards of up to a millimeter in length.\n\nSome leaders in the Sikh community applauded the policy change on turbans, but said the NYPD needed to go further with the policy on facial hair. \n\n\"While it's definitely a great step, we look forward to reviewing the policy in depth and ensuring that Sikhs can serve with their turban and beards intact and with no limitations or restrictions to either,\" said Kavneet Singh, a board member of the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n\nThe turban and the practice of keeping a beard or unshorn hair, known as kesh, are among the articles of faith maintained by Sikhs. \n\nOver the summer, the NYPD was sued by a Muslim officer, Masood Syed, who said he was suspended, stripped of his badge and gun for wearing a beard longer than protocol. \n\nSyed, who lives in Queens, was later reinstated after receiving a temporary restraining order from a Manhattan federal judge, though his case remains open. The class-action suit calls the limitation unconstitutional and Syed is seeking a policy allowing for a 2-inch beard -- long enough to comply with religious doctrine. \n\nIn an interview, Syed called Wednesday's announcement \"arbitrary\" and a \"disappointment.\"\n\n\"I'm still disappointed. If they're saying now that the policy is half an inch and I'm walking around in police headquarters with the top brass, walking around with a beard that's 1 1/2 to 2 inches, where does that leave me? Am I going to be suspended again? Am I going to be walked out of the building again?\" Syed said. \n\nSyed, a lawyer and 10-year veteran of the NYPD, added: \"It's not just for Muslims. We have Sikh officers, we have Jewish officers, we have Israelite officers, who all believe that the beard length should be longer than half an inch, who have all approached me and asked me to represent them and submitted their name in support of this policy. For me, it's important because of my faith and my religion, but it's also important for me to represent those other officers.\"\n\nThe NYPD would not comment Wednesday evening on the ongoing lawsuit. \n\nSimilar police policies rare\n\nOnly about a half dozen police forces across the country have explicit accommodations to allow for Sikhs to serve with a turban and beard, according to SALDEF.\n\nWashington DC's Metropolitan Police Department became the first major force in the country to enact such a policy in 2012, though no Sikhs currently serve there, Singh said. \n\nThe NYPD's new policy follows similar ones in Harris County, Texas -- which includes the city of Houston -- and Riverside, California. Singh said both those forces' policies go further than the NYPD's to allow for full beards. \n\nThe NYPD had previously prohibited beards because they interfere with certain gas masks. \n\nHuge and diverse police department\n\nAs the largest police force in the country, the NYPD has long prided itself on being one of the most diverse.\n\nAbout 900 Muslim Americans serve in the NYPD, city officials have said.

They stress that they have dramatically increased defense expenditures for the next several years while reminding the US that they have contributed troops to US-led military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nFormer Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, who famously fought and lost a war against Russia in 2008, predicts the next several months could be particularly tense. \n\n\"Baltic countries are so vulnerable,\" Saakashvili told CNN from Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, where he is forming a local political party. \n\n\"We see that the military potential of these three countries (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) cannot match, in any way, the Russian military.

A pair of Blackhawk helicopters land, and soldiers from the US Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade pour out, firing a rocket attached to a long cord laced with explosives.\u00a0It detonates, a simulation of how soldiers would blow a path through a deadly minefield in the event of a conflict.\u00a0\n\nUS troops are performing military maneuvers with the Latvian military and a platoon of soldiers from Slovenia as part of a series of joint exercises called \"Atlantic Resolve.\"\n\n\"The origins were in response to Russian activity in 2014, when the strategic situation changed,\" said Colonel Gregory Anderson, who monitored this exercise with his local counterpart Colonel Lejins. \n\nAnderson was referring to Russia's lightning-swift occupation and annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea.\n\nTo confuse and then push Ukrainian troops out of the region, Russia deployed so-called \"little green men,\" well-disciplined Russian forces who wore uniforms without insignia or flags identifying their country of origin.\n\nThe well-choreographed operation has served as a wake-up call to the new strength and sophistication of the Russian military.\u00a0\n\nHow small states prepare for cyber-war\n\nOn the lookout for potential enemies\u00a0\n\nIf a conflict suddenly exploded with Russia, Latvian commanders say their forces would present little more than a \"speed bump\" to an advancing Russian military.\n\n\"Therefore, the US presence here is very important to deter Russian attempts or simply to avoid miscalculation,\" says Garisons, Latvia's secretary of state.\n\nLatvian officials say, Russia has amassed two armies with an estimated 200,000 troops on the other side of the border.\u00a0Five years ago, Russia reestablished a helicopter base with scores of aircraft at a location a short drive from the Latvian border.\u00a0\n\nTo protect itself and its population of nearly two million people, Latvia has only 5,000 professional troops as well as a much larger force of volunteer National Guards.\n\n\"We need to be a good speed bump that takes out the muffler of the enemy so that it is loud enough that there is no question that this is military aggression against one NATO member,\" Colonel Lejins explains. \"Then the activation of (Article 5) occurs.\"\n\nUnder Article 5 of the NATO charter, an attack on one member is considered an attack on all countries in the alliance and requires an active response.\n\nRussian doorstep in Europe\n\nNext, we drive cross country from Latvia, across Lithuania and into Kaliningrad, an exclave of Russian territory sandwiched between Poland and the Baltics, cut off from mainland Russia.\n\nAt the end of World War II, Soviet Red Army soldiers wrenched control of this territory from Nazi Germany. For decades, it was a heavily militarized region, closed off to foreigners.\n\nThe region lurched into the headlines last fall after Russia confirmed reports it deployed nuclear-capable Iskender missiles to Kaliningrad.\n\n\u00a0Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov defended Russia's right to deploy weapons to its sovereign territory in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour last October. \n\n\"They moved NATO infrastructure next to our borders,\" Lavrov said.\u00a0\"And this is not United States territory.\"\n\nIn many ways, Kaliningrad is a historical curiosity. The streets of the main city, which was known in German times as Konigsberg, are lined with grand examples of old German architecture alongside grim, concrete Soviet apartment blocks. \n\nHere, some Russians also expressed hope about the next US government.\u00a0\n\n\"With the change of leadership in the US we are hoping for an improvement in the situation,\" says Konstantin Smernov, a 53-year-old former lieutenant in the Soviet Navy who now works as a real estate agent. \"Confrontation isn't good for anybody.\" \u00a0\n\nWestern governments imposed economic sanctions on Russia after the seizure of Crimea in 2014. In restaurants and in homes here, many Russians said those measures contributed to a broader economic crisis that set in after the plunge in oil prices in recent years.\u00a0 Oil and natural gas are two of Russia's most important exports and the backbone of the country's economy.\n\nThose sanctions, combined with a move last summer to remove visa-free travel for Kaliningrad residents traveling to neighboring Poland, have some here concerned about the former Soviet citadel's increasing isolation.\n\nWhy Russia has been ramping up hostile action\n\nAnna Shugatova was born after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Her dream was to find a job that would allow her to travel. But the 23-year-old, who moved to Kaliningrad from her home in Siberia to pursue a master's degree in linguistics, says that dream is now in doubt. \n\n\"I don't know if I will be able to travel soon. There are tensions between countries,\" Shugatova said.\n\nEchoes of the Cold War\n\nBut several Russians say they've found one advantage to living in an enclave with relatively easy access to countries like Poland and Lithuania. Visitors can purchase and smuggle in foreign foods that are now banned in Russia.\u00a0\n\n\"We are back to the days of smuggling cheese and sausage from abroad,\" said Igor Pleshkov, a businessman and vocal critic of the Kremlin who describes himself as the sole elected member of the opposition on Kaliningrad's city council.\n\nThe Russian port of Baltiysk, about a 45-minute drive towards the coast, is still very much a militarized garrison town.

When King told Grandin about her observations, Grandin said she encouraged King to lead the research.\n\n\"The first thing I thought of when she told me that were the presidents, and how they age and get prematurely gray,\" said Grandin, professor of animal science at Colorado State University, referring to American commanders in chief.\n\n\"The fact that presidents turn prematurely gray was one of the things that made me encourage her to do the study,\" Grandin said. \"Basically, (the study findings) validated what she had seen in years of doing dog behavior work.\"\n\n'I was surprised'\n\nThe study, conducted at Northern Illinois University, involved 400 dogs, 4 years old or younger, with non-white-colored hair so the researchers could adequately determine degrees of graying.\n\n\"Normally, dogs wouldn't be gray at age 4,\" Grandin said.\n\n \n\nThe researchers took two photos of each dog and asked each dog's owner to complete a 21-question survey, which included questions about the dog's anxious or impulsive behaviors. Both behaviors hold clues to how stressed the dog might be, sort of like how emotional instability and anxiety are associated with stress in humans.\n\nAnxious behaviors include whether the dog whines or barks when left home alone or cringes or cowers in groups of people, and impulsivity can be seen in whether the dog jumps on people when greeting them or excessively tugs on the leash when going on walks.\n\nThe dog owners were unaware of the true purpose of the study when they completed the questionnaires.\n\nNext, the researchers compared the survey responses with how much gray hair appeared on the dogs' muzzles in their photos. \n\nGrandin helped the researchers build a scoring system to measure the degrees of grayness: A score of 0 is \"no gray;\" 1 is for gray on the front of the nose only; 2 is for gray hair halfway up the muzzle; and 3 is \"full gray.\"\n\nIt turned out that a high grayness score was significantly and positively predicted by survey responses that indicated both high anxiety and impulsivity.\n\n\"Essentially, the results indicate that for each standard deviation increase in the measured trait, either anxiety or impulsiveness, the odds of being in a higher rating category of muzzle grayness increase 40% to 65%,\" said Thomas Smith, a professor at Northern Illinois University's Department of Educational Technology, Research and Assessment, who was a co-author of the study.\n\nSmith added that he was initially skeptical that a dog's premature muzzle grayness might be linked to anxiety and impulsiveness.\n\n\"However, when we analyzed the data, the results actually were striking,\" he said. \"I was surprised.\"\n\nA similar association between stress and premature graying possibly could be found in other mammals, outside of humans and dogs, but more research is needed, Grandin said.\n\nIs Fido more like us than we thought?\n\nThe new study appears to extend what has been previously seen in people -- the relationship between stress and gray hair -- to dogs, said Matt Kaeberlein, a professor and co-director of the University of Washington's Dog Aging Project, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n\"There are a few things about this study that I really like. One is that it nicely illustrates another way in which dogs and humans are similar, specifically in this case, the way we interact with our environment to experience stress. I like the innovative approach of applying facial image recognition to dogs,\" Kaeberlein said.\n\n\"I do think it's important to keep in mind that while hair graying is a useful 'biomarker' of aging and experienced stress, it is not particularly precise. We should avoid interpreting causation from correlation,\" he said about the study. \"Many dogs and people get gray hair for reasons unrelated to their perception of stress or anxiety, so while anxiety (or) stress appears to cause hair graying, gray hair is not necessarily caused by anxiety or stress. In other words, just because your dog gets gray hair doesn't mean she or he is stressed out.\"\n\nFor instance, more research is needed to determine how much genetics might play a role not only in premature graying in young dogs but also how a dog might respond to stress, Grandin said. She added that additional research could also determine how much of the study results were influenced by anxiety and impulsivity, respectively.\n\n\"There's probably some genetic influence where some dogs that are impulsive and anxious don't turn gray. You see, that would be your genetic interaction, but when you take a big population of dogs, it statistically comes out that anxious and impulsive dogs are more likely to start turning gray before age 4,\" Grandin said. \n\n\"Genetic factors are important, but genetic factors also can be modified by experience, so you can't just say an animal's hard-wired genetics, it's not. It's both. Both genetics and the environment are important,\" she said.\n\nWhat to do if your dog is stressed\n\nIf pet owners notice that their dog is prematurely graying, they should make an appointment with their veterinarian or an applied animal behaviorist, said King, the lead author of the study.\n\n\"A medical workup could be completed along with a screening for anxiety or stress,\" King said. \n\n\"Once a dog is screened, and if found to be anxious or impulsive, there are many treatment options, such as behavior modification programming, medication, alternative techniques such as a pressure wrap,\" she said. \"It is very important to have the dog professionally examined to get to the root of the problem, and not assume that because the dog is prematurely gray, it is related to stress.\"\n\nIf the dog is stressed, what might be a common cause? Being left home alone, Grandin said.\n\n\"I've been very concerned about all these dogs spending so much time home alone all day. I walk through the streets where I live at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and I can hear dogs barking and whining in houses,\" Grandin said. \n\n\"We have bred dogs to be social beings, and then you leave them home all day and they don't get to do much socializing,\" she said. \"I think the home alone problem is a big factor. This is just my opinion.\"\n\nGrandin said one of her colleagues tends to leave his dogs with a friend when he is away from home, and she encourages others to do the same.\n\n\"Some people take their dogs to doggy day care. Some of those are good. Some of them are run poorly,\" she said. \"If you have a dog that does not handle being home alone well, maybe you need to be making arrangements to drop him off at the next door neighbor's on your way to work.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.85829973220825, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1118, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.642824346533, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 4, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161223110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.35778175313059, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.363636363636}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/opinions/putin-wants-yalta-2-0-and-trump-may-give-it-to-him-ghitis/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Putin wants Yalta 2.0 and Trump may give it to him ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1047, "date": "20170125140000", "story_content": "When Americans elected Donald Trump president, they unleashed a political earthquake whose magnitude the entire world is urgently trying to gauge. The list of concerns is far reaching, but for many, the most pressing is whether Trump will keep the United States as an advocate and defender of democracy, freedom, and self-determination. The question comes down to whether Trump is about to carry out a grand betrayal, known to many by the shorthand \"Yalta 2.0.\" \n\nThe term refers to a historic meeting held in 1945, the final days of World War II between the Allies. Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill met in the Black Sea resort of Yalta, in Crimea, to decide the fate of post-war Europe. They carved out the continent for what was supposed to be a period leading to democracy. \n\nWhat came out of Yalta, however, was a divided Europe, with the Soviet Union imposing repressive Communist regimes throughout its sphere of influence -- Eastern Europe and the Soviet Republics -- for nearly half a century.\n\nEastern Europeans felt betrayed and abandoned, and the United States has been trying to atone for Yalta ever since the end of the Cold War by backing efforts to develop democratic institutions, pledging to defend the new countries from aggression, and opening the doors of NATO to independent nations wishing to strengthen ties with the West.\n\nThat policy, along with America's overall commitment to the spread of democracy, human rights, and free markets, appears in doubt since Trump's election. After all, Trump has vowed more than a reset in relations with Moscow. He has vaguely drawn the outlines of what looks potentially like the wholesale demolition and reconstruction of America's post-war foreign policy.  \n\nTalk of a \"New Yalta,\" has been floating for years. In fact, Russian President Vladimir Putin himself declared he seeks a \"New Yalta\" during a speech he gave in Crimea in 2014, after Russia invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula. \n\nAfter the annexation, Europe and the United States rejected Russia's unilateral move as a violation of international law and imposed economic sanctions. But Trump appears prepared to lift sanctions in exchange for yet-to-be-explained concessions.\n\nSome in Trump's team, it's worth noting, seem unpersuaded by prospects for a new relationship with Moscow. Defense Secretary James Mattis noted that, \"Since Yalta [meaning 1945] we have a long list of times we've tried to engage positively with Russia,\" with a \"relatively short list of successes.\"  \n\nBut earlier efforts have never come as part of a policy overhaul of the magnitude that Trump may envision. Previous presidents wanted resets with Russia, but not at the cost of abandoning America's fundamental policies and beliefs.\n\nSince 1945, while the USSR curtailed all manner of freedoms for people living in its sphere of influence, the U.S. crafted what is known as the liberal international order, a network of institutions and like-minded nations grounded on the pursuit of democracy, national sovereignty, and personal and economic freedoms. The practice was far from perfect, but the ideal was always a guiding principle. That's why the US president is known as the \"leader of the free world.\" But it is unclear whether that term should still apply.\n\nAfter 1989, most Soviet republics and Eastern European countries tried to follow this path. Even Russia did for a time, until it started deviating towards autocracy.\n\nPutin has chafed under NATO's expansion, and he doesn't want former satellites defying Russia's will. When the former Soviet Republic of Georgia got out of line, he didn't hesitate to use military force. When Ukraine looked set to sign an economic agreement with the European Union, Russia warned against the \"suicidal step.\"\n\nRussia's aggressive moves against Ukraine, its repeated  taunts and warnings to other countries, and its muscular military, cyber, and propaganda  moves beyond it's borders have raised alarm, particularly in the Baltic States, which were sold out to the Soviet Union even before Yalta.\n\nJust before Trump took office, NATO deployed forces in Poland to deter Russia. Poland's defense minister declared the move meant that \"Yalta is over.\" But within a week Trump was the new president.\n\nThe fear of a Yalta 2.0 is so palpable that Poland's Foreign Minister traveled to Washington before the inauguration and tried to reassure his people, telling them he spoke with Trump advisors and -- \"there will not be a new Yalta.\"\n\nBut nobody really knows what exactly Trump has in mind -- or how much he knows about the original Yalta and its consequences.\n\nIt's clear what Putin wants. His vision of Yalta 2.0 is an agreement in which Russia regains an old-fashioned sphere of influence, keeping the former Soviet Republics (Russia's \"near abroad\") on a short leash without US or NATO interference, and perhaps extending a version of that power over former Eastern European satellites. He wants NATO to stop expanding and become weaker; he wants the US and NATO and the US to relinquish their protective umbrella over Russia's sphere of influence. He wants the sanctions lifted. He wants the US to recognize Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. In short, he wants the U.S. to turn a blind eye on many of its values, commitments, and international law.\n\nWhat is less clear is what exactly the US would obtain in return. Trump boasts of being a great negotiator, so perhaps he has another \"secret plan,\" but it all remains achingly vague. His recent suggestion that Russia give up some nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting the sanctions indicated he's still trying to figure out what to ask in return. Russia, incidentally, seems uninterested in the disarmament idea. \n\nThe entire Trump-Putin relationship is clouded in controversy. But as far as we can tell Trump wants Russia's cooperation fighting ISIS, which is hardly a concession by Russia since Russia also wants to get rid of ISIS and, in fact, cooperation along those lines was already approved by the US.\n\nThe United States might also receive greater access to Russian natural resources, which would make American companies happy. Russia could presumably also provide backing on other issues, perhaps Iran.  On the whole, however, it looks like a one-sided deal, like the kind Trump criticized Obama for making. \n\nOf the many looming unknowns in Trump presidency, few have the potential to alter the course of history more than a possible Yalta 2.0  ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.5618877410888703, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1018, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.9317300902900003, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6345776031434203, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/01/africa/south-sudan-violence-report/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 508, "scraper_regex": 604}}, "headline": "UN commander fired over peacekeepers' response in South Sudan", "wordcount_as_scraped": 604, "date": "20161101210000", "story_content": "UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has fired the commander of the peacekeeping force in South Sudan saying he is \"deeply distressed\" by the findings of a report on deadly violence in South Sudan's capital in July and the actions of the UN mission in the country.\n\nThe United Nations announced the dismissal of  Lt.

A culture of reporting and acting in silos inhibited effective action during a period in which swift, joint action was essential.Forces did not operate under a unified command, resulting in multiple and sometimes conflicting orders to the four troop contingents from China, Ethiopia, Nepal and India.Peacekeepers were risk-averse.\n\nThe UN mission in Sudan has come under repeated criticism in the past for failing to protect citizens.\n\nDoctors Without Borders criticized the UN mission in February when peacekeepers did not intervene in fighting at a Protection of Civilians Site in Malakal, South Sudan. \n\nSouth Sudan, which gained independence from Sudan in 2011, descended into a two-year civil war in 2013 after Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, accused his vice president, Machar, who is an ethnic Nuer, of plotting a coup.\n\nIn August 2015, the warring parties negotiated a peace deal to establish a national unity government, but that largely disintegrated in July when fighting resumed between forces loyal to Kiir and those of Machar after their security forces engaged in a firefight at the presidential complex. Around 300 people were killed in those clashes.\n\nREAD: South Sudan violence leads 60,000 to flee\n\nSince the July outbreak of violence, around 70,000 South Sudanese people have crossed the border into Uganda as refugees. Since fighting began in December 2013, more than 2 million South Sudanese have fled their homes, according to the United Nations.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.88990831375122, "HarmVice": 15, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 508, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.82589434181, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161101210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 8.07086614173228, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/09/health/organ-donation-2016/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00bd": [5279]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1188, "scraper_regex": 1294}}, "headline": "US organ transplants increased nearly 20% in five years ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1294, "date": "20170109220000", "story_content": "Organ transplants performed in the United States reached a record high during 2016, for the fourth year in a row, according to preliminary data from the United Network for Organ Sharing.\n\nDuring 2016, there were 33,606 transplants, an 8.5% increase over 2015 and up 19.8% since 2012. This growth can be mostly attributed to an expanding number of deceased donors.  \n\nAbout 82% (or 27,628) of the transplants involved organs from deceased donors, who often provide multiple organs. The remaining 18% (or 5,978) were performed with organs from living donors.\n\nThere have been fewer disqualifications of deceased donations over time, explained Dr. David Klassen, chief medical officer of the organ sharing network, which serves under federal contract and brings together medical professionals, transplant recipients and donor families. \n\nNo uniform criteria for donations or enforced guidelines exist across the procurement and donation network, Klassen said. Instead, donation and transplant professionals use their best judgment to evaluate whether each donated organ will be safe for a patient, such as whether an elderly deceased adult would be a safe donor.\n\nAnother source of donor organs is rooted in the opioid epidemic sweeping the nation.\n\n\"The number of donors who died of overdoses increased over the past year,\" Klassen said. The percentage of donors who have died from overdoses is approaching 25% of the donor population in some parts of the country, he said.\n\nIncreased donation as a result of drug overdoses is not a trend anyone wants to see continue, he said but there's still potential for increasing the number of donors. \n\n\"The transplant community is pretty energized in terms of trying to make use of all donors of potential,\" Klassen said.\n\nOne energized member of the community is the New England Organ Bank, which works with over 150 hospitals.\n\n\"In many ways, our results in 2016 mirrored those nationally,\" said Alexandra Glazier, the organ bank's president and CEO. \"We achieved a 19% increase in organ donation.\" She said this was achieved by \"participating in national efforts through organizations like Donate Life America\" while taking the lead in finding donors.\n\n\"In New England, we work closely with the motor vehicle departments in all six states to make it fast and easy for individuals getting or renewing licenses to register as organ and tissue donors,\" Glazier said. \"Another part of our effort is to provide information and support to families of unregistered individuals who have died to offer them the option to make the donation decision.\" \n\nAcross the nation, kidneys are the most commonly demanded and transplanted organ every year, partly because dialysis can prolong the life of people waiting for this organ. In 2016, a total of 19,057 kidney transplants occurred, followed by 7,841 liver transplants, 3,191 heart transplants and 2,327 lung transplants.\n\nCurrently, 119,053 people are waiting for a life-saving organ in the United States. \n\nOne recipient's story\n\nOne grateful recipient, Jay Monahan, 28, received a deceased donor kidney transplant in October. \n\nMonahan, a native of Bedford, Massachusetts, was diagnosed at age 9 with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. MPGN, as it is commonly called, is one of a group of conditions in which the immune system damages the kidney. \n\nFor most patients, the condition can be treated and will continue unchanged for years, though it must be routinely monitored. For some, the condition goes away on its own. However, for other patients, it leads to kidney failure.\n\n\"My kidneys failed very slowly over the course of about 10 years,\" Monahan said. \"I started to get sick when I was a junior in high school. It was fatigue, mostly; I would have days when I couldn't even physically get out of bed.\"\n\nThough he finished high school, \"that was it,\" Monahan said. \"I couldn't go to college. I was too sick.\"\n\n\"I had a transplant when I was 21 from my mom, which only lasted two years, and then I was on dialysis for five years until I got my second transplant in October.\"\n\nThe failure of his first kidney was not entirely unexpected, since close to half the people with MPGN see the disease reoccur in the transplanted kidney within five years. One recent, though small-scale, study found a 45% disease recurrence rate post-transplant. \n\nWhen his first donated organ began to fail, Monahan entered a study for an off-label use of Soliris, a drug that blocks the immune system from attacking the kidney. It seemed to be working, but then the study ended. Within a month, his transplant failed, and he began dialysis while waiting for a second kidney.\n\n\"Dialysis was very difficult,\" Monahan said. For the first four years, he did peritoneal dialysis, in which wastes are removed from the blood by a cleansing fluid. The fluid is washed into and out of a patient's belly in cycles, with the inside lining of the belly acting as a natural filter. \n\n\"I was able to do that at home, and that was every day -- but that wasn't as bad, because I was able to do it while I slept,\" he said. \"And then that eventually stopped working, and I had to switch to hemodialysis for the last eight months, and that was three days a week for 3\u00bd hours.\"\n\nIn hemodialysis, blood is pumped out of a patient's body to an artificial kidney machine and then returned. \n\nAfter his new transplant, Monahan is back on Soliris, and this time he will stay on it \"indefinitely,\" he said. \n\nNot only are his doctors more hopeful, his health has been pretty good. \n\n\"I went back to work within three weeks after the transplant,\" said Monahan, an ice hockey referee. \n\n\"I'm not sure who my donor is, but I'm going to try to find out within a few months,\" he said. He plans to contact the organization that procured his kidney, the New England Organ Bank, which facilitates correspondence between donor families and organ recipients.\n\nThough at first the exchange of notes is anonymous, \"when both recipients and donor families agree, direct contact information can be shared,\" Glazier said. She added that in some cases, patients and donor families do meet. \n\nThough unsure what he will say, Monahan hopes to express his gratitude for the gift. And he's still thankful for his mother's generous donation; her health continues to be \"great,\" even eight years since the procedure, he said.\n\n\"It means a lot that my mom gave me a kidney. I mean, she says it's not a big deal because any parent would do that for a child, but I still think it's a big deal,\" Monahan said. \n\nGoing forward\n\nThe increase in life-saving organ transplants is due in part to improvements made throughout the network, which includes individual organ banks, officially known as organ procurement organizations, and hospitals where transplant surgeries occur.\n\n\"To make it all work takes coordinated effort,\" Klassen said. \n\nCurrently, 58 organ banks of varying size and geographic range operate across the nation, all working toward the same goal.\n\n\"One of the areas we're very interested in is looking at the regulatory and oversight structure that surrounds transplant programs,\" Klassen said. Both the organ donation network and the government itself are \"trying to remove any disincentives that programs have for being able to maximize donor potential.\" He admits, though, that \"those changes could be kind of slow to come.\" \n\nOne such disincentive is that organ procurement organizations are evaluated on various metrics that may be a bit too stringent. One of these metrics is patient and graft survival, said Klassen. Currently, over 95% of patients and about 95% or slightly fewer of transplanted kidneys survive. \n\n \"The results are really excellent,\" Klassen said. \"But there's a perception that the standards are so tight that, in fact, programs become overly caution to the disadvantage of people on the waiting list.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.97597599029541, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1188, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 4, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.21282588612, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170109220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.6936026936026902, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/28/entertainment/debbie-reynolds-obituary/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Debbie Reynolds, 'Singin' in the Rain' star and Carrie Fisher's mom, dies at 84 ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 554, "date": "20161229030000", "story_content": "Debbie Reynolds, the multi-talented actress with a colorful off-screen history who starred in the classic musical \"Singin' in the Rain,\" has died. She was 84.\n\nReynolds' death came one day after that of her daughter, actress and \"Star Wars\" icon Carrie Fisher. In a Facebook post, Reynolds had expressed gratitude for the outpouring of tributes to her \"beloved and amazing daughter.\"\n\nLike Fisher, Reynolds was only 20 when the movie that would define her career made its debut: \"Singin' in the Rain,\" the 1952 musical about the entertainment industry that co-starred Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor.\n\nA host of roles quickly followed, with Reynolds playing opposite Frank Sinatra in \"The Tender Trap\" and Gregory Peck in the star-studded \"How the West Was Won.\"\n\nBorn in El Paso, Texas, as Mary Frances Reynolds, Debbie Reynolds started in beauty pageants before catching the eye of a talent scout while still in her teens. Reynolds was frequently cast in wholesome roles -- she was frequently described as having a \"girl-next-door\" look -- in projects including \"The Singing Nun\" and \"Tammy and the Bachelor.\"\n\nThe latter's title song sung by Reynolds, \"Tammy,\" topped the pop charts. She earned an Oscar nomination in 1964 for another musical, playing the title role in \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown.\" (She later toured in a stage production of that story.)\n\nReynolds remained active well past her heyday in the '50s and '60s, including a flurry of roles in recent years. Those included playing Albert Brooks' mom in the 1996 comedy \"Mother,\" and Liberace's mother in the 2013 HBO movie \"Behind the Candelabra.\"\n\nIn 2001, Reynolds starred in the TV movie \"These Old Broads,\" which was written by Carrie Fisher, alongside Shirley MacLaine and Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nThat pairing was particularly notable, since Reynolds and Taylor had figured in one of the more public scandals of their era, when Reynolds' husband, singer Eddie Fisher, left her for the newly widowed Taylor, grieving over the plane-crash death of her husband, producer Mike Todd. In another footnote, MacLaine had starred as a sort-of version of Reynolds in the movie \"Postcards From the Edge,\" which was adapted from Fisher's semi-autobiographical book about her struggles as an actress.\n\n\"I could understand why he wanted her,\" Reynolds told People magazine about Fisher and Taylor's affair. \"I couldn't understand why she wanted him.\"\n\nAll three of Reynolds' marriages ended in divorce, including her second, to shoe mogul Harry Karl, who gambled away most of the couple's money. Reynolds documented that interlude in one of her several books, a 1988 autobiography titled \"Debbie: My Life.\"\n\nWhen film roles became scarce, Reynolds continued to perform on stage and in nightclubs -- in part out of necessity to restore her depleted finances.\n\nReynolds was honored with the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Humanitarian Award for her work regarding mental health issues, having co-founded a group devoted to it, the Thalians. Earlier that year Reynolds received the Screen Actors Guild's Life Achievement Award.\n\nReflecting on her career at the time, she cited \"Singin' in the Rain\" as her career highlight, telling the Hollywood Reporter, \"It was the era when they would take an unknown girl and make a star of her overnight. I was lucky. God was very good to me.\"\n\nSurvivors include her son, Todd, and her granddaughter Billie Lourd, who is also an actress.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.54668927192688, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 539, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.4770978917500002, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 11, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.04081632653061, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/26/opinions/george-michael-as-a-musician-covach/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Much more than a teen idol -- George Michael the musician", "wordcount_as_scraped": 568, "date": "20161226140000", "story_content": "George Michael was not exactly what he seemed to many of his fans.  Michael, who died on Christmas Day, was of course the charismatic performer with the fantastic voice that propelled \"Wake Me Up Before You Go Go\" to the top of the charts in the US and Britain in 1984. The infectious song, with a Motown-drenched energy, made Wham! (Michael and Andrew Ridgeley) into international stars, as their album \"Make It Big\" raced to the top of the charts, yielding three additional top hit singles.  \n\nConsidering his status at the time as a teen heartthrob, it might surprise some fans to learn that George Michael served as producer of the \"Make It Big\" album and that he also wrote all but one of the songs on that record (the exception being a cover of the Isley Brothers' \"If You Were There\").  \n\nWhile Michael acknowledged an admiration for 1970s bubblegum star David Cassidy, he was also someone who sought to go beyond his celebrity, seeing much more in the music he created than an opportunity to dazzle the masses -- though he was certainly well-equipped to do that.\n\nAfter dissolving Wham!, Michael continued his chart-topping success with a debut solo album.  Released in late 1987, \"Faith\" once again featured Michael's production and songwriting, topping the charts on both sides of the Atlantic and containing six top-5 hit singles.  \n\nWhile many will remember the controversial \"I Want Your Sex\" and the catchy \"Faith\", other singles revealed something of Michael's stylistic range as a performer.  \"One More Try\" seems influenced by the gospel-tinged expressive soul ballads of Otis Redding, while \"Kissing a Fool\" evokes the R&B styles of Sam Cooke and Smokey Robinson.\n\nViewed from an American perspective, Wham! in the mid-1980s seemed to have a lot in common with Hall and Oates, who had been enjoying the success of their blue-eyed soul since \"Sara Smile\" in 1976.  And the catchiest of Michael's up-tempo hits clearly share a lot with Prince's music: \"I Want Your Sex\" seems to owe something to \"Lady Cab Driver.\"  \n\nIn fact, the comparison with Prince is most apt: both musicians wrote, produced, and performed their music, frequently playing the other parts as well.\n\nPop-music historians tend to focus on an artist's first years of significant impact, and for George Michael it will be the late 1980s, when \"Make It Big\" and \"Faith\" topped the charts. Michael's follow-up to \"Faith\" was \"Listening Without Prejudice Vol. 1\", released in 1990 in a clear effort to move in a more serious songwriting direction.  This shift was better received in the UK than the US, though the album reached the number-two chart position in the States.  \n\nStill, the enormity of Michael's previous commercial success sealed his fate in terms of history: for most fans he will always be defined as the buoyant singer of \"Wake Me Up Before You Go Go\" and \"Faith.\"  Scholars will likely also note that he was an exceptional musician, producer, and songwriter.\n\nIn the first shot of the official video for \"Wake Me Up\", a youthful George Michael appears dancing in a white shirt and pants. On his shirt is written in big letters: \"Choose life.\"  As we remember him in the wake of his passing, I have a sense he would encourage us to focus on the joy and celebration that were so often an integral part of his music.

I felt very inadequate; I felt like I'd made the worst decision of my life,\" the star said of the birth of her son, Angelo, now 4. \n\nBorn Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, the 28-year-old has won 10 Grammys as well as an Oscar for the title song from the James Bond film \"Skyfall.\"\n\n\"You can't talk about the downside of fame, because people have hope, and they cling to the hope of what it would be like to be famous, to be adored, to be able to create and do nice things,\" she told Vanity Fair. \n\nThe singer and Angelo's dad, Simon Konecki, her boyfriend of the past five years, also co-parent his daughter from a previous marriage.\n\nInadequacy following birth\n\n\"My knowledge of postpartum -- or post-natal, as we call it in England -- is that you don't want to be with your child,\" Adele tells Vanity Fair. \"You're worried you might hurt your child; you're worried you weren't doing a good job.\" \n\nAccording to the magazine, she struggled with these feelings of inadequacy for a time after giving birth to Angelo.\n\n\"I had really bad postpartum depression after I had my son, and it frightened me,\" she said. \"I didn't talk to anyone about it. I was very reluctant.\" \n\nThough Konecki suggested she confide in other women, Adele initially refused. Still, she found herself \"gravitating towards pregnant women and other women with children, because I found they're a bit more patient.\"\n\nShe did not take antidepressants for her condition, instead finding help by talking about her feelings with other women. \"Four of my friends felt the same way I did, and everyone was too embarrassed to talk about it.\"\n\n\"Eventually, I just said, I'm going to give myself an afternoon a week, just to do whatever the f**k I want without my baby,\" Adele said. Though questioned by her friends, she did it anyway. \n\n\"They thought everyone would think they were a bad mom, and it's not the case. It makes you a better mom if you give yourself a better time.\"\n\nAdele also acknowledges that she's \"very available to depression\" and can slip in and out of the dark mood quite easily.\n\n\"The music I've always been drawn to is sad. I've always been pretty melancholy. Obviously not as much in my real life as the songs are, but I have a very dark side,\" she told Vanity Fair. \"It started when my granddad died, when I was about 10, and while I never had a suicidal thought, I have been in therapy, lots.\n\n\"One day I said to a friend, 'I f**kin' hate this,' and she just burst into tears and said, 'I f**kin' hate this, too.' And it was done. It lifted,\" Adele said, adding that she hasn't felt so poorly since she \"snapped out of\" her postpartum depression. \n\nPerinatal depression and anxiety disorder\n\nAmong professionals, the term for Adele's experience is \"perinatal mood disorder\" or \"perinatal depression and anxiety disorders.\"\n\n\"Perinatal\" means \"during pregnancy,\" explained Susan Feingold, a Chicago-based psychologist who specializes in postpartum depression and women's issues. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 800,000 to 950,000 women experience perinatal depression and anxiety disorder each year: about one in seven mothers.\n\nNot all women feel depressed, and for some patients, the condition begins during pregnancy, not after birth.\n\n\"It presents as a very anxious depression, and some women don't get depressed, so they don't get red-flagged as having the problem,\" said Feingold, author of \"Happy Endings, New Beginnings,\" a book about the topic.\n\nExperts are quick to point out that perinatal mood disorders are different from \"baby blues.\" \n\n\"Eighty percent of all women have the baby blues,\" said Ann Smith, president of Postpartum Support International, a nonprofit that connects women with those who can help. \n\nThe birth of a baby, Smith explained, is a very emotional time, and a mother may feel up and down, with \"completely unstable\" emotions. This can go on for the first two weeks after birth. But the definition of it is that \"it goes away,\" she said. \n\nUnlike the baby blues, a perinatal depression and anxiety disorder \"not only doesn't go away, it probably gets worse,\" Smith said, adding that the mom begins to \"really have trouble getting from day to day.\"\n\nDistinct subtypes\n\nSymptoms can fall into four clusters, or subtypes, according to Feingold. One subtype is depression, which includes the loss of joy, and \"life feels flat and gray and dark,\" she said. Another subtype is anxiety and symptoms including irritability and anger. A third involves panic attacks, which may include difficulty breathing and feeling disconnected. \n\nThe fourth subtype is obsessive-compulsive disorder, which comes with horrible thoughts that seem to come out of nowhere, according to Feingold. In some cases, a mother might imagine  she is going to stab her baby. Suffering mothers might have such sudden thoughts and then feel very distressed.\n\n\"It's a good sign they're distressed,\" she said, adding that this distress means they are not suffering from postpartum psychosis, a different and very rare condition. \n\nStill, the mother who develops obsessive-compulsive disorder may distance herself from her baby  to protect the child. \n\n\"They think they're going crazy,\" Feingold said, adding that women are also afraid that if they talk to someone about it, their baby might be taken away. \"It's a very secretive piece, and it can go along with depression and anxiety, but it's not so uncommon.\"\n\nOrigins and treatment\n\nAccording to Smith, the cause of perinatal mood disorders is believed to be \"something to do with the upheaval of hormones that take place during pregnancy and immediately after birth that throw off the neurotransmitters in the brain.\"\n\nYet, there's hopeful news, Smith said: \"Everybody can get better. ... This is not a death sentence or life sentence to mental illness or feeling terrible.\" \n\nAccording to Feingold, the \"sooner you're treated, the better.\" She compared it to a bad virus that needs to be taken care of right away.\n\n\"I set up an individual plan for each woman,\" Feingold said.

The former New York City mayor also sought to rebut critics who say that his consulting and speeches make his attacks on the Clinton Foundation during the presidential campaign hypocritical.\n\n\"What I did violated no laws, no regulations,\" Giuliani said. \"It was a perfectly legal, lawful, thing to do. And also these comparisons to Hillary Clinton are nuts because I was in private business. I was not\u2014there's no conflict with anything. I'm not a government official. I'm in private business. And finally, I wasn't selling influence. I was selling my expertise. And the services of my company. \n\nGiuliani contacted CNN in response to a story by CNN's KFile about his 2012 work consulting with Serbian politicians once tied to convicted war criminal Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Giuliani said he was providing development advice to the city of Belgrade. In interviews at the time, Giuliani said he was there \"to give advice\" to Aleksandar Vucic, now the Serbian prime minister, who was running for mayor at the time. Giuliani said that he was paid by a London company involved in putting together a plan for economic development in Belgrade. Press reports at the time cited Vucic saying he had invited Giuliani to advise him. \n\nIn the interview Friday, Giuliani said that he was invited by the London company and that his team had assessed the offer and determined that they could provide useful advice to the city. He also defended the content of his consultation. \n\n\"I didn't go in there and give a public relations address,\" he said. \"I went there and gave a highly substantive speech on what happens to be one of the areas of knowledge which is perfectly lawful. I don't know what it is that I did wrong. Or how you can paint it is as wrong.\"\n\n\"I conducted myself in a very honorable way. Including a somewhat courageous way, to add, yeah, 'I think you should've been bombed,'\" Giuliani also said, referring to NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. \"How many people go to a city and say, 'I think it was okay you were bombed. You know how often I've done that?\"\n\nGiuliani further cited his relationship with Viktor Yushchenko, the former Ukrainian president and foe of Vladimir Putin who was poisoned in 2004. He said that when he went to Ukraine, he was told that he couldn't meet with Yushchenko (Giuliani misspoke and said he couldn't meet with Viktor Yanukovych, another former Ukrainian president and a Putin ally, but described him in the interview as \"the Viktor that Putin poisoned or allegedly poisoned\"). The former mayor said that he met with Yushchenko anyway.  \n\n\"I said, 'F*ck you, I'll meet with him,'\" he said. \"And I did. And they took away my security and almost didn't let me out the country. And that's before the poor man was poisoned. He and his wife have become good friends of mine. And what I am upset about is the attacks on my reputation.\"\n\nIn the conversation, Giuliani often returned to the idea that his work gave him foreign policy knowledge that would be valuable if Trump picks him as secretary of state, arguing that he is being unfairly \"hit on both ends,\" referring to critics who say he lacks experience and those who say he may be hampered by conflicts of interest. \n\n\"I know all these governments,\" Giuliani said. \"I know the good parts and the bad parts. When I go, I often meet with the prime minister, if I don't meet with the prime minister I always meet with the interior minister and almost always with the defense minister. They want my advice, because I have substantive expertise. They don't want my influence, nor did they try to ask me to influence President Obama which would be ridiculous of course or even President Bush. I'm not seen that way. I'm not seen as a lobbyist, government influencer. I am seen around the world as an expert on crime reduction, city development, and in a different part of my life an expert on securities law. I don't mean securities securities, I mean financial securities law.\"\n\nGiuliani went on to describe coverage of his consulting work as \"totally, totally and completely unfair and without any description of what I actually do.\" \n\n\"They make try to make it sound like I'm a world traveling lobbyist and what I am is a world traveling expert of crime reduction, terrorism, economic development and various aspects of international law and American law that is now becoming international law,\" he said.\n\nGiuliani defended his work for Middle Eastern countries like Qatar, which he said was a staunch ally of the United States at the time and claimed that he never worked for Saudi Arabia, which his former law firm Bracewell and Giuliani represented in Texas court cases. Giuliani left that firm in January. \n\n\"I let the State Department know that I was doing it,\" he said of his work for Qatar. \"They were supportive of it. I got paid for services. I did that in the best interests of my country. It was a different Qatar then, that was completely allied with the United States in the war against Iraq.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.974658846855164, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 934, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.56753034006, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 44, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161118230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.0, "FairnessVice": 2, "MoralityGenera": 7, "pct_mft_words": 4.710920770877941, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/homepage2/nypd-sikh-officers-turbans-policy-change/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "NYPD changes policy, will allow officers to wear turbans", "wordcount_as_scraped": 819, "date": "20161229060000", "story_content": "Sikh officers can now wear full turbans in the New York Police Department. \n\nNYPD Commissioner James O'Neill announced the policy change Wednesday, flanked by officers in navy blue turbans fastened with police brass. \n\n\"We want to make the NYPD as diverse as possible, and I think this is going to go a long way to help us with that,\" O'Neill said. \n\n\"It's a major change in our uniform policy, so we had to go about it carefully. And now I have the opportunity to make the change, and I thought it was about time that we did that.\" \n\nWhile the NYPD patrol guide maintains a strict policy regarding head coverings, officers will now be able to wear turbans with a religious exemption signed by top department officials, O'Neill said.\n\nThere are about 160 Sikh officers in the NYPD, the commissioner said.\n\nBefore the policy change, Sikh officers could wear a smaller wrap, known as a patka, beneath their official police cap, said Gurvinder Singh, an NYPD officer and president of the national Sikh Officers Association.\n\n\"Now I'll be able to serve with my full turban on. It's a great feeling,\" he said. \n\n\"There will be a lot more Sikh officers now taking the next exam.\" \n\nFacial hair still an issue\n\nThe NYPD also announced Wednesday a religious accommodation allowing for officers to, with approval, grow a beard up to half an inch long. The previous policy had allowed for beards of up to a millimeter in length.\n\nSome leaders in the Sikh community applauded the policy change on turbans, but said the NYPD needed to go further with the policy on facial hair. \n\n\"While it's definitely a great step, we look forward to reviewing the policy in depth and ensuring that Sikhs can serve with their turban and beards intact and with no limitations or restrictions to either,\" said Kavneet Singh, a board member of the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n\nThe turban and the practice of keeping a beard or unshorn hair, known as kesh, are among the articles of faith maintained by Sikhs. \n\nOver the summer, the NYPD was sued by a Muslim officer, Masood Syed, who said he was suspended, stripped of his badge and gun for wearing a beard longer than protocol. \n\nSyed, who lives in Queens, was later reinstated after receiving a temporary restraining order from a Manhattan federal judge, though his case remains open. The class-action suit calls the limitation unconstitutional and Syed is seeking a policy allowing for a 2-inch beard -- long enough to comply with religious doctrine. \n\nIn an interview, Syed called Wednesday's announcement \"arbitrary\" and a \"disappointment.\"\n\n\"I'm still disappointed. If they're saying now that the policy is half an inch and I'm walking around in police headquarters with the top brass, walking around with a beard that's 1 1/2 to 2 inches, where does that leave me? Am I going to be suspended again? Am I going to be walked out of the building again?\" Syed said. \n\nSyed, a lawyer and 10-year veteran of the NYPD, added: \"It's not just for Muslims. We have Sikh officers, we have Jewish officers, we have Israelite officers, who all believe that the beard length should be longer than half an inch, who have all approached me and asked me to represent them and submitted their name in support of this policy. For me, it's important because of my faith and my religion, but it's also important for me to represent those other officers.\"\n\nThe NYPD would not comment Wednesday evening on the ongoing lawsuit. \n\nSimilar police policies rare\n\nOnly about a half dozen police forces across the country have explicit accommodations to allow for Sikhs to serve with a turban and beard, according to SALDEF.\n\nWashington DC's Metropolitan Police Department became the first major force in the country to enact such a policy in 2012, though no Sikhs currently serve there, Singh said. \n\nThe NYPD's new policy follows similar ones in Harris County, Texas -- which includes the city of Houston -- and Riverside, California. Singh said both those forces' policies go further than the NYPD's to allow for full beards. \n\nThe NYPD had previously prohibited beards because they interfere with certain gas masks. \n\nHuge and diverse police department\n\nAs the largest police force in the country, the NYPD has long prided itself on being one of the most diverse.\n\nAbout 900 Muslim Americans serve in the NYPD, city officials have said. Female Muslim officers have for years been able to receive a religious exemption allowing them to wear head scarves, according to Lt. Adeel Rana, president of the NYPD's Muslim Officers Society.\n\nThe policy announcement Wednesday followed a graduation ceremony held at Madison Square Garden that saw over 550 men and women sworn in as New York City police officers. \n\nOf the graduating class, 48% of the officers are white, 26% Hispanic, 12% black, and more than 13% Asian, police said.

The answer is murky", "wordcount_as_scraped": 777, "date": "20161118120000", "story_content": "Reformers elated by President-elect Donald Trump's new tough ban on lobbying after serving in his administration can just as quickly find a reason to be disappointed.\n\nThat's because they've heard and seen this before.\n\n\"I am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in Washington are over,\" then-Sen. Barack Obama said in November 2007. His administration put a two-year ban on lobbying post-service.\n\nIn 2016, Trump channeled the same anger against Washington and is proposing to build on the same policies Obama instituted. \n\n\"Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose the Trump campaign. That's because I don't need them. I don't want them. I'm going to do what's good for you,\" Trump said in Akron, Ohio, in August. \"Or some big-time lobbyist says they oppose Donald Trump's campaign. Because I don't want the lobbyists. I've had plenty of lobbyists. They do a good job. They give you whatever you want. I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.\"\n\nThe announcement the President-elect would ban administration officials from returning to lobbying for five years after they leave government sent shockwaves through the influence industry on Thursday, even if the exact definition of \"lobbyist\" wasn't given.\n\nThe move, along with a lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign governments, immediately introduces another disincentive for an administration already struggling to retain top talent and raises the prospect of a vibrant lobbying industry that hums along as well as ever \u2014 but underground and hidden from disclosure, not eradicated.\n\nThe chaser: as under Obama, the swamp need not be drained, merely sprayed with Febreze.\n\n\"The swamp is so deep in Washington that simply saying that there are some people who can have jobs in the administration but can't cash in for five years is such a weak response to the pretty significant message that America just delivered last week,\" said David Donnelly of Every Voice, one of the many good-government groups split by the new Trump guidelines. \"If this is the only thing he did, they will see that nothing has changed.\"\n\nTransition officials said Wednesday that they would expand upon Obama's executive order which forbid administration officials from registering as lobbyists for two years after serving him, a rule that many influence-peddlers today say has done little to actually curb ethics breaches or impact K Street. The Trump aides added Thursday that the new policy would apply to officials looking to work for overseas governments, too, for their entire lives.\n\nYet the worry among lobbying officials on Thursday wasn't that they would suddenly be out of a line of work. The five-year ban would merely redouble their resourcefulness as they search for workarounds that allow them to not technically classify as \"lobbyists\" once leaving the administration but rather to occupy some other very similar role in Washington officialdom.\n\n\"People will escape: 'I'm a grassroots person.' 'I'm a digital person.' 'I'm this or that.' But you're actually doing the same thing I'm doing,\" said Paul Miller, a leader for a Washington lobbying trade group. \"If you implement this, you're going to have a chilling effect.\"\n\nMiller said he was already fielding conversations on Thursday from concerned lobbyists worried about the emergence of a \"shadow lobbying community\" that operates free from disclosure laws meant to shine a spotlight on how influence is created and wielded in Washington. Miller said he had contacted Trump Tower on behalf of the lobbying industry but had not fetched a response.\n\nHe chalked the move up to pure politics.\n\n\"I have to question the motives. You had a campaign that at the 11th hour in October decided to pull out ethics reform,\" Miller argued, who said his worries spiked this week when the transition team purged its corps of lobbyists, even though they sorely needed the experience. \"You better not be skeptical. You better take this as a real threat \u2014 not just this. We are a target.\"\n\nQuestions remain outstanding: How will officials enforce a five-year-ban that theoretically could outlast a one-term president? Will the administration monitor and penalize lobbyists who de-register in order to avoid the stricter guidelines? And how will Trump learn from Obama, who came into Washington preaching hope and change but largely disappointed ethics-reformers who dreamed of a gridlock-free government?\n\n\"They were worthy of praise, but at the same time it became pretty apparent over the next eight years that there were big holes,\" said Paul Ryan, a prominent Washington ethics reformer, of the Obama platform points. \"I would not call this cosmetic.

A White House statement on Tuesday said her prison sentence is set to expire on May 17.\n\nGreenwald: Obama will not pardon Snowden\n\nThe material, which WikiLeaks published in 2010, included a classified video of a US helicopter attacking civilians and journalists in Iraq in 2007. Labeled \"Collateral Murder,\" the film drew criticism from human rights activists for the deaths of innocent people.\n\nThough found guilty on 20 out of 22 possible charges (including violating the US Espionage Act), Manning was not convicted of the most serious one; aiding the enemy, which could have earned the private a life sentence.\n\nInstead, the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to prison, as well as demoted from private first class to private and dishonorably discharged.\n\nNancy Hollander, an attorney for Manning, told CNN the former soldier has been \"nervous the last few days\" as she waited for word in the closing days of the Obama administration. Hollander said she only learned of the commutation around the time Obama made the announcement.\n\n\"She knows she's going to be free,\" Hollander said. \"She can start her life.\"\n\nWhite House: No Snowden clemency request\n\nSurprise decision\n\nAsked to describe the difference between the situations of Manning and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who is living in exile in Russia after leaking state secrets, a source with knowledge of the White House's thinking said there was a \"fundamental difference\" between the two.\n\nSnowden, the source said, \"dodged blame, fled the country and is hiding from prosecution,\" whereas Manning admitted guilt without a deal and eventually confessed.\n\n\"She went through the process, acknowledged she had done something wrong. She was tried and sentenced,\" the source said.\n\nThe White House is aware that the intelligence community and the Pentagon may be dismayed by the decision, but, the source added, this \"doesn't set a precedent if you consider the distinction between the two of them to be material.\"\n\nPart of the thinking was that Manning's term was quite \"extreme\" and \"without historical precedent\" and she had already served more than six years, the source said, adding that another factor is the personal and emotional side of the Manning story: she is transgender, in a male prison, \"facing an uncertain fate behind bars.\"\n\nSnowden tweeted his support of Manning Tuesday, urging her to \"stay strong a while longer.\"\n\nLet it be said here in earnest, with good heart: Thanks, Obama. https://t.co/IeumTasRNN\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) January 17, 2017\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump did not immediately comment on the matter, but when asked about WikiLeaks in the wake of the releases in 2010, he told Fox News' Brian Kilmeade: \"I think it's disgraceful. I think there should be like death penalty or something.\"\n\nWikiLeaks declares 'victory'\n\nEarlier this month, WikiLeaks said it would agree to a US extradition request for the site's founder, Julian Assange, if Obama granted clemency to Manning. It was not immediately clear if WikiLeaks would make good on its promise, though the group declared \"victory\" in a tweet Tuesday afternoon.\n\nA senior administration official insisted Tuesday that Obama's decision \"was not influenced in any way by public comments by Mr. Assange or the WikiLeaks organization.\"\n\nChase Strangio, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented Manning, said he was \"relieved and thankful\" Obama commuted her sentence, and Amnesty International also cheered news of Manning's commutation.\n\n\"Chelsea Manning exposed serious abuses, and as a result, her own human rights have been violated by the US government for years,\" Margaret Huang, the group's executive director, said in a statement. \"President Obama was right to commute her sentence, but it is long overdue. It is unconscionable that she languished in prison for years while those allegedly implicated by the information she revealed still haven't been brought to justice.\"\n\nRepublican members of Congress, however, expressed outrage.\n\n\"This was grave harm to our national security. and Chelsea Manning is serving a sentence and should continue to serve that sentence,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, denouncing Manning's \"treachery,\" said on Twitter that she \"put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation's most sensitive secrets.\"\n\nAnd South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN that Manning \"stabbed his fellow soldiers in the back\" and Obama \"slapped all those who serve honorably in the face.\"\n\nTwo-year sentence sought for Cartwright\n\nCartwright's career was marked by decades of distinguished military service. From August 2007 to August 2011, he served as the second-highest uniformed officer and, before that, he served as commander of US Strategic Command. During his tenure in these posts, he held the highest security clearance, and retained top security clearance upon his retirement from the military in 2011.\n\nThe senior administration official said Cartwright's motive mattered in Obama's decision to pardon him, calling it \"different than most people who leak info to journalists.\"\n\n\"We are deeply grateful for President Obama's decision to pardon General Cartwright. ... Current and former leaders of the American national security community have, almost with one voice, stood up for General Cartwright. We thank them for supporting a man who is truly one of our nation's heroes,\" Cartwright's attorney and former White House counsel, Gregory Craig, said in a statement.\n\nFederal prosecutors had sought a two-year prison sentence for Cartwright in court filings earlier this month, but his attorneys asked for probation, emphasizing his desire to persuade journalists to modify their reporting to protect national security interests.\n\n\"General Cartwright understands the magnitude of his offense and deeply regrets the decision that he made ... He has accepted responsibility and acknowledged his guilt,\" his attorneys wrote in court papers. \n\n\"(I)n General Cartwright's communications with both journalists, he successfully persuaded them not to report information that would be harmful to the United States.\"\n\nOne of those reporters, David Sanger of The New York Times, submitted a letter in support of Cartwright explaining that \"throughout the interview, (Cartwright) consistently showed his concern that information damaging to US interests not be made public.\"\n\nThe other reporter, Daniel Klaidman, who wrote for Newsweek, also submitted a letter on Cartwright's behalf, as did several current and former members of Congress, along with military officials from the Bush and Obama administrations, all urging the judge for leniency in light of Cartwright's decorated military career.\n\nCartwright, 67, served 40 years in the US Marine Corps and was widely regarded within the military for his technical acumen and work in the areas of nuclear proliferation, missile defense and cybersecurity.\n\nHe was scheduled for sentencing before DC District Court Judge Richard Leon on January 31.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.6974790096283, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 547, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.6006197147, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.47349177330896, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/politics/sutter-trump-environmentalist/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1465, "scraper_regex": 1689}}, "headline": "Donald Trump, environmentalist?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1689, "date": "20170126140000", "story_content": "President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise of gutting US environmental regulations. On week one of his presidency, it's clear he plans to follow through.  \n\nAmong the moves Trump made by Wednesday evening: The new administration pushed forward the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, promoted a return to the dirty fossil-fuel era with a proposed \"America First Energy Plan,\" removed references to climate change from the White House website, proposed massive cuts to climate change programs, and instituted an \"unprecedented\" media blackout at the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIs this the work of America's new environmentalist in chief? \n\nThat's apparently how the President sees it.\n\n\"I'm a very big person when it comes to the environment,\" Trump told business leaders on Monday. \"I've received awards on the environment.\"\n\nTo better understand the first claim, I called up a few environmentalists. \n\n\"You have to laugh,\" said Tim Donaghy, a senior researcher at Greenpeace USA. \"I guess you laugh or you cry.\" \n\n\"It's shocking. It's appalling,\" said Bob Deans, director of strategic engagement at the Natural Resources Defense Council, or NRDC. \"We heard him say in front of campaign rallies that climate change is a hoax. It's not a hoax. It's the essential environmental challenge of our time, and it's a threat to our children's future.\"\n\n\"Good! I'm glad he is (saying he's an environmentalist), and I look forward to some positive changes,\" said Jim Brainard, the Republican mayor of Carmel, Indiana, who has worked to curb his city's carbon pollution.\n\nHe added, \"I say that somewhat sarcastically.\" \n\nThe environmental movement seems less interested in what Trump is saying than what he's doing. \n\nTo that end, here are five ways Trump might actually earn the title of 2017 environmentalist. \n\n1. Lead the global transition away from fossil fuels\n\nThere's some inflexible math behind climate change, and one of the most important numbers to know is this: zero. To avoid the most catastrophic effects of global warming -- super droughts, drowned coastal cities, climate refugees, mass extinction in the natural world and stronger storms --  world leaders, as part of the Paris Climate agreement, agreed to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero. And they said we'd do it this century. \n\nThat basically means no fossil fuels, and drastic changes to the way we use land -- far less tropical deforestation, for instance -- as well as possible technological efforts to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. \n\nA zero-carbon energy policy looks nothing like what Trump has proposed. \n\n\"We must take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own,\" the White House's \"America First Energy Plan\" reads, citing a figure some academics say mischaracterizes the value of the reserves. \"The Trump administration is also committed to clean coal technology, and to reviving America's coal industry. ...\" \n\nOil, gas and coal are, of course, fossil fuels, with coal being the dirtiest of them. And the world can't burn much more of those if we want to have any reasonable hope of meeting the terms of the Paris Agreement. Only 5% of US coal reserves can be burned by 2050 if we hope to meet that goal, according to an analysis published in 2015 in the journal Nature. (That figure assumes we don't develop technology to capture and store carbon pollution on a large scale. Even if we do, only 8% of US coal can be burned, meaning almost all of it stays in the ground.)\n\n\"If Trump wants to be an environmentalist, he'd need to say no to dirty fossil fuel projects like Dakota Access and Keystone XL and drive forward a clean energy revolution in this country and around the world,\" said Jamie Henn, co-founder of the climate advocacy group 350.org. \n\n2. Harness the real job-creator: clean energy\n\nTrump is all about jobs. But by focusing attention on bringing back fossil fuel jobs, he's missing an opportunity to create more numerous and lasting jobs in the clean energy sector, according to environmentalists. \n\nStrikingly, there are more US jobs in solar energy alone than in either oil-and-gas extraction or coal mining, according to a 2016 report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, or IRENA. \"Jobs in the solar industry grew 12 times as fast as overall job creation in the US economy,\" the report says. The country's 209,000 solar industry jobs in 2015 outnumber those in oil and gas extraction -- 187,200 -- and coal mining -- 67,929. \n\nThe group estimates renewable energy industries employed 769,000 in the United States in 2015. \n\nComparing jobs numbers across industries can be somewhat difficult. There are farther-reaching estimates for the total number of clean-energy or \"green\" jobs in the United States, for instance. But it's clear to environmentalists that clean-energy researchers, wind farm technicians and solar panel manufacturers will outlast fossil fuel jobs.\n\n\"If jobs and energy independence are really what this administration cares about, wind, solar and other renewable energy resources are the future,\" said Doug Hayes, staff attorney for the Sierra Club.\n\n3. Take some pointers from -- China? \n\nThe world's two biggest annual climate polluters -- the United States and China -- pushed forward the Paris Agreement on climate. But as the United States seems interested in \"anchoring our future in the dirty fuels of the past,\" said Deans, from the NRDC, China is emerging as the political and technological leader on climate change. \n\n\"The world has looked to the United States for climate and energy leadership,\" Deans said. \"If we're going to go backward\" in the United States, then \"that leadership is going to come from, likely, China.\"\n\nClimate and energy news has looked quite different in China in recent weeks than in the United States. China has canceled the construction of more than 100 planned coal-fired power plants. The country plans to introduce a nationwide carbon market this year -- which is the sort of policy tool that, along with carbon taxes, many economists see as a holy grail for climate regulation. And China announced it will invest about $360 billion on renewable energy projects by 2020. \"Today, we are facing climate change, and we know this is caused by our use of energy,\" Nur Bekri, China's energy minister, said this month, according to The New York Times. \"That is why the Chinese government attaches great importance to the development of clean energy.\"\n\n\"The Paris Agreement is a hard-won achievement which is in keeping with the underlying trend of global development,\" China President Xi Jinping, said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"All signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations.\"\n\nTrump has threatened to pull the United States out of that process. Even if he doesn't, some environmentalists fear he will work to undermine the Paris Agreement's goal of a carbon neutral world.  \n\n\"Withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement would be bad for the environment,\" said Sam Adams, US director of the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit that focuses on policy and research. \"There would be collateral costs to the United States standing against the world. ... Other nations, like China, have just in the last days been stepping up -- announcing new investments in their own domestic climate action and clean energy sectors.\"\n\n4. Recognize the costs of coal and carbon \n\nTrump is a business guy, but environmentalists -- and environmental economists -- say he fails to understand the expensive consequences of burning fossil fuels and allowing climate change to run amok. \n\n(For the record: 97% of climate scientists agree the world is warming and humans are to blame because of pollution. Humanity's role in climate change is not up for scientific debate, despite what Trump and some of his Cabinet picks say.)\n\nThere are two points environmentalists have been making here: First is that coal, in particular, is a dirty, deadly fuel. The Clean Air Task force, a nonprofit dedicated to improving air quality, estimated in 2010 that pollution from coal power plants contributes to 13,200 premature deaths, 9,700 hospitalizations and more than 20,000 heart attacks in the United States per year. The World Health Organization says outdoor air pollution is linked to 3 million deaths per year worldwide. Coal, along with gasoline and other fossil fuel pollution, contribute significantly.\n\nSecond is that the costs of doing nothing about climate change are significant.\n\n\"Within the next 15 years, higher sea levels combined with storm surge will likely increase the average annual cost of coastal storms along the Eastern Seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico by $2 billion to $3.5 billion,\" found a 2014 report from the Risky Business Project, led by Michael Bloomberg, Henry Paulson and Tom Steyer. \"Adding in potential changes in hurricane activity, the likely increase in average annual losses grows to up to $7.3 billion, bringing the total annual price tag for hurricanes and other coastal storms to $35 billion.\"\n\n5. Make US infrastructure climate-friendly\n\nFinally, both US political parties are talking about infrastructure. \n\nBut what does that infrastructure look like? It matters to environmentalists, who want to see infrastructure spending include energy-saving projects like public transportation, bus routes, bike lanes, building weatherization and updates to the smart electricity grid to support renewable energy development. What we build now has consequences for years, if not decades, into the future. And environmentalists want to see the United States position itself to use less dirty fossil fuel energy, to boost its efficiency and to create clean-energy jobs. \n\n\"For more than a century -- back to Teddy Roosevelt -- the idea of leaving our children a livable world has been a bipartisan goal,\" said Deans, from NRDC. \"It's an American value. It's only recently, since 2010, I would say, that we have seen one party doing everything it can to unwind generations of bipartisan progress.\" \n\n\"What Donald Trump could do,\" he added, \"would be to build on that legacy of bipartisan stewardship and not try to tear it apart.\"\n\nEnvironmentalists aren't holding their breath for for that to happen.\n\nThey're planning ways to push back.\n\nIncluding an April 29 march on Washington organized by the People's Climate Movement.

But I remember.  \n\nIt was a Sunday afternoon, my senior year in high school. My parents and I gathered around the radio, an old Philco with the arched top, listening to the stunning news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\nI think my father was listening to the radio when the station broke in with the news. My mother was probably in the kitchen after Sunday dinner. I was in my room doing homework when they called to me. What I remember -- clearly, vividly, testify-to-it-in-court -- is the three of us huddled around the radio, trying to take it in. The bolt-from-the-blue event, comparable in our time only to 9/11, that would change life as we knew it.\n\nWar was nothing new. But it was always somewhere else, somebody else.\n\nI'd listened to the radio when Poland was invaded. Paris occupied. Dunkirk evacuated. Edward R. Murrow reported from London, bombs falling in the distance. Now they'd fallen on US Navy ships in a place I'd never heard of.\n\nThe next day at school we were all buzzing about it. Someone said, and everyone picked it up: \"America has never lost a war.\" When we walked into American history class after lunch, our teacher said, \"Neither has Japan.\"\n\nIt was in that history class I heard President Franklin D. Roosevelt's address to a joint session of the US Congress when our school P.A. system piped it into classrooms. The President was asking for a declaration of war, declaring the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, \"a date which will live in infamy.\"\n\nSeveral years later, on a visit to Washington, I went to the National Archives. Up the marble stairway, past the framed copies of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, the walls of the second floor were covered with documents in narrow black frames. I stopped at the typed text of President Roosevelt's speech to Congress that day. I noticed the text said \"a date which will live in history.\" History had been crossed out, a word penciled in above: infamy.\n\nAccording to a one-page, historical footnote by former Times Executive Editor Max Frankel in The New York Times Magazine years later, President Roosevelt had dictated the speech but then felt \"history\" did not cover the treachery, the heinous nature of the surprise attack.  \n\nInfamy does better convey the deed, and toll.\n\nThe Japanese attack destroyed or damaged 19 US Navy ships, including eight battleships. It killed 2,403 Americans and wounded 1,178. Civilians weren't spared, either -- 68 were killed.\n\nNot that any of these figures were released at the time -- valuable intelligence for the enemy, impact on morale on the home front.\n\nYears later, I chanced upon a fact that is the one I remember today. The seemingly small detail that lingers. A comment by the legendary Chicago Daily News foreign correspondent Robert J. Casey, whom I had the pleasure of knowing when I was at the Daily News. Casey, who had been covering the war in Europe -- the Fall of France, Battle of Britain and London Blitz -- had turned his professional attention to the Pacific. When he arrived in Pearl Harbor shortly before Christmas (I think I read this in a Daily News Alumni newsletter), he said the smell of burning oil and rubber was still in the air.  \n\nThat Christmas, I was trying, as was everyone, to cope with the news of another loss -- Wake Island, December 23.  Then Manila.  \n\nThe only good news for months came with the Doolittle Raid, April 18, 1942. Sixteen B-25 bombers under the command of Lt. Col. James \"Jimmy\" Doolittle took off from the USS Hornet aircraft carrier to take the war to the Japanese, bombing Tokyo and military targets in Japan.\n\nOne hooray! yahoo! hallelujah! moment in the long dark months.\n\nBataan fell April 9. Corregidor May 6.\n\nIn one of those twists of fate encountered in novels rather than our own lives, the morning of February 1, 1945, when I arrived for work at the Chicago Daily News -- I was a copygirl then -- I was told not to go to my usual post, but to a desk where I would receive the names of the men who had just been freed from a Japanese prisoner of war camp, the men taken prisoner when Bataan and Corregidor fell. The names were being released as they were obtained and needed to be put in alphabetical order. I cut The Associated Press copy into strips and put the names in order. All morning and well into the afternoon. On my way home that night, I read The Associated Press story on the men rescued, the first glimpse of the horrors of the Bataan Death March.\n\nWhen a copyboy dropped off copies of the latest edition at the city desk a few weeks later, I saw the picture of the flag-raising on Iwo Jima -- page one, front and center. No missing it. News stories documented the bloody struggle. So bloody the US Marine deaths on Iwo Jima were one-third of all Marine deaths in World War II.\n\nOne day I was told to go the library -- the morgue of an earlier time -- to get the clips on Ernie Pyle, the beloved correspondent fatally shot in the early days of the Battle of Okinawa, \"the bloodiest battle of the Pacific War.\"\n\nThe war was always there.\n\nPerhaps I remember so much because I'm part of \"the greatest generation,\" on the young side, granted, military service aside. Those who did serve are passing at a rate that has been the subject of a number of stories. Whether someone served on the front lines or kept the home fires burning, each passing reduces the number to remember, to talk about these things, write about them.  \n\nWithout that, the events, like the memories, fade with the years, as surely as the wallpaper that gets full afternoon sun.  \n\nThe song \"Let's remember Pearl Harbor\" was played so often I could -- fudging just a few of the lyrics -- sing it for you today.\n\nI only had to Google precise dates and the number and type of planes in the Doolittle Raid for this story.\n\nI'm not a military historian. I don't bury myself in libraries, doing research on battles -- air, land, or sea. But I've been interested in what goes on in the world since I can remember, enhanced and polished by years in the newspaper business or its environs. And, perhaps, the impact -- on my world, our world -- of that long ago Sunday.\n\nDecember 7, 1941.\n\nThe date which will live in infamy.\n\nThe Sunday morning Japanese bombs rained down on US battleships and cruisers and destroyers. Torpedoes sped toward them. Machine-gun fire raked the decks.\n\nThe USS Arizona may be a beautiful memorial today. But 1,102 of the 1,177 sailors and Marines killed on the USS Arizona that Sunday are entombed below its decks. And, each day, up to nine quarts of oil rise to the surface from the submerged wreckage. It is sometimes referred to as the \"tears of the Arizona,\" or \"black tears.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.3250207901001, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1128, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 13, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.59967659661, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.3687943262411295, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/us/south-carolina-murders-todd-kohlehpp/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 530, "scraper_regex": 417}}, "headline": "3rd body found on alleged killer's South Carolina farm", "wordcount_as_scraped": 417, "date": "20161107080000", "story_content": "Authorities have found a third body on the property of Todd Kohlhepp, the South Carolina real estate agent accused of murder and kidnapping. \n\nThe body, found Monday, was close to another body recovered the day before, Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger told reporters.

How did that happen? \n\n\"Where do you want me to start exactly?\" he said, laughing somewhat nervously, as he sat recently for the first extensive, tell-all interview with CNN in a federal prison. \n\nToday, Mo, just 24, is at the start of an eight-year prison sentence for trying to join and help ISIS. But he is hardly a radical Muslim extremist. Remarkably, he said he got into this whole mess because he fell in love.\n\nFalling into trouble\n\nBorn and raised in Mississippi, Mo is the youngest of four brothers and has both Muslim and non-Muslim friends. He dated very little and had few girlfriends until his senior year at Mississippi State. There, he met and fell for Jaelyn Young, a sophomore studying chemistry who in high school was an honors student and cheerleader.\n\n\"In the beginning of my senior year I met this lady,\" Mo said, recalling his strong feelings for her. \n\n\"She was beautiful and things like that,\" he said, \"but also another thing that I find attractive in a woman is one who's, you know, bright, intelligent, open-minded. And that's how I got to know her a bit. We started hanging out. She not only was interested in me, but she had told me prior to us being together that she was interested in Islam.\"\n\nIslam is the religion in which Mo grew up. His father, Oda, is an imam, who originally hailed from Bethlehem in the West Bank before settling decades ago in Mississippi. Mo's father, along with his mother, Lisa, a New Jersey-born woman who converted to Islam, helped found and build the Islamic Center of Mississippi in Starkville. \n\nNot long after they became a couple, Jaelyn converted to Islam, and it was a complete surprise to Mo.\n\n\"At one point, you know, she told me that she's very serious about Islam, and she wanted to become a Muslim,\" he said. \"Then on that day when she did, actually it was a big surprise for me. My parents actually found out first that she became a Muslim. I was actually at the mosque at that time, saying my prayers. And I came back to find out that she had become Muslim, and I had no idea.\"\n\nThen came another surprise, he said. \n\n\"A few weeks later, and I never said anything to her about this, or, like, tried to, you know, force her ... she decided to wear the full hijab or niqab by herself. Like, it was on her own -- her own choice. You know, she was wearing it from her head and full robe that you typically see of Muslim women.\" \n\nThe niqab she wore covered every part of her in a black shroud, leaving only slits for her eyes visible, according to Mo's family. \n\nJaelyn was changing fast, he said, becoming stricter and more conservative in all parts of her life. \n\n\"As far as, like, the rapid stages that she was going through, I may have, should have been, like, scratching my head a little bit. I should have had ... a skeptical, like, analysis of, like, 'OK, maybe we've gone a little too fast,' \" he said laughing. \n\nBut, he said, he was deeply in love. \n\n\"And, you know, that love can ultimately ... blind out your intelligence, your reasoning. I believe that. I mean, without that love there, I don't believe I would be here today, with my charge and talking to you today. ... I wouldn't have even considered it at all.\" \n\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons rarely grants access to convicted felons such as Mo. CNN's interview was an exception, an agreement between the Department of Justice, CNN and Mo. His words shed light on just how powerful ISIS' online propaganda can be for American youths. Jaelyn, who was also convicted in the case, has refused to speak to CNN.\n\nPursuing her conversion and new religion, Jaelyn went to the Internet. And there, she found ISIS.\n\nJaelyn merely showed Mo the videos -- the clips did the rest.\n\n\"It started out with when ... she first became Muslim, you know, she wanted to learn more. ... I'm not sure how she came across some of the videos that she did at first, but I remember, like, some of them. Like, one of the first ones I remember seeing, a video that how ISIS came to be. And it was basically mentioning ... historical struggles in the Middle East. And then somehow it ties that back into, you know, everything is, like, the Western society's fault. You would see a lot of non-Muslims using like, vulgar language, and a whole lot of slander on top of that.\"\n\nMo followed Jaelyn's lead. \"When she showed me that video, I think it's just kind of like -- brought a tenseness in her and ... really strong anger in her. And she expressed those things to me. And, you know, me being in love with her, I felt those same things I guess, just because she was feeling it.\"\n\nMo said the goal was never to take part in jihad or commit violence -- but rather to help out as fellow Muslims in the newly forming Muslim state. \n\n\"When she first looked at these videos, she had  ... a strong belief that, 'OK, this is the group to really help out, you know, the Muslims.' \"\n\n\"What really, like, stuck out for me were well, what I thought from the videos were people helping rebuild towns -- people helping the needy --  what we consider humanitarian.\" \n\nCrazy as it sounds, the young lover said he did what his partner did. \n\n\"Throughout the time she convinced me of that ... I don't know exactly how, you know, it came to be, but I know that she knew I loved her at that time, and I was just going to follow whatever she said, and I felt like she knew that, like, I was going to follow anything that she said.\"\n\nThey began communicating through the Internet with people they thought were in ISIS, in Syria. In one note, Mo wrote: \"I'm good with computers, I'm good with I.T., I can help here.\"\n\n'I won't be coming back'\n\nAccording to the FBI, Jaelyn reached out to a contact she thought would help her and Mo travel to Turkey, cross the border into Syria and join ISIS. The two secretly married, began an intensive preparation period and bought one-way plane tickets to Istanbul.\n\nAnd on August 8, 2015, Mo and Jaelyn packed their bags. He wrote a touching goodbye letter to his parents. The first lines read: \"I'm sorry. I love you. I've decided to leave and I won't be coming back.\" A small heart is scrawled at the bottom of the page. Then the couple went to the airport near Columbus, Mississippi. They got as far as the boarding gate, and then they were arrested. \n\nAt that moment, Mo said, everything changed. \"Oh, my heart sank,\" he said. \"I felt like my whole body shut down. Just because, I was thinking to myself, 'It's, like, what now, what the heck are we doing?' \"\n\nThe FBI said both Jaelyn and Mo confessed at that moment. But they didn't have to. It turns out the online ISIS recruiter who had been helping make arrangements for the couple was in fact an FBI employee.\n\nThis past spring they both pleaded guilty, and they were sentenced in August. Mo was given a lighter sentence, citing his cooperation with authorities. Jaelyn, considered by authorities to be the mastermind, was sentenced to 12 years. \n\nThroughout the interview, Mo never once mentioned Jaelyn's name. \n\nHe also finds it difficult to speak about the other woman in his life -- his mother. She was suffering from cancer when he was arrested, and she died earlier this year.\n\n\"It is one of the biggest regrets that I have in my life -- still haunts me to this day,\" he said. \"That I would prefer this woman that I've only been together with for under a year, and lie to my mother about where I was going. And my mother's always been supportive throughout my life, you know, I never felt like, you know, I needed to do anything behind her back. I could always be full-front honest to her. But all it took was getting caught up for love of a lady, and that I threw -- throw your life away.\"        \n\nHe also regrets that during this time of confusion, especially about religion, he failed to reach out to his dad, an imam who would have never taught his son to kill or hurt anyone.\n\n\"I wish I'd reached out to the Muslim community. I wish I'd just reached out to my dad, because my dad's very knowledgeable in this stuff. Not only in Islam, but the Middle Eastern politics. You know, if I had just asked him, he would just illuminate me on what was really happening with this group.\"\n\nAsked about homegrown terrorists, or those in ISIS who have viciously killed innocents across Europe and in Syria, Mo said he would never wish to be part of anything like that. \n\n\"They have a lack of understanding of Islam, because the main focus of Islam is peace, you know. Submit your will to God,\" he said. \"ISIS, you know, kind of twists that to say that, you know, 'If we're doing things for the will of God, you know, you gotta come and join us as, you know, because we're the real Muslim community.' \" \n\n\"I feel like that I should owe people back to say, 'Hey, don't do what I did.' That's not what they are doing over there. What ISIS is doing over there -- that's not Islam. ... If you ever feel like you're thinking about doing this, contact the Muslim community. They're going tell you, 'No, this is a whole terrible idea.'\"\n\nToday, Mo is not bitter; in fact, he said he is relieved he was caught. He knows that had he made it to Syria there is a good chance he would be dead. He remains a devout Muslim. He will be 32 when he leaves prison.

The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible.  The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump.\n\nThe classified briefings last week were presented by four of the senior-most US intelligence chiefs -- Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers.\n\nOne reason the nation's intelligence chiefs took the extraordinary step of including the synopsis in the briefing documents was to make the President-elect aware that such allegations involving him are circulating among intelligence agencies, senior members of Congress and other government officials in Washington, multiple sources tell CNN.\n\nThese senior intelligence officials also included the synopsis to demonstrate that Russia had compiled information potentially harmful to both political parties, but only released information damaging to Hillary Clinton and Democrats.  This synopsis was not an official part of the report from the intelligence community case about Russian hacks, but some officials said it augmented the evidence that Moscow intended to harm Clinton's candidacy and help Trump's, several officials with knowledge of the briefings tell CNN.\n\nThe two-page synopsis also included allegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government, according to two national security officials. \n\nSources tell CNN that these same allegations about communications between the Trump campaign and the Russians, mentioned in classified briefings for congressional leaders last year, prompted then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid to send a letter to FBI Director Comey in October, in which he wrote, \"It has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government -- a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States.\" \n\nCNN has confirmed that the synopsis was included in the documents that were presented to Mr. Trump but cannot confirm if it was discussed in his meeting with the intelligence chiefs. \n\nThe Trump transition team declined repeated requests for comment. \n\nAppearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, dismissed the memos, as unverified and untrue. \n\nCNN has reviewed a 35-page compilation of the memos, from which the two-page synopsis was drawn. The memos have since been published by Buzzfeed. The memos originated as opposition research, first commissioned by anti-Trump Republicans, and later by Democrats.  At this point, CNN is not reporting on details of the memos, as it has not independently corroborated the specific allegations. But, in preparing this story, CNN has spoken to multiple high ranking intelligence, administration, congressional and law enforcement officials, as well as foreign officials and others in the private sector with direct knowledge of the memos.\n\nRussia denies having \"Kompromat\" on Donald Tump\n\nSome of the memos were circulating as far back as last summer.  What has changed since then is that US intelligence agencies have now checked out the former British intelligence operative and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough to include some of the information in the presentations to the President and President-elect a few days ago.\n\nOn the same day that the President-elect was briefed by the intelligence community, the top four Congressional leaders, and chairmen and ranking members of the  House and Senate intelligence committees -- the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" --  were also provided a summary of the memos regarding Mr. Trump, according to law enforcement, intelligence and administration sources. \n\nThe two-page summary was written without the detailed specifics and information about sources and methods included in the memos by the former British intelligence official. That said, the synopsis was considered so sensitive it was not included in the classified report about Russian hacking that was more widely distributed, but rather in an annex only shared at the most senior levels of the government:  President Obama, the President-elect, and the eight Congressional leaders.\n\nCNN has also learned that on December 9, Senator John McCain gave a full copy of the memos -- dated from June through December, 2016 -- to FBI Director James Comey.  McCain became aware of the memos from a former British diplomat who had been posted in Moscow.  But the FBI had already been given a set of the memos compiled up to August 2016, when the former MI6 agent presented them to an FBI official in Rome, according to national security officials. \n\nThe raw memos on which the synopsis is based were prepared by the former MI6 agent, who was posted in Russia in the 1990s and now runs a private intelligence gathering firm.  His investigations related to Mr. Trump were initially funded by groups and donors supporting Republican opponents of Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries, multiple sources confirmed to CNN.  Those sources also said that once Mr. Trump became the nominee, further investigation was funded by groups and donors supporting Hillary Clinton.  \n\nSpokespeople for the FBI and the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. Officials who spoke to CNN declined to do so on the record given the classified nature of the material.  \n\nSome of the allegations were first reported publicly in Mother Jones one week before the election.\n\nOne high level administration official told CNN, \"I have a sense the outgoing administration and intelligence community is setting down the pieces so this must be investigated seriously and run down. I think [the] concern was to be sure that whatever information was out there is put into the system so it is evaluated as it should be and acted upon as necessary.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.39254170656204207, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 942, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.52324043183, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.7600849256900197, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/26/health/meals-on-wheels-health-safety-checks/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 924, "scraper_regex": 992}}, "headline": "Meals On Wheels wants to play a bigger role in health care", "wordcount_as_scraped": 992, "date": "20161226130000", "story_content": "Debbie Case held an insulated bag with two packaged meals \u2014 a sandwich wrap and fruit for lunch, a burrito and cauliflower for dinner.\n\n\"You're going to eat well today,\" Case told 75-year-old Dave Kelly as she handed him the meals. Kelly lost his sight about two years ago and reluctantly gave up cooking.\n\nAfter putting the food away, Kelly chatted with Case about his experience as a folk musician. As they talked in his living room, Case, CEO of San Diego County's Meals on Wheels program, glanced around for hazards that could cause Kelly to fall.\n\nKelly said the homemade meals keep him from eating too much frozen food or take-out. But more than that, he said he appreciates someone coming by to check on him every day.\n\n\"Anything could happen,\" Kelly said, adding that he worries about falling. \"I wouldn't want to lay around and suffer for days.\"\n\nMeals on Wheels is undergoing a dramatic overhaul as government and philanthropic funding fails to keep pace with a rapidly growing elderly population. The increased demand has resulted in lengthy waitlists and a need to find other sources of funding. And at the same time, for-profit companies such as Mom's Meals are creating more competition.\n\nMeals on Wheels, which has served seniors for more than 60 years through a network of independent nonprofits, is trying to formalize the health and safety checks its volunteers already conduct during their daily home visits to seniors. Through an ongoing campaign dubbed \"More Than a Meal,\" the organization hopes to demonstrate that it can play a critical role in the health care system.\n\n\"We know we are keeping people out of the hospital,\" Case said. \"Seven dollars a day is cheaper than $1,300 a day.\"\n\nMeals on Wheels America and several of the local programs around the country have launched partnerships with insurers, hospitals and health systems. By reporting to providers any physical or mental changes they observe, volunteers can help improve seniors' health and reduce unnecessary emergency room visits and nursing home placements, said Ellie Hollander, CEO of Meals on Wheels America.\n\n\"It's a small investment for a big payoff,\" Hollander said.\n\nStudies conducted by Brown University researchers have shown that meal deliveries can help elderly people stay out of nursing homes, reduce falls and save states money.\n\nKali Thomas, an assistant professor at Brown University School of Public Health, estimated that if all states increased the number of older people receiving the meals by 1%, they would save more than $100 million. Research also has shown that the daily meal deliveries helped seniors' mental health and eased their fears of being institutionalized.\n\nMeals on Wheels can be the \"eyes and ears\" for health providers, especially in the case of seniors who are ill and don't have family nearby, said Thomas, who authored several studies of the organization.\n\nMeals on Wheels has \"the potential to capitalize on that,\" she said. \"They realize they are doing something that is unique and needed in our current health care space.\"\n\nVisitors from Meals on Wheels are the only people some seniors see all day. The volunteers get to know them and can quickly recognize problems.\n\n\"You notice if they are losing weight, if their house is a mess, if they are talking awkwardly,\" said Chris Baca, executive director of Meals on Wheels West in Santa Monica. \"Our wellness check is critical and almost as important as the food itself.\"\n\nThe meal delivery and in-home visits also reduce isolation among residents, said Zia Agha, chief medical officer for West Health, which has organizations that provide and study senior servwices. Agha said that while numerous high-tech gadgets are available to keep an eye on seniors, they can't replace a volunteer's human touch.\n\nMeals on Wheels, Brown University and the West Health Institute recently launched a two-year project in six states to formally build health and safety screenings into daily meal deliveries. The goal is to improve seniors' health and catch problems early.\n\n\"The fact that you don't have resources to feed yourself or you are so frail you can't cook is a very big marker that you are going to have high health care utilization,\" Agha said. \"There is value in targeting these clients through this meal delivery service.\"\n\nThat's also what Meals on Wheels America is planning to do in a new partnership with Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and Meals on Wheels of Central Maryland. The project aims to keep seniors at home and reduce their need for costly health services after hospitalization. The idea is to have trained volunteers report red flags and ensure, for example, that patients with congestive heart failure are weighing themselves regularly and eating properly.\n\nDan Hale, who is leading the project from the hospital, said the meal delivery volunteers can help track patients' health even months after discharge and keep them from returning to the hospital. \"It makes sense financially,\" he said.\n\nFunding for Meals on Wheels organizations primarily comes from the federal government, state organizations and donors.\n\nThe partnerships with health care organizations and insurers mean additional money for the Los Angeles County programs, said Baca, who heads a countywide association of local Meals on Wheels organizations.\n\nOn a recent day in Santa Monica, volunteers showed up just after 10 a.m., loaded up their cars with meals and headed out to deliver them. One of the clients, 58-year old Patrick Ward, receives daily meals at his apartment in Venice.\n\nWard, who has osteoarthritis and knee problems, said he has fallen numerous times and also had a heart attack this year. He said he can take care of himself pretty well, but his lack of mobility makes cooking difficult.\n\n\"It takes one thing out of the day that I don't have to worry about,\" Ward said. \"I know they are going to be here every day.\"\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.588812589645386, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 924, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.08100420768, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 13, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161226130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4069264069264098, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.1818181818200002}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/opinions/letter-to-president-trump-perez-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Dear Mr. President: We're going to fight back ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 762, "date": "20170120190000", "story_content": "President Donald J. Trump,\n\nAs of 12:01 PM ET today, you are the President of the United States. For the next four years, you will assume the responsibilities of our nation's highest office. But while you won the Electoral College contest in November, you have yet to win the respect of most Americans.\n\n \n\nAs a civil rights attorney and the proud son of two immigrants from the Dominican Republic, I was appalled by your campaign. You appealed to our nation's oldest fears and divisions, and you disguised all of this prejudice as patriotism. But now that you have taken an oath to serve the American people, I want to offer some words of wisdom -- and of warning.\n\nFrom the moment you launched your campaign nineteen months ago, you sought to divide and demonize people of every background. You called Mexicans criminals and rapists; you demeaned women and disparaged war heroes; you vowed to ban Muslims and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants; you even attacked a Gold Star family and a disabled reporter.  And let us not forget the years you spent working to delegitimize President Barack Obama, our country's first black president, with racist lies about his birthplace. \n\nAnd your words had consequences. From schools to churches, your rhetoric fueled bigotry across the country and emboldened all those who wish to divide us by what we look like, where we come from, who we love, or how we pray. \n\nWhen you weren't attacking everyday Americans, you were making empty promises. You preached a gospel of jobs, jobs, jobs. But you've already shown your campaign to be nothing more than a long con.\n\nJust look at your dangerously unqualified cabinet appointments. You claim you want to raise wages, but you've nominated a labor secretary that is the plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking to stop millions of American workers from earning overtime pay. For attorney general, you've chosen a man who once said that immigrants from the Dominican Republic, my parents' homeland, don't have \"a provable skill that would benefit [our country] or that would indicate their likely success in our society.\" You have failed to appoint a single Latino cabinet member and have done away with the important tradition of appointing members of the opposite party. And instead of \"draining the swamp\" as you promised, you've moved Wall Street back into the White House.\n\nPresident Obama carried himself with dignity and grace. He understood that democracy is bigger than any one person or party. And that principle guided every decision he made as president -- no matter what was popular or politically expedient.\n\nThat's how he led us out of the worst recession of our lifetime, brought unemployment down to 4.7%, and put millions of Americans back to work.  Those are facts, not fake news.\n\nThat's why he expanded health care for more than 20 million Americans and brought the uninsured rate below 10% for first time in our history. Those are facts, not fake news.\n\nPresident Obama earned the American people's trust by fighting for them and being honest with them, and you must do the same.\n\nDo not mistake our country for another business you can bankrupt -- financially or morally. Do not mistake our people for another contractor you can cheat. Do not mistake our democracy for another one of your reality shows. Your name may be written into history as America's 45th president, but we, the people, will decide how your story is told.\n\nWe won't go tweet-for-tweet or insult-for-insult with you. We've got two better weapons in our arsenal: clipboards and people. And we're going to build the strongest grassroots organizing force this country has ever seen.\n\nWhen you try to go after immigrants living in the shadows, we will fight back. \n\nWhen you try to side with big corporations over American workers, we will fight back.\n\nWhen you try to crush middle class families while lifting up the wealthiest Americans, we will fight back.\n\nWhen you try to take away people's health care or a woman's right to choose, we will fight back. \n\nWhen you try to damage our environment and ignore the consequences of climate change, we will fight back. \n\n And when you try to undermine our democracy through division and despair, we will fight back. \n\nFor the next four years, we will not be intimidated by a bully in president's clothing. We will fight every single attempt you make to stop or roll back progress, and we will continue to promote opportunity and equality in everything we do.\n\nAnd unlike you, Mr. President, we keep our promises.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.52369379997253, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 729, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "HarmVice": 13, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.7768323777900004, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 43, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170120190000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 5.898491083676269, "mft_mean": 3.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/11/europe/turkey-violence/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 941, "scraper_regex": 1290}}, "headline": "Timeline: Turkey's bloody year ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1290, "date": "20161211090000", "story_content": "In one of the most terror-scarred countries in the world, not even New Year's Day was safe from an attack.\n\nJust an hour after the new year began, a gunman shot his way into a popular high-end nightclub in Istanbul, killing at least 35 people. Scores more were wounded. \n\nThe attack was the latest in a wave of deadly violence that has killed people in different parts of Turkey throughout the past 365 days.\n\n2016 was a violent year for Turkey. There were suicide blasts claimed by ISIS and running battles between government forces and outlawed Kurdish PKK militants. A failed coup sparked a wide-ranging crackdown on alleged coup plotters.

It also injured over 100 people.\n\nISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in Diyarbakir, according to a statement circulated online by the ISIS-affiliated Amaq agency.\n\nOctober 9: 'Suicide rush' near Iraqi border\n\nA bomb exploded outside a police station in the Semdinli district of Hakkari Province -- about  48 miles from the Iraqi border -- killing at least 18 people. \n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said eight civilians died and 10 soldiers were killed in the attack, in which a pickup truck laden with about five tons of explosives made a \"suicide rush\" at a checkpoint outside the station. The PKK claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe US condemned the bombing \"in the strongest terms\".\n\nSeptember 12: Car bomb near government offices\n\nSuspected Kurdish militants detonated a car bomb near local government offices in the southeastern city of Van, wounding at least 50 people. \n\nThe blast hit some 200 meters from the Van provincial governor's office. It occurred a day after two dozen mayors from Kurdish-run municipalities were stripped of their office.\n\nAugust 21: The bloody wedding\n\nA suspected suicide bomber detonated explosives at a wedding party in the southeastern city of Gaziantep, killing at least 53 people and injuring about 100. The Turkish president blamed ISIS for the attack.\n\nAugust 18: Three bombings in the east\n\nThree bomb attacks targeting Turkish security forces in the east of the country killed 12 people and wounded nearly 300 others.\n\nBlasts at police stations in Van and Elazig killed four police officers and two civilians, reports said.\n\nIn Bitlis province, five soldiers died when their vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb in the village of Gayda. In nearby Nazar, a village guard was killed and a soldier wounded in clashes between security forces and PKK militants.\n\nTurkish officials blame the PKK for all three attacks.\n\nJuly 15: The failed coup\n\nAn attempted military coup in Turkey left at least 290 people dead and over 1,400 injured in a chaotic night of violence. Since then, tens of thousands of people have been arrested in the crackdown on individuals suspected of having ties to alleged coup plotters.\n\nRelated: What you need to know about the failed coup\n\nJune 28: Ataturk Airport attack\n\nThree assailants killed at least 36 people and injured scores of others in a gun and suicide bombing attack at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. An additional 147 people were wounded.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Turkish officials blamed ISIS for the attack.\n\nJune 8: Car bomb in Midyat\n\nThree people were killed by a car bomb in the southeastern Turkish town of Midyat -- the second such attack on Turkish police targets in two days.\n\nJune 7: 11 killed in Istanbul\n\nA car bomb attack targeting a police bus killed 11 people in Istanbul, Anadolu reported, citing police officials.\n\nThe blast, in the Beyazit neighborhood of Istanbul's historic Fatih district, occurred during morning rush hour. It killed seven police officers and four civilians and left 36 people injured, three of them critically, authorities said. Four people were detained.\n\nMarch 31:  7 police officers slain\n\nSeven police officers died and at least 27 more people were wounded by a car bombing close to a bus terminal in southeastern Turkey.\n\nThe bomb went off as a police vehicle was going past the Baglar district of Diyarbakir, the capital of its namesake province, about 170 kilometers (100 miles) from the Syrian border, Anadolu reported. \n\nThe injured include 14 civilians and 13 police. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack. \n\nMarch 19: Istanbul blast kills 4 foreigners\n\nA suicide bomber detonated explosives in a busy tourist area of central Istanbul, killing at least four people and wounding 36 others.\n\nTwo of the four dead were American-Israeli dual citizens, an Israeli government source and a US source said. A third Israeli also died, along with an Iranian.\n\nInterior Minister Efkan Ala identified that attacker as Mehmet Ozturk and claimed he had links to ISIS.\n\nMarch 13: Kurdish rebels claim Ankara blast\n\nThirty-seven people died in when a car bomb ripped through a busy square in Turkey's capital, Ankara.\n\nThe Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, or TAK -- a militant offshoot of the Kurdish separatist group PKK, which seeks an independent state in Turkey -- boasted that its members carried out this attack.\n\nA ceasefire between Turkey and the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, fell apart last summer. Since then, Turkish forces have bombed the terror group's positions in northern Iraq and imposed curfews in crackdowns on heavily Kurdish areas in southeastern Turkey.  \n\nFebruary 17: Explosion hits military vehicles \n\nAn explosion apparently targeting military vehicles in Ankara left 29 dead and 61 wounded, according to Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus. All but one of the fatalities were members of the security forces.\n\nThree military vehicles and one private vehicle were stopped at a traffic light when the bomb went off, sending large flames shooting into the night sky.\n\nLater that week, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons called that attack a \"suicide revenge mission\" for Turkish military operations in the southeastern Turkish district of Cizre and threatened more violence.\n\nJanuary 12: Strike near tourist attractions\n\nA suicide blast in Istanbul's Sultanahmet Square killed 13 people, eight of them Germans, in what was viewed as a strike against both Turkish culture and the country's multibillion-dollar tourism industry.\n\nThe explosion ripped through a typically busy area between the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque, both major tourist attractions in Istanbul.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu blamed ISIS, which has entrenched itself in neighboring Syria and Iraq while lashing out elsewhere again and again.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -11.7529878616333, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 941, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 41, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 11.6484312426, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 41, "mft_sum": 48, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161211090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.1009564293305, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.36363636364}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/22/politics/donald-trump-strengthen-expand-nuclear-capability/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1091, "scraper_regex": 1206}}, "headline": "Trump, Putin both seek to boost their nuclear capability", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1206, "date": "20161222230000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump signaled Thursday that he will look to \"strengthen and expand\" the US's nuclear capability hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to enhance his country's nuclear forces.\n\nThe exchange appeared to raise the prospect of a new arms race between the two nuclear superpowers, which between them boast more than 14,000 nuclear warheads, the still deadly legacy of their four-decades long Cold War standoff.\n\nBut the comments by Putin, who is presiding over a project to restore Russia's lost global power and influence, and Trump, who will shortly become the US commander-in-chief, did not spell out exactly what each side is proposing or whether a major change of nuclear doctrine is in the offing.\n\nTrump weighed in with a tweet just hours after Putin spoke following a meeting with his military advisers to review the activity of the past year.\n\n\"The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,\" Trump wrote.\n\nOn Friday, Putin downplayed the risk of a new nuclear arms race between Russia and the US and said there was \"nothing new\" in Trump's tweet.\n\n\"During his election campaign, (Trump) said US needs to bolster nuclear capabilities and armed forces in general and there is nothing new,\" Putin said at this annual news conference.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the President-elect is proposing an entire new nuclear policy that he would begin to flesh out once he takes office next year.\n\nTrump could also be referring to plans to modernize the current US nuclear arsenal that are currently underway and will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The Obama administration has outlined a plan to modernize delivery systems, command and control systems and to refurbish warheads in the US nuclear triad -- the US force of sea, airborne and missile delivered nuclear weapons.\n\nBut the plan keeps the size of the nuclear force at existing levels.\n\nTrump's tweet appeared to envisage an expansion of the size of the US nuclear force, but it was not immediately clear if that is the case.\n\nTrump communications director Jason Miller sent a statement to try to explain the President-elect's tweet on nuclear capability.\n\nHe suggested Trump was \"referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it,\" although that was not referenced in the tweet. He also said Trump was emphasizing the need to \"modernize our deterrent capability.\"\n\nIn Moscow earlier Tuesday, Putin said in a defense speech that Russia needs to \"enhance the combat capability of strategic nuclear forces, primarily by strengthening missile complexes that will be guaranteed to penetrate existing and future missile defense systems.\"\n\nPutin's remarks appeared to suggest that he was talking about new weapons systems that could overcome US missile defenses, a development that could force the US to respond. It was not clear, however, if he was contemplating an expansion in the total numbers of Russian weapons or of the stocks of those arms that are deployed. \n\nRELATED: 3 things to know about that nuclear triad\n\nTrump and Putin have suggested Trump's inauguration next month will ring in closer relations after the two sides retreated to their most entrenched positions since the end of the Cold War.\n\nThe ambiguity and timing of Putin's remarks also suggested that he may be laying an opening gambit in his relationship with the new US President-elect.\n\nThe Russian President is seeking to return Russia to the front ranks of global influence, a project that is key to his domestic political survival and often involves actively seeking to undermine US power.\n\nHis power plays in Ukraine and in Syria and military maneuvers close to the borders of former Warsaw Pact states have alarmed Western leaders and stoked tensions in Europe.\n\nAnd while Russia's economic and conventional military strength pales beside that of the US, its nuclear arsenal remains the root of its power and prestige.\n\nIt is also unlikely to be a coincidence that Putin's remarks came three days before the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Soviet Union, a collapse he views as a disaster of history.\n\nTrump, who sees foreign policy through the eyes of an ultimate deal maker, may have felt the need to respond to Putin's remarks. He did so a day after meeting with his incoming military officials at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. CNN's Barbara Starr reported that the talks included discussion of plans to modernize the US nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe President-elect's choice of Twitter to make such an important and sensitive statement was characteristic of his operating style. \n\nBut it underlined how the shorthanded communication of policy by social media is imprecise and open to multiple interpretations that are already posing problems for foreign governments as they seek to divine Trump's true intentions.\n\nStill, the suggestion that he could preside over a new nuclear arms race will spook critics who argued he showed himself unfamiliar with basic nuclear doctrine during the campaign.\n\nDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton had argued that it would be a mistake to hand the US nuclear codes over to a man who could be \"baited with a tweet.\"\n\nThe President-elect also caused consternation in Asia by suggesting that Japan and South Korea who are protected under the US nuclear umbrella might think about developing their own weapons, a move that could unleash a new global nuclear arms race.\n\nTrump's comment on Twitter also strikes a sharp contrast with the early months of the administration of President Barack Obama, who committed himself to the symbolic goal of a world without nuclear weapons -- an act that helped him win the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nObama also concluded a new Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (START) with Putin's predecessor as Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev. The treaty imposed new limits on the numbers of launchers and warheads each side have deployed.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump argued that the US needs to modernize its aging nuclear infrastructure.\n\n\"Our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen,\" Trump said during his second debate in October against Clinton. \"We are old. We're tired. We're exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.\"\n\nAmerica's nuclear submarines are all more than 30 years old and its most dominant long-range bomber remains the 60-year-old B-52s. The Pentagon has also called for upgrading the US arsenal of ICBMs, or intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nThe Pentagon has estimated that it will need to spend as much as $18 billion per year over the next 15 years -- for a total of $270 billion -- to modernize the nuclear triad.\n\nThe United States has 7,100 nuclear warheads while Russia has 7,300, according to the non-partisan Arms Control Association. \n\nThe US has 1,367 warheads deployed on inter-continental ballistic missiles, heavy bombers and on submarines, the State Department said in September. Russia has 1,796 in the same category.\n\nRussia's inventory of deployed warheads has risen in number owing to fluctuations in Moscow's modernization program and is not seen as a strategic worry by the US military. The United States currently has fewer total weapons, including those in reserve, than Russia because it has dismantled more obsolete devices.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.50250422954559, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1091, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.43739893644, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4665444546287798, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/20/europe/turkey-russia-ambassador-syria/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 808, "scraper_regex": 1022}}, "headline": "Russia 'determined to fight terror' after envoy's assassination", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1022, "date": "20161220090000", "story_content": "Russia warned it will not make \"concessions to terrorists\" a day after its ambassador was gunned down in the Turkish capital, Ankara.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said his country remained \"determined to fight terrorism\" after a meeting Tuesday in Moscow with his Turkish and Iranian counterparts.\n\nThe man who opened fire on the ambassador was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a Turkish police officer. \n\nTuesday's meeting had been arranged to discuss the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo before Russian ambassador Andrey Karlov was gunned down Monday at the opening of an art exhibition in Ankara. It comes as an 18-strong investigative team of Russia's special agencies arrived in Turkey to help authorities with their inquiries.\n\nEnvoy's body returned to Moscow\n\nKarlov's body arrived in Moscow late Tuesday. The ambassador was bestowed honors upon arrival in a ceremony attended by Lavrov, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and the widow of the deceased, according to Russia's Foreign Ministry.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Lavrov said the tragedy made the talks even more urgent, according to Russian state-run news agency Sputnik.\n\n\"This tragedy makes all of us more determined to fight terrorism,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying. \n\nHe hoped the talks would \"create conditions for a more efficient delivery of humanitarian aid without making any concessions to terrorists,\" he said.\n\n\"It is necessary to establish all the circumstances of the organization and (the) execution of the terrorist act as soon as possible.\"\n\nCavusoglu said the attack was intended to \"harm our relations and destroy all the achievements we have made together recently.\"\n\nHe welcomed the investigative team from Russia, saying the two countries would work together to \"uncover who is behind this vile and treacherous terror attack.\"\n\nOpinion: An acrid whiff of 1914?\n\n\"Turkey and Russia have recently proven what they can achieve when they cooperate, not only to their own people but to the whole world,\" he said.\n\n\"We will maintain this cooperation in Syria in order to reach a political resolution and also extend the cooperation to other areas.\"\n\nHe announced the street that houses the Russian Embassy in Ankara will be renamed in Karlov's honor. \n\nShooter's relatives taken in for questioning\n\nOn Monday night, Altintas, the police officer, fired several shots at Karlov, shouting, \"Allahu akbar (God is greatest). Do not forget Aleppo! Do not forget Syria! Do not forget Aleppo! Do not forget Syria!\" \n\nVideo and photographs taken during the exhibition show that shortly before the shooting, Altintas had been standing behind Karlov while the envoy was making remarks. Turkish security forces eventually killed Altintas, Turkey's Interior Ministry said.\n\nSeven people were taken in for questioning in relation to the shooting, including the shooter's parents, sister, uncle and two other relatives. A roommate, a police officer, was also arrested, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu.\n\nAltintas' uncle was released under \"judicial control,\" or bail-like conditions, Anadolu quoted security sources as saying. \n\nAccording to Anadolu, the uncle was a former senior executive at a private school connected to cleric Fethullah Gulen, whose movement Turkey considers a terrorist group. The school was shut down after a failed coup in July. \n\nAnadolu also reported that books about al Qaeda and Gulen's movement, which the Turkish government calls the Fethullah Gulen Terrorist Organization, were found after a search of Altintas' home. \n\nTurkey alleges that members of Gulen's movement were behind the coup attempt.\n\nThe failed coup triggered a wave of arrests, detentions and dismissals of those suspected of any involvement.\n\nFailed Turkey coup looked 'like a Hollywood movie'\n\nThe rest of Altintas' relatives were taken in for questioning, the agency quoted security sources as saying. \n\nThe ambassador's assassination came at a time of thawing relations between Russia and Turkey and at a pivotal moment in Syria in which Russia has been instrumental in President Bashar al-Assad's push to retake rebel-held areas.\n\nWhat do we know about the assassin?\n\nPutin: Shooting a 'provocation'\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said the killing was a clear provocation aimed at undermining not just the normalization of Russian-Turkish relations but also the \"peace process in Syria\" promoted by Russia, Turkey, Iran and other countries.\n\n\"The only response we should offer to this murder is stepping up our fight against terror, and the criminals will feel the heat,\" Putin said in televised remarks.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan echoed Putin's sentiments, saying \"the Russian government and the Turkish republic have the will to not fall into that provocation.\"\n\nPutin will delay his annual news conference on Thursday in order to pay his respects to the slain ambassador, whose funeral will be held that day, Sputnik reported. \n\nRoles of Russia and Turkey in Syria\n\nHuman rights groups and other countries have denounced Russia over its backing of the Syrian leader. \n\nMoscow, the most powerful ally of the Assad regime, has carried out airstrikes since September 2015 to prop up the embattled ruler. As one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia has used its veto powers to block a political solution to end the war.\n\nThe bombardment in Syria has drawn criticism from Western powers, with President Barack Obama on Friday accusing Russia of slaughtering civilians in the besieged city of Aleppo in concert with the Assad regime. Moscow has recently tried to distance itself from the assault in eastern Aleppo.\n\nTurkey's involvement in Syria is complicated. On one hand, the Turks are eager to help eradicate ISIS. On the other, Ankara has worked to drive Kurdish fighters from the Syrian side of the border. \n\nMeanwhile, the United States supports Kurdish groups in both Syria and Iraq as critical partners in the battle against ISIS.\n\nEmbassies closed \n\nAll US embassy and consulates in Turkey were to be closed Tuesday after a separate incident, hours after the Russian envoy's assassination. \n\nTurkish police arrested a man who fired into the air with a shotgun outside the US Embassy in Ankara, Anadolu reported.\n\nVideo fed by Turkish video news agency IHA showed security officers leading a handcuffed man into an unmarked police car as he shouted in Turkish, \"I swear to God.

New trade agreements will be negotiated that provide for the interests of US workers and companies first.\"\n\nWhat would happen if the US left NAFTA?\n\nThe 200-day plan is built around five main principles, plus an extra plank on manufacturing jobs. First is renegotiating or withdrawing from NAFTA, second is stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, third is stopping \"unfair imports,\" fourth is ending \"unfair trade practices,\" and fifth is pursuing bilateral trade deals. The final focus, to \"retain and return manufacturing jobs,\" focuses on lowering the business tax rate and eliminating regulations on businesses and restrictions on domestic energy. \n\nThe provisions on TPP are almost certainly moot, as congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle say the deal will not come up for ratification in the lame duck congressional session. Trump would then not need to take any action to kill it, because the deal would be effectively dead. \n\nCongressional leaders say TPP is dead\n\nThe plan also gives benchmarks for Days 1, 100 and 200 of the Trump administration.\n\nDay 1: Begin NAFTA reform\n\nOn Day 1, Trump would begin reforming NAFTA, including ordering the Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to begin a study on what the ramifications of withdrawing from the treaty would be, and what would be required legislatively to do so. He would also have the US Trade Representative notify Mexico and Canada that the US intends to propose some amendments to the treaty, which could include measures on currency manipulation, lumber, country of origin labeling and environmental and safety standards.\n\nA draft presidential memorandum at the end of the document that could be used to order the review of NAFTA orders the report to pay \"extra consideration to the effects such a policy change may have on the middle class, manufacturing and service sector workers, and foreign direct investment into the United States.\"\n\nTrump would also submit legislation on currency manipulation, review whether our trading partners engage in \"harmful\" practices, and would order the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US to review food security in trade and reciprocity in international corporate takeovers (i.e. whether a US company would be able to buy a Chinese company like a Chinese company would be able to be buy a US company).\n\nDay 100: Target China\n\nBy Day 100, the plan says, Trump would continue NAFTA renegotiations, would pursue cracking down on China by seeing if they could be labeled a currency manipulator and through bilateral trade negotiations. He would also bring the intelligence community into the trade world. \n\nDay 200: Consider formal withdrawal\n\nBy Day 200, Trump would be considering formally withdrawing from NAFTA and continuing to pursue bilateral trade agreements. The document notes that Congress has granted the President Trade Promotion Authority -- power for the President to get trade deals through Congress more swiftly -- until 2018 and it could be extended until 2021. \n\nThe memo notes caveats, including that there could be negative consequences of withdrawing from NAFTA. But the document also notes those impacts could be mitigated if the US were to pursue bilateral trade agreements with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe Trump transition didn't respond to a request for comment about if Trump had reviewed the document and what his thoughts were.

Nimrud is 20 miles (30 km) southeast of Mosul. \n\nPhotos: Precious monuments lost in conflicts\n\nNimrud and Nineveh\n\nNimrud and nearby Nineveh are the sites where two Assyrian kings, Sennacherib (704-681 B.C.) and Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 B.C.), recorded successful military campaigns on the walls of their palaces, according to the World Monuments Fund, a group dedicated to saving the world's most treasured places.\n\n\"The palaces of Sennacherib at Nineveh and Ashurnasirpal II at Nimrud are vestiges of the political, cultural and artistic height of the Assyrian Empire,\" the WMF says on its website under the heading, \"Why it Matters.\" The group had helped preserve the treasures at Nimrud following the 2003 Iraq war.\n\nNimrud flourished between 900 B.C. and 612 B.C. Buildings there \"have yielded thousands of carved ivories, mostly made in the 9th and 8th centuries B.C., now one of the richest collections of ivory in the world,\" according to Encyclopedia Britannica's website. \n\nThe famous British mystery novelist Agatha Christie accompanied her husband, archaeologist Max Mallowan, at his excavation in Nimrud and helped clean some of the ivories.\n\nThis is not the first time that ISIS has targeted cultural and ancient sites in Iraq and Syria. The terror group took over the ancient ruined city of Hatra in 2014, using it to store weapons and ammunitions. It has destroyed libraries, palaces and churches, and blown up shrines such as the tomb of Jonah, a holy site said to be the burial place of the prophet Jonah, and a key figure in Christianity, Judaism and Islam.\n\nLast year ISIS militants using sledgehammers obliterated stone sculptures and other centuries-old artifacts in the Mosul Museum.\n\n\"ISIS continues to defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity,\"  Iraq's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a statement last year, condemning the destruction in the Mosul museum.\n\n\"Letting these lost gangs go without punishment will encourage them to destroy humanity's civilization, the Mesopotamian civilization, inflicting irreversible priceless damages and losses.\"\n\nOther precious monuments destroyed by war\n\nIraq's neighbor Syria is also a treasure trove of archaeological sites, many of which have been reduced to rubble during that country's ongoing civil war.\n\nISIS is part of a puritanical strain of Islam that considers all religious shrines -- Islamic, Christian, Jewish, etc. -- idolatrous. \n\nIt is not the only militant group bent on the destruction of the symbols of ancient life. In 2001, the Taliban blew up giant statues, the Buddhas of Bamiyan, in Afghanistan despite international pleas to spare the country's pre-Islamic relics.\n\nThe destruction has disturbed many scholars and historians.\n\n\"All attacks on archaeological sites and artifacts are brutal assaults on our collective human memory,\" Cornell University archaeologist and classicist Sturt W. Manning wrote in a commentary for CNN.

English pub investment index\n\n\"I dropped into The Plough at Cadsden for a pint of IPA and some fish and chips with China's President Xi,\" tweeted David Cameron in 2015. \n\nUK's former prime minister probably didn't expect that, in addition to the Chinese president, he had also brought along many Chinese tourists -- who are keen to sample the food and a pint of the Greene King IPA Xi enjoyed -- as well as a business deal to follow.\n\nThe 16th-century pub has recently been sold to a group of Chinese investors for an undisclosed fee.\n\nBefore Xi's visit, the Buckinghamshire tavern was already famous for being a UK prime ministers' local because of its proximity to Chequers Court, the country retreat of the head of Britain.\n\n2. \"Mich-Jinping\" food guide\n\nXi's taste buds have become so influential that Hong Kong's Apple Daily has compared the president to a walking Michelin guide for China.\n\nWant to try the pig-blood noodles Xi sampled 20 years ago? A noodle shop in Fuzhou, Fujian, where Xi ate noodles two decades ago has leveraged the president's popularity into long lines.\n\nXi confirmed his love of the dish in 2014, and perhaps made the shop's owners' dreams come true, when he re-visited the place and had another bowl.\n\nThe owner told a reporter that ever since the news broke out, there's been a significant increase in customers. \n\nItems that had previously been sold out at around 11 p.m. were gone by 5 p.m.\n\nIn 2014, according to Hong Kong-based newspaper Ta Kung Pao, after the small town of Gutian began promoting its \"Red Army rice\" after Xi had eaten a bowl (the dish is said to resemble an historic communist army staple featuring pumpkins, yams and sweet potatoes), the town reported an 80% growth in tourist visits over the previous year.\n\nREAD: 20 China travel tips\n\n3. Dumpling seller\n\nPerhaps the best illustration of the Xi Jinping effect on local cuisine is what's come to be known as the Qing-Feng dumpling incident. \n\nIn December 2013, Xi and a handful of government officials visited Beijing's Qing-Feng Steamed Dumpling Shop for lunch. \n\nXi queued, paid and picked up his RMB21 lunch by himself -- a bowl of baozi (steamed dumplings). \n\nThe dish became a craze in mainland China, turning the humble shop into an overnight sensation. \n\nThe shop remains a huge attraction with travelers. \n\nLining up for dumplings now takes at least an hour, according to local reports. \n\nDuring the October 2014 holiday following Xi's visit, different branches of Qing-Feng in Beijing recorded at least a 90% increase in orders -- mostly from tourists. \n\nMany overseas business interests called to inquire about franchise rights to the shop. \n\nVisitors can now order the \"President Set\" to try the meal Xi ate.\n\nIn an unexpected twist, the shop has also become a popular protest site for Chinese citizens who hoist banners and express dissatisfaction -- often protesting government corruption -- before heading in for steamed dumplings.\n\n4. Maldives promoter\n\nDuring a visit to Maldives in 2014, Xi commented that Chinese tourists should behave themselves and act in more civilized fashion overseas. \n\n\"Don't throw empty bottles everywhere,\" he instructed. \"Don't damage their coral reef. Eat less instant noodles. Eat more local seafood.\"\n\nThe instant noodle remark was a humorous reference to a widely publicized report in 2013 about a Maldives resort allegedly removing kettles from the rooms of Chinese tourists, fearing they'd only cook cup noodles instead of spending money at the resort's restaurant. \n\nWe can't confirm whether Chinese tourists are still munching instant noodles in their rooms, but Maldives travel package sales for some companies reportedly doubled after the president's visit.\n\nMORE: Librairie Avant-Garde: China's most beautiful bookshop\n\n5. Human marketing campaign\n\nThe Chinese president can be more effective than a tourism board campaign for attracting Chinese tourists. \n\nWherever Xi travels internationally, that country can expect a boost in Chinese tourists.\n\nIn addition to the Maldives, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and South Korea are some of the countries that have benefited from the Xi bump, with a rise in Chinese tourists following a visit by the president.\n\nPackage tours to Sri Lanka during the October 1st National Day holiday in 2014 were fully booked after Xi visited the country in September.\n\nSouth Korea received twice the amount of Chinese tourists during its 2014 holiday period, compared to the same period in 2013. \n\nAustralia and New Zealand promised to simplify visa procedures for Chinese tourists after Xi's visit. \n\nChinese online company Sina has introduced a special travel page promoting each of the places Xi has visited.\n\nTo keep up with Xi's movement, many Chinese netizens follow celeb fan blogger Xue Xi Fen Si Tuan, who sometimes releases Xi's official itineraries and whereabouts before China's official news agency.\n\n6. Macau gambling cooler\n\nAnyone who's visited a Macau casino knows what it's like to be surrounded by whales -- finding a betting table with a minimum wager of less than $100 per hand is almost impossible.\n\nAnd those are for ordinary gamblers. \n\nVIP gamblers in some private rooms reportedly are required to wager as much as $125,000 per hand.\n\nFor a while, those high stakes made Macau hog heaven for high-rolling government officials.\n\nThat was before Xi's high-profile anti-graft campaign aimed in part at government waste and corruption.\n\nAccording to industry experts, Xi's anti-corruption push has stopped a number of VIP gamblers from visiting Macau -- a major reason for a 27-28% plunge in the stock values of the six big casino operators in the city in 2014, according to the Financial Times.\n\nREAD: The next big thing in Chinese cuisine? \n\n7. Helping out lovebirds\n\nIn Hangzhou in eastern China, West Lake is a well known tourist attraction famed for its romantic lakeside views.\n\nAccording to state media China News Service, when West Lake was opened as a public park in 2002, Xi, who was then Secretary of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee, began offering suggestions on how to improve the visitor experience. \n\nOne of these included reducing the number of benches along the lake to provide more privacy for lovebirds.\n\n\"Xi thought that since the benches were too close to each other, it'd be very uncomfortable for the couples,\" Liu Ying, director of West Lake Scenic Area Management Committee, told online news platform The Paper.\n\nThe park complied, giving couples a chance to sneak a few more private moments, courtesy of their current president.\n\n8. Architectural guide\n\nIn October 2014, Xi called for less \"weird architecture\" to be built in the country, a reaction to the increasingly extravagant construction projects spurting up around China.\n\nXi cited the CCTV headquarters in Beijing, completed in 2008, which has earned the nickname \"The Big Pants\" for its resemblance to a pair of trousers.\n\nBeijing authorities responded swiftly by announcing plans to place restrictions on new building designs and materials.\n\nDoes Xi's conservative architectural taste mean the end of wacky and unusual structures in China, like these? \n\nWe hope not. \n\nMORE: China's spicy wonderland: How to eat like a local in Guizhou\n\n9.

It did not suspend immigration from those countries, but rather required an additional layer of screening for people coming from countries inhabited by known terrorists, like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan\u2014all Muslim-majority nations.  The screening included extensive interviews, fingerprinting, and for some, monthly checks.\n\nThe program being mentioned now was blasted by civil rights activists, and the ACLU told CNN in an interview this week that NSEERS \"actually made genuine efforts at trying to combat terrorism more difficult by destroying relationships with immigrant communities and actually negatively impacting the ability of the federal government to cooperate with foreign governments in fighting terrorism.\" \n\nThe program also ignores data, compiled by groups like The New America Foundation, which shows most domestic terror attacks are carried out by US-born or naturalized citizens. \n\nA DHS inspector generals' report in 2012 called the program \"obsolete,\" \"unreliable\" and an \"inefficient use of resources.\"\n\nA Muslim ban\n\nA registry for people from these countries is the latest iteration of a Trump proposal that began with a shocking call in December 2015 when he said he wanted \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" \n\nThat bold claim has become more muddled over time after Trump came under fire for nakedly targeting an entire religion.\n\nAs for Trump's developing policy, the source did not specify how many or which countries would considered high-risk but said \"it's a moving target\" given the ISIS threat. Not all countries with large Muslim populations are part of the current list, according to this source, who added that a complete ban of immigrants from high-risk countries is \"something we're prepared for, but it's unlikely ... all options are on the table.\"\n\nLast year, in response to a reporter's question, Trump said he would \"certainly implement\" a database on all Muslims living in the US. When pressed by other reporters, Trump later said he was in favor of a database tracking Syrian refugees in the US, though he never ruled out a broader Muslim ban.\n\nThe Trump transition team denied Thursday that he ever advocated for a registry.\n\n\"President-elect Trump has never advocated for any registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion, and to imply otherwise is completely false,\" spokesman Jason Miller said. \"The national registry of foreign visitors from countries with high terrorism activity that was in place during the Bush and Obama administrations gave intelligence and law enforcement communities additional tools to keep our country safe, but the President-elect plans on releasing his own vetting policies after he is sworn in.\"\n\nAG candidate architect of program\n\nOne of the architects of the NSEERS program helped Trump's campaign form immigration policy, and is reportedly being considered for attorney general, according to some news reports. Kris Kobach, the current secretary of state of Kansas, is a lightning rod for critics who have accused him of extreme racism and having ties to white nationalists. His involvement with the transition team is causing a ripple of alarm among civil rights and immigration activists.\n\nKobach told CNN he was part of the transition assisting with immigration, however a Trump spokesman said Thursday he is not officially an adviser. It is unclear if that changed after media reports on the new immigration plan were reported.\n\nRelated: Who could be in Trump's cabinet?\n\nKobach is almost single-handedly responsible for some of the nation's strictest immigration laws in at least a half-dozen states\u2014he not only writes the laws, but advocates for them and battles on their behalf in court. He is often cited as the chief architect of what Arizona's SB 1070, which was passed in 2010 and led to protests and state boycotts for encouraging the profiling of Latinos and other minorities.\n\nThe Arizona law requires police to determine a person's immigration status when there is \"reasonable suspicion\" that they are not legally in the US; it was partially upheld by the Supreme Court, but had other sections struck down by the court in 2011. \n\nModeling a new program off the NSEERS program could be more legally sound for Kobach and Trump since courts never ended it.\n\nThe 'show me your papers' law\n\nThe Arizona law, which critics call the \"show me your papers\" law, was fought by the ACLU and numerous other civil rights organizations, because it \"invites rampant racial profiling\" against Latinos, Asian-Americans and others based only on how they look or sound. \n\nKobach was also behind a change in voter registration in his home state of Kansas, requiring voters to show passports or birth certificates to register to vote, although that law has suffered setbacks in court.\n\nKobach has also spearheaded and pushed through restrictive voter laws for immigrants in at least six states, including Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky; he has often himself been the attorney in court representing the states trying to push the new laws. Kobach has worked with groups including the Federation for American Immigration Reform that have pushed for tough measures on undocumented immigrants. The Southern Poverty Law Center has listed FAIR as a hate group since 2007.\n\nWhile voter fraud by immigrants has been proven to rarely occur, Kobach has said it is a real problem and the reason harsher measures are needed.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it rarely gets prosecuted,\" Kobach said in an February 2015 interview. \"This is not a victimless crime. Every time an alien, legal or illegal, participated in an election. That effectively cancels out the vote of the US citizen, effectively disenfranchises that US citizen. And we have many cases in Kansas of aliens getting on our voter rolls and voting. Sometimes and just not realizing they are breaking the law. Sometimes it is part of the coordinated effort.\"\n\nACLU: Kobach's policies a 'history of utter failure'\n\nThe ACLU has been involved in many of the lawsuits opposing Kobach in various states.\n\n\"The history of his policies is a history of utter failure -- failure in the courts, and failure on the ground,\" said Omar Jadwat, a staff attorney at the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, speaking to CNN on Wednesday.\n\n\"The notion that he pushed around the country that state and local police have inherent authority to work as immigration agents, his proof of citizenship requirement that he imposed on US citizen voters in Kansas, the local laws that he pushed, the anti-DREAMer lawsuits that he attempted. If you look at those policies, and you think about what has been the fate of those policies in the courts, they have all failed miserably to stand up to legal scrutiny and have been found either unconstitutional or illegal on other grounds or both,\" said Jadwat.\n\nIn an interview earlier this week, Kobach told CNN that he believes that the US shouldn't wait for undocumented immigrants to be convicted of a crime before deportation, citing a lack of resources to prosecute every crime. \"This guy's is a known gang member. He's gotten arrested multiple times. Sure, they haven't convicted him yet, but we ought to get him out of the country and that is what this administration, the Trump administration, will probably do and what the Obama administration has not been doing,\" he told CNN's Brianna Keilar.\n\nStrong proponent for wall along US-Mexico border\n\nKobach is also known for his views that numerous undocumented immigrants will leave the US, or \"self-deport,\" if more restrictive immigration laws are enacted, and more undocumented immigrants are detained. But in the absence of self-deportation, Kobach has strongly upheld the idea of mass deportations when undocumented immigrants are found.\n\nHe has been labeled a racist by the Southern Poverty Law Center and also the ACLU. In an online publication, the SPLC writes:\n\n\"Given Kobach's racially charged main efforts of recent years -- working to restrict voting rights and curtail immigration -- his relationship with racist groups isn't too difficult to understand. Maybe it's time to question Kobach's claims that he is simply pursuing these issues to enforce the law. His strange bedfellows in the white nationalist movement would certainly agree that fewer immigrants and stricter voting procedures are a good thing, because, well, that would stop brown and black people from being empowered.\"\n\nKobach is a strong proponent for a wall along the US-Mexico border and other measures to stop undocumented immigrants from entering the US, and at the Republican convention this summer, he successfully petitioned to have language in the official platform call for a wall on the southern border, in line with Trump's campaign slogan.\n\nThough he is hardly known outside of immigration and conservative circles, Kobach is cited even by critics as one of the best thinkers and intellects among his peers. He is not only Ivy-league educated, but also has an elite international pedigree, with degrees from Harvard, Oxford and Yale Law School. \n\nAn adviser to Mitt Romney during his run for President, Kobach was chair of the Kansas Republican Party from 2007-2009, and was elected secretary of state there in 2010.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.21172618865967, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1405, "FairnessVirtue": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 14, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 9.40985943282, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 33, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 33, "mft_sum": 77, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161118000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 7.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 5.480427046263349, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/03/health/texas-pesticide-deaths/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 717, "scraper_regex": 821}}, "headline": "Texas pesticide deaths: Chemical may have sickened, but cleanup was fatal", "wordcount_as_scraped": 821, "date": "20170103180000", "story_content": "The act of watering the ground after applying pesticide may seem innocuous, but it was enough to kill four children in Texas. \n\nOne was a high school senior on the brink of graduation. The other three were her little brothers; the youngest was 7 years old. \n\nOn Tuesday, Amarillo police explained what went wrong: Some of the family members started feeling sick Monday after the pesticide was applied under their mobile home. So one of the residents tried to dilute it with water. \n\nIt was fatal mistake. \n\nHow exactly did the children die?\n\nAfter someone applied the pesticide -- aluminum phosphide -- under the mobile home, a family member tried to wash it away, said Capt. Larry Davis of the Amarillo Fire Department.\n\nBut aluminum phosphide mixed with water creates toxic phosphine gas, which can cause excess fluid in the lungs and respiratory failure. \n\nThere were 10 people inside the mobile home at the time, Davis said. Emergency crews arrived at the home just after 5 a.m. Monday after receiving a call that people there were sick. \n\nIn addition to the four children killed, five other people from inside the home were hospitalized. \n\nWho were the victims? \n\nFamily friend Terry Rodriguez identified the four siblings as 17-year-old Yasmeen Balderas and her younger brothers Johnny, Josue and Felipe Balderas. \n\n\"Yasmeen was a senior at Palo Duro HS. She was a quiet simple girl, looking forward to graduation,\" Rodriguez wrote on a GoFundMe page set up to help the family. \n\n\"Josue wanted to be a priest and was an alter server at St Lawrence. He was a gentle soul, slow to anger and quick to provide comfort,\" Rodriguez wrote. \n\n\"Johnny was a comic. So smart and so aware of his strengths and weaknesses. He was the first to laugh at himself and never met a stranger who wasn't just a friend in the making.\"\n\nFelipe \"was everyone's friend,\" Rodriguez said. \n\nWho is responsible? \n\nThe Amarillo Police Department is investigating and will turn over its findings to the local district attorney's office to see whether any criminal charges should be filed, Officer Jeb Hilton said. \n\nBut so far, this appears to be a case of accidental poisoning, Davis said.\n\nHe said the man who lives at the mobile home and who applied the aluminum phosphide on the ground got the pesticide from a friend. \n\nAluminum phosphide is used to kill insects and burrowing rodents, especially in grain stores. But it can be deadly to humans when mixed with water. \n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency lists aluminum phosphide in \"Toxicity Category I\" -- the most toxic category. Specifically, the EPA points to the \"acute effects via the inhalation route.\"\n\nHow common are pesticide deaths? \n\nAn estimated 1 million to 5 million cases of pesticide poisoning occur every year, \"resulting in several thousand fatalities among agricultural workers,\" the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations said. \n\n\"Most of these poisonings occur in the developing world where safe health standards can be inadequate or non-existent,\" the FAO said. \n\nBut pesticide deaths have also happened in developed countries. Last year, an 8-month-old Canadian girl died after her mother used phosphine tablets as a pesticide in their home, CNN partner CBC reported. \n\nPesticides are also a very common method of suicide, especially in low-income, agricultural parts of the world, according to a World Health Organization report. \n\n\"In attempted suicide, which is considerably more frequent than completed suicide, pesticide poisoning results in temporary or permanent disability,\" the WHO said. \n\nWhat precautions should you take with pesticides? \n\nIn addition to following the label's instructions exactly, the National Pesticide Information Center recommends: \n\n-- Mixing pesticides outside or in well-ventilated areas\n\n-- Making sure children and pets are away from the area where you're mixing and applying pesticides\n\n-- Removing  personal items, such as toys, clothing, or tools from the spray area to avoid contamination\n\n-- Mixing only what you need immediately to avoid storing or disposing of excess pesticide\n\n-- Having a plan in case of a pesticide spill. Have paper towels, sawdust or cat litter, garbage bags and non-absorbent gloves nearby to contain the spill. \"Avoid using excessive amounts of water, as this may only spread the pesticide and could be harmful to the environment.\"\n\nHave there been other high-profile pesticide cases? \n\nYes.

Black women played a crucial role in the pool, providing mathematical data for NASA's first successful space missions, including Glenn's pioneering orbital spaceflight.\n\nTheir work barely earned a mention in pop culture space tributes until this year, thanks to a best-selling novel and a forthcoming film that's getting major Oscar buzz.\n\n\"Hidden Figures,\" starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, tells the story of three women from the pool. The film is based on Margot Lee Shetterly's bestselling book by the same name, which spans several decades and characters at Langley. \n\nHenson stars as Katherine Johnson, the 2015 National Medal of Freedom recipient who calculated the trajectory for America's first trip to space with Alan Shepherd's 1961 mission; Spencer as Johnson's supervisor, Dorothy Vaughan; and Mon\u00e1e as Mary Jackson, who rose from mathematician to engineer to the mentor for women and minorities.\n\nA pivotal scene in the film features Glenn. Johnson's work was held in such high regard in its time that Glenn, who died on Thursday, was aware of it. Computers were so new that even people at NASA were skeptical of them, and Glenn requested that Johnson personally confirm its calculations before his trip three times around Earth. \n\nA day and a half later, she proved the computer right.\n\nConsidered more patient and detail-oriented than men (and they could be paid less), the first women were hired in 1935 to do the integral but time-consuming work of reading, calculating and plotting test data to free up engineers for research projects. \n\nFollowing an executive order prohibiting racial discrimination in the defense industry, Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, NACA's main research center, began recruiting black people with college degrees in the 1940s for the computer pool. For years the women occupied a segregated wing, \"West Area Computing,\" and used separate facilities. But there was no denying the value of their contribution.\n\nIn interviews ever since, Johnson has resisted taking full credit for the work. As she said in a 2010 interview, \"We always worked as a team. It's never just one person.\"\n\nHere's more about Johnson and her colleagues:\n\nKatherine Johnson\n\nJohnson was born in 1918 in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, where education for black people ended in eighth grade. Recognizing their youngest daughter's talent for math, her parents sent her to high school on the campus of West Virginia State Institute, a black college 100 miles away. It paid off and she graduated from high school at 14 and graduated from West Virginia State in 1937 at 18.\n\nLike many women of her time she became a teacher -- but her sights were set on becoming a research mathematician. When she learned of a job opening at Langley for black women with math degrees she and her husband moved their three daughters to Newport News, Virginia. She started in in the segregated West Area Computing Group in 1953 under Dorothy Vaughan. After just two weeks, she transferred to the facility's Flight Research Division. She worked there for years until the Soviet satellite Sputnik kicked off the space race between the US and the USSR, spurring the transformation of NACA into America's space agency, NASA. \n\nShe pushed her way into briefings traditionally attended only by men and secured a place in the inner circle of the American Space Program. She worked on trajectories for Shepard's Mercury flight, America's first manned spaceflight, and earned a measure of fame as \"the girl\"  -- as female mathematicians were called -- who double-checked the output for Glenn's spaceflight. Her work helped map the moon's surface ahead of the 1969 landing and played a role in the safe return of the Apollo 13 astronauts. She retired in 1989 and lives in Virginia.\n\nDorothy Vaughan\n\nVaughan was born in 1910 in Kansas City, Missouri and graduated from Wilberforce University in Zenia, Ohio, in 1926. She was hired at Langley in 1943 in response to high wartime demand for aeronautical research data, leaving behind a job as a math teacher in Farmville, Virginia. She rose from mathematician to supervisor of West Area Computing Group, making her NACA's first black supervisor. She held onto the role, overseeing Johnson and Mary Jackson, until NACA made the transition to NASA and segregated facilities were abolished.\n\nShe joined the new Analysis and Computation Division, a racially and gender-integrated group on the cutting edge of electronic computing. She became an expert FORTRAN programmer and contributed to the Scout Launch Vehicle Program before retiring in 1971. She unsuccessfully sought another management position in Langley. She died in 2008.\n\nMary Jackson\n\nJackson was born in Hampton, Virginia, in 1921. She graduated from Hampton Institute in 1942 with degrees in physical science and mathematics and became a teacher before starting her career at Langley, and later on NASA.\n\nShe started working under Vaughan in the 1950s, focusing on processing data from wind tunnel experiments and experimental flights. Later on, she worked with flight test engineers and eventually became an engineer. As her career progressed she worked to help fellow women and minorities advance their careers through educational attainment. After 30 years she moved into administration and took a job in NASA's Equal Opportunity office, overseeing affirmative action programs and career development for women. She died in 2005.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.410256415605545, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 882, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.015677899680001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161210090000, "FairnessVice": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.17460317460317, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/opinions/obama-saved-manning-life-keisling-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "President Obama may have saved Chelsea Manning's life", "wordcount_as_scraped": 658, "date": "20170120200000", "story_content": "On Tuesday, days before leaving office, President Barack Obama granted clemency to 273 people. Among them was Chelsea Manning, a transgender woman whose life has been endangered by cruel and abusive conditions throughout her nearly seven years in a men's prison. She will now be released in May instead of serving out the rest of her original 35-year sentence, but she has already been incarcerated for longer than any other American ever charged with leaking information to the media. \n\nObama's act of mercy may very well have saved Manning's life. And this is not an exaggeration. There continue to be serious problems with inadequate medical care and the prolonged use of solitary confinement in our overcrowded prisons and jails, though the Department of Justice under the Obama administration has made great strides towards rectifying these problems. Incarcerated transgender individuals often face these issues most acutely, and future administrations would do well to continue down the path of reducing harm for this vulnerable population.\n\nManning is no exception. Throughout her years in prison, the military has continuously sought to unconstitutionally deny  her appropriate, medically necessary transition-related health care, despite military psychiatrists recognizing that she had gender dysphoria requiring treatment. This went against recommendations by major medical experts like the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association. The military eventually made limited concessions only after Manning filed a lawsuit against the Department of Defense.\n\nManning is perhaps the most high-profile transgender woman currently in prison, but her experience is far from unique. Results from the U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS), which we released last month, illustrate this in stark terms. Of respondents who had been incarcerated in the past year, more than one third (37%) who had been taking hormone medications before being incarcerated were prohibited from taking their hormones while incarcerated.\n\nEven worse, Manning spent the first 11 months of her incarceration in solitary confinement, a horrific and unnecessary practice that the United Nations considers to be torture and which the Obama administration has worked to limit in civilian prisons. Last September, Manning was placed back in solitary confinement as a cruel and dangerous punishment for attempting suicide.\n\nMistreatment of transgender people who are incarcerated is, unfortunately, common. For USTS respondents who had been incarcerated in the last year, the rate of physical and/or sexual assault by staff or other inmates was five times higher than comparable rates for the general US prison population. \n\nEven after Manning walks free in May, transgender people all over the nation -- particularly black transgender women -- will continue to face discrimination, mistreatment and violence while incarcerated. Nine percent of black respondents to the USTS had been incarcerated, as opposed to 2% of respondents at large, and a 2013 study found that transgender women were 13 times more likely to be sexually assaulted in prison than the general prison population. \n\nFrom ensuring that incarcerated transgender people no longer face incredibly high rates of sexual abuse, to making sure that they can receive basic, medically necessary transition-related care, our organization will continue fighting to improve conditions  for incarcerated transgender people, and to ensure that the progress we have made so far is not undone.\n\nIn terms of Obama's act of mercy, it does not matter whether Chelsea Manning is a heroine or a villain. She has already served longer, and as a transgender woman she has endured far worse punishment than anyone else convicted of a similar crime -- worse than any human being should have to endure. \n\nThroughout his administration, Obama has worked to reduce mass incarceration and inhumane conditions in prisons, including the extreme abuse too often faced by transgender prisoners. He has been a staunch advocate for the dignity, humanity and equality of all people, including transgender people.\n\nCommuting Manning's sentence exemplifies the American values that President Obama advanced throughout his presidency, and it should be an example for the incoming administration, which should keep in place the protections that already exist for transgender prisoners.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.36111116409302, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 668, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.6628760938, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170120200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.2934131736527004, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/18/health/tom-price-hhs-on-the-issues-profile-aca/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 874, "scraper_regex": 929}}, "headline": "Tom Price, HHS nominee, on abortion, guns and other health issues", "wordcount_as_scraped": 929, "date": "20170118220000", "story_content": "Congressman Tom Price is President Donald Trump's pick for secretary of Health and Human Services. If confirmed by the Senate, Price would oversee 11 divisions, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health. \n\nThe Georgia Republican would be just the third physician ever appointed to this role. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who was first elected to represent Georgia's sixth district in 2004, after serving four terms in the Georgia State Senate.\n\nOne of Obamacare's most vocal critics from its beginning, Price has introduced legislation to the House of Representatives proposing how he would replace President Obama's signature piece of legislation.\n\nPrice would not just be at the helm of Republicans' efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He'd also oversee policies and budgets that affect nearly every facet of Americans' physical and mental health.\n\nHere's what Tom Price has said on five major health issues facing the country today.\n\nAbortion\n\nPrice is anti-abortion and has voted against funding for Planned Parenthood. After doctored videos of employees discussing fetal body party were published, Price characterized the organization's practices as \"barbaric.\" Planned Parenthood has called Price a \"grave threat to women's health.\" \n\n\"Regardless of where they stand on abortion, most Americans agree it should not be funded by taxpayer subsidies,\" Price said in a 2010 statement. \"Giving abortion providers (funds) for other activities just frees up an equal sum of money to support their abortion practices.\"\n\n\"It's time to end this sickening taxpayer subsidy of abortions,\" he said.\n\nCurrently federal money is not being used to perform abortions in the US except to save the life of the pregnant woman or in cases of rape or incest, which the federal Medicaid program currently mandates.  \n\nPlanned Parenthood says it is reimbursed by the federal government (mostly through Medicaid) for specific medical procedures that do not include abortions. But some critics maintain that the money in Planned Parenthood's budget is \"fungible\" and can be reallocated.\n\nPlanned Parenthood says only about 3% of the services it provides are abortions. STD screening and treatment accounts for about 45% of services provided; contraception accounts for about 31%; cancer screening and prevention accounts for 7%; and other health services, such as pregnancy tests or prenatal services, account for 13%, according to the organization's 2014-2015 annual report. \n\nCancer\n\nAfter former Vice President Joe Biden announced in June an ambitious, $1 billion \"moonshot\" agenda to reduce cancer deaths, currently the second leading killer of Americans.\n\n\"We're all in favor of increasing funding for cancer research,\" Price told STAT News last year. \"The problem that the (Obama) administration has is that they always want to add funding on, they never want to decrease funding somewhere else. That's what needs to happen.\"\n\nMental health and guns\n\nLast year, Price told Georgia's Marietta Daily Journal newspaper that the country's mental health system needed to get better at diagnosing and treating at-risk individuals in order to stem violent crimes.\n\n\"To do otherwise would mean we continue to fail not only those afflicted with mental illness, but also their families, our communities and our nation,\" Price said.\n\nPrice asserted that when violence has taken place, gun ownership has protected -- not harmed -- those at the scene of the crime.\n\n\"In fact, guns are used more often to protect lives, not take lives. Steps to remove firearms from the hands of law-abiding citizens endanger those very citizens,\" he said.\n\nA 2014 meta-analysis, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, found that access to firearms is associated with increased risk for suicide and being the victim of homicide. There is currently no independent evidence showing that gun ownership is associated with a decreased risk of gun-related deaths.\n\nSome experts think that the CDC has done little research on gun violence because doing so may encourage legislators aligned with the National Rifle Association to take away funding from the agency. \n\nStem cell research\n\nPrice has been outspoken against research that involves embryonic stem cells.\n\nIn 2005, Price spoke with Georgia's Athens Banner-Herald newspaper about the \"ethical dilemma\" of stem cell research. Embryonic stem cells, which have the potential to treat myriad medical conditions, are controversial because they derive from early embryos.\n\nThe cells are of interest for research because they have the potential to develop into many different cell types, and so scientists believe they can be used to generate cells and tissues that could be used for cell-based therapies.\n\n\"There are people who believe any form of embryonic stem cell research necessitates the destruction of human life,\" Price said. \"I can't overestimate the importance of that statement.\" And for people who believe that, \"stem cell scientists are threatening your fundamental principles,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health's current guidelines on human stem cell research, embryonic stem cells are eligible for research with NIH funding if they were created using in vitro fertilization and are no longer needed or were donated by individuals seeking reproductive treatment.\n\nPrice has voted against expanding embryonic stem cell research. As HHS secretary he would oversee NIH grants to research on embryonic stem cells.\n\nMore on Price \n\nThomas Edmunds Price was born in Lansing, Michigan, in 1954, and grew up in Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit. Price earned his bachelor's and medical degree at the University of Michigan. \n\nIn 1997, Price was sworn in Georgia State Senate. Then, after serving four terms in the Senate and nearly 20 years in private practice, Price was elected to the US House of Representatives in 2004.

It will require persistent feedback and input from community members.\"\n\nThe decree was filed in federal court, and -- after the expected approval by a judge -- a period of community input will be followed by the selection of a monitor to oversee the police department.  \n\n\"We have come a long, long way,\" said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \n\nThe announcement follows a scathing Justice Department report in August that said the unconstitutional practices of some of the city's 2,600 officers led to disproportionate rates of stops, searches and arrests of black residents, and excessive use of force against juveniles and those with mental health disabilities.\n\nThe report, which covered data from 2010 to 2016, attributed the practices to \"systemic deficiencies\" in training, policies and accountability structures that \"fail to equip officers with the tools they need to police effectively.\" \n\nGray's death touched off protests and riots in Baltimore and other cities and fueled a debate over racial bias in policing that drew federal scrutiny. \n\nAttorney Billy Murphy, who represents Gray's family, called the agreement \"a revolution in policing in Baltimore.\"\n\n \"They are gratified that if the police department is finally reformed in the right way, their son did not die completely in vain,\" he said of the family.  \n\nCity officials in September 2015 approved a $6.4 million settlement on all civil claims tied to Gray's death. \n\nGene Ryan, president of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3, declined comment on the consent decree, saying the police union was excluded from negotiations and had not seen the document.  \n\n\"As we were not afforded an advance copy of the agreement, neither our rank and file members who will be most affected, nor our attorneys, have had a chance to read the final product and, as such, we will not have a comment now,\" he said in a statement.   \n\nLynch on Thursday said the Baltimore agreement is binding. \n\n\"It will live on past this administration,\" she said.  \n\nThe decree comes in the same week as confirmation hearings for Sen. Jeff Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to head the Justice Department and days before Lynch steps down. Sessions' record has raised eyebrows with rights organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which considers the senator from Alabama \"hostile to consent decrees.\" \n\nThe ACLU cites a forward that Sessions wrote for a 2008 report published by Alabama Policy Institute in which he states: \"One of the most dangerous, and rarely discussed, exercises of raw power is the issuance of expansive court decrees. Consent decrees have a profound effect on our legal system as they constitute an end run around the democratic process.\"\n\nSession's skepticism on police reform is in sharp contrast to the Lynch's Justice Department under the Obama administration. \n\nThe department's Civil Rights Division has investigated 25 law enforcement agencies over civil rights abuses during the past seven years; 14 investigations have ended in consent decrees. The department is enforcing an additional 19 agreements with law enforcement agencies.\n\nSessions' testimony on police reform\n\nDuring Sessions' confirmation hearing Tuesday, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, asked the attorney general nominee whether he would commit to maintaining and enforcing consent decrees. He responded that a decree isn't \"necessarily a bad thing\" but said he remained wary of lawsuits against police departments.\n\n\"I think there is concern that good police officers and good departments can be sued by the Department of Justice when you just have individuals within a department that have done wrong,\" Sessions said. \n\n\"These lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness, and we need to be careful before we do that.\" \n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, followed by asking Sessions whether the Justice Department would help if cities asked for assistance. The nominee said, if asked, it should help. \n\n\"I think it's a good thing that police departments might call on federal investigators,\" Sessions said. \n\nYet he cautioned against undermining police departments.\n\n\"It really is important that people trust police departments and the police departments have respect from their communities, and when you don't have that, people's safety is at risk.\" Sessions said. \n\nChicago investigation\n\nBesides Baltimore, police departments in Ville Platte, Louisiana, and Chicago have also been under the Justice Department's radar.   \n\nThe department soon is expected to release the results of an investigation into Chicago police. \n\nKnown as a \"pattern and practice\" inquiry, it's expected to focus on use of force, deadly force accountability and how the Chicago force \"tracks and treats\" those incidents, Lynch said when she announced the investigation in December 2015.\n\nIn an unrelated news conference Wednesday, the attorney general said she couldn't comment on when the Chicago report would be released but said Justice Department officials have been working \"very diligently\" with the city and police department.\n\n\"We do intend to push through and ... give the city of Chicago, both law enforcement and the communities, the help that they deserve so that they can in fact work on this issues,\" Lynch said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.0151133537292503, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 740, "FairnessVirtue": 11, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.7239452996800004, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170112110000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.0, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/opinions/political-scientists-on-trump/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "The scary part of an unpredictable President", "wordcount_as_scraped": 986, "date": "20161110190000", "story_content": "Just days ago, hundreds of the most prominent political scientists in the United States -- most of whom usually stay far removed from the partisan fray of electoral politics -- did something extraordinary: They penned a public letter to express their deep concern about Donald Trump. \"A Trump Presidency,\" they wrote, \"would pose a grave threat to American democracy and to other democratic governments around the world.\"\n\nI was one of the signatories to this letter. Since the election, Trump has moderated his tone. Today, the ordinary mechanisms of a peaceful transition of power are on full display, with Barack Obama welcoming his democratically elected successor into the White House. But, like many of my colleagues, I still believe that Trump's willingness throughout his campaign to break with the most basic democratic norms should be seen as a serious warning sign.\n\nIn a stable democracy, political leaders promise to abide by the outcome of the election. They recognize that their political opponents are legitimate. They respect the independence of the legal system. And they defend the right of the press to criticize office-holders.\n\nTrump, by contrast, repeatedly implied that he would not accept the outcome of the election if Hilary Clinton had won. He has consistently promised to \"lock her up.\" He has attacked the judiciary, claiming that Judge Gonzalez Curiel is biased because he is \"Mexican.\" And he has incited the most violent hatred against members of the press, promising to open up libel laws if elected.\n\nI fear for what might come next. As a candidate, Trump relished in destroying every norm of political tradition and decency, staking out an openly authoritarian pitch to his base -- and was rewarded with a handsome victory.

Could he order federal law enforcement agencies to disregard due process when they chase after black suspects, or police Muslim communities, or round up undocumented immigrants, or beat back mass protests? Could he order the military to target the families of terrorists? And could he ignore the protestations of the Supreme Court when it tries to overrule him?\n\nPerhaps not. But we simply cannot know. And that's the scary part.\n\nAs political scientists, we are used to studying what is likely to happen, not what we might do to influence the outcome. And we tend to be interested in the structural factors that influence general regularities, not the ways in which individuals might help to sway a particular case. This is another habit we have to break now. For how the next four years will play out depends in important ways on the actions of real-life people, who can take the honorable or the dishonorable course of action, discover the best in themselves or go down in history as enablers of democracy's demise. \n\nThe person facing the most important decision is Donald Trump. However ugly a campaign he ran, he is now the President-elect of the United States. The anger he has harnessed is visceral and the power he holds immense. He can try to look beyond the easy and incendiary slogans of the past months, working hard to improve the lives of the millions who put their trust in him. Or he can continue to spout slogans, to look for easy scapegoats and to put his own interests above those of the country. What happens to this country -- and whether Trump will be remembered by future generations as an unlikely hero or an arch villain -- is chiefly up to him.\n\nIt is also up to the old guard of the Republican Party. For all of Trump's power, his ability to do damage to the republic could be held in check by the fact that many elected legislators from his own party retain a deep commitment to the Constitution, and have been deeply dismayed by many of his statements. If Trump gives in to his worst instincts, the fate of the republic may hinge on their ability to summon the courage they have so far lacked.\n\nThe media are crucial, too. During the campaign, they have oscillated between calling out Trump's lies and treating him as just another mainstream candidate. If Trump starts to violate the Constitution or to intimidate his critics, journalists of all political persuasions have to speak out against him with one voice -- lest attacks on free speech be normalized. Yes, they may come under pressure from the administration. And yes, they will lose many readers and viewers. But for journalists to normalize a President who tries to muzzle the press is to dig their own graves.\n\nThe most important agents, however, are all of us -- as citizens or parishioners, members of charities or country clubs, teachers or shareholders. As Hillary Clinton said, we owe Trump \"a chance to lead.\" But we must also defend \"the rule of law, the principle that we're all equal in rights and dignity, and the freedom of worship and expression.\" If Trump should decide to encroach on those, it is incumbent on all of us to resist him in any way we can: by taking to the streets, by refusing to carry out illegal orders, by risking our lives and livelihoods if that turns out to be the only way.\n\nIn the end, democracies are only as strong as their citizens' lived commitment to its basic principles. Trump may yet turn out to be an honorable President. But if he doesn't, the next years will afford us an opportunity -- unprecedented in this magnitude in the history of the American republic -- to demonstrate the depth of our commitment to the founding principles to which we so readily pay lip service. The fate of liberal democracy, from coast to coast and far beyond these shining shores, may depend on it.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.4630541801452597, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 950, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.1360342382999997, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161110190000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 3.78947368421053, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/02/us/gatlinburg-fires/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1370, "scraper_regex": 1126}}, "headline": "Gatlinburg fires: 13 dead; some residents allowed to check properties", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1126, "date": "20161202140000", "story_content": "The number of people killed as a direct or indirect result of this week's wildfires in eastern Tennessee has risen to 13, though emergency crews still have more areas to check, officials said Friday.\n\nAnd for the first time since Monday night's flames swept through the Gatlinburg area, authorities allowed some residents to get into the charred areas to see their properties and collect anything they can salvage, Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters said at a news conference.\n\nHere's a look at some of the latest information about the fires that swept into this resort-heavy area of Tennessee:\n\n13 killed; some names released\n\nOf the 13 who died, 12 were killed in the fires, and one person had a heart attack after fleeing and being exposed to smoke, Waters and the county's assistant medical examiner, Dr. Vincent Tolley, said.\n\nAmong the dead, Tolley said, was a couple vacationing from Memphis: Jon and Janet Summers, both 61. They were found in Gatlinburg's Chalet Village cabin rental area.\n\nTheir three sons, who were separated from the couple as the fires swept through the area, were found unconscious. Jared was released from the hospital Thursday while Wesley and Branson Summers remain hospitalized, according to CNN affiliate WKRN. \n\nThe family tried to evacuate by car but a fallen tree had blocked their path, said Jim Summers, brother of Jon Summers, at a press conference Friday. \n\n\"They got out of the car and somehow they got separated,\" he said about the couple and their three sons. \"And then after that, we don't know.\"\n\nHis three nephews \"went through walls of fire. The entire road and on both sides of the road, when the wind blew up, it fanned the flames into this incredible inferno and they had to run through it all the way to the bottom of the mountain,\" he said.\n\nThe fact that they survived was \"completely miraculous,\" said cousin Marsha Crownover. The three were smiling and grateful to see friends and family, she said. \n\nA doctor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center said Wesley and Branson Summers would undergo surgery Monday requiring skin grafts. \n\nGatlinburg resident Alice Hagler also died in the firestorm, her family said earlier this week.\n\nThe fire, which in part spread from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park into the eastern Tennessee resort city, burned about 1,000 buildings in Sevier County, including hundreds in Gatlinburg, and injured about 85 people, Waters said.\n\nMore buildings to be searched\n\nFirefighters and other responders have done preliminary searches in about 90% of the burned areas, Waters said. It has taken days to comb through the area, in part because downed trees and power lines and other debris made some areas difficult to reach.\n\nA reporter asked Waters whether he expected the casualty number to rise as the remaining area is searched.\n\n\"We don't know ... but we hope and pray that it does not,\" Waters said.\n\nThe fire's origins\n\nThe fires had two main origins. In part, it was an extension of a blaze that began days earlier on a trail in the mountains 10 miles south of the city, National Park Service spokeswoman Dana Soehn said. Strong winds that began Sunday helped the fire spread into the Gatlinburg area the next day.\n\nThe National Park Service asked for the public's help to report \"every person who hiked, or knew someone who hiked on the Chimney Tops Trail on November 23,\" said Cassius Cash, superintendent of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He announced a new hotline to take tips from the public.  \n\nInvestigators suspect the trail fire was \"caused by human,\" Cash said. ATF and the NPS are investigating. \n\nVolunteers flock to Volunteer State to help fire victims \n\nBut some of the flames were sparked by power lines that fell in heavy winds in and near the city, officials said.\n\nWildfires have burned in many parts of the Southeast for weeks, fueled by the region's worst drought in nearly a decade.\n\nHow to help those affected by Tennessee wildfires\n\n'Nothing in our pockets'\n\nOfficials will post information about damaged properties on a Facebook page, Gatlinburg Mayor Mike Werner said.\n\nTrevor Cates, 37, whose home was destroyed, also lost the church he attends. On Tuesday he managed to walk through the charred remains of the Banner Baptist Church's buildings north of the city.\n\n\"We had practically no warning,\" Cates said Thursday. \"My wife and son ran through the home and grabbed a laundry basket full of pictures, our fire safe, my two Bibles, some changes of clothes and our two cats and one dog.\"\n\nHe said insurance would leave him with no more mortgage payments but \"nothing in our pockets.\" He and his family are temporarily staying at his parents' house.\n\n\"So ... now we literally are going to start off with less than we even had the first day we were married,\" he said. \"The positive thing, obviously, is we have our two kids, our animals and each other. God knows best. He always has, he always will.\"\n\nAndrew Duncan sent a camera-equipped drone over Gatlinburg's east Foothills area, where he and his family had just sold a cabin they had owned for 20 years. That cabin and many others, as well as a home he was about to buy, were destroyed, he said. \n\n\"There were cars left in ditches where people wrecked them trying to escape,\" he said Thursday. \"Small fires are still burning within the structures, and those that did burn appeared to be total losses. We didn't see any partially burned structures.\"\n\nFate of woman, daughters unclear\n\nAuthorities have yet to say anything about the whereabouts of three members of a Gatlinburg family who were reported missing.\n\nMichael Reed told reporters earlier this week that he has been desperate to find out what happened to his wife and two daughters, from whom he was separated Monday night.\n\nReed and his family were in their Gatlinburg-area home when word spread that a nearby fire was burning out of control. He and his 15-year-old son left in the family's only vehicle to see what side of the road the fire was on.\n\nHe told CNN he got stuck in traffic as people fled. He received a panicked call from his wife, Constance, 34.\n\n\"She ... said there were flames across the street from the house. I told her to call 911,\" he said. He rushed back to the home.\n\n\"The road was on fire and every house was engulfed in flames. I thought she'd be standing in the driveway.\"\n\nSince then, he's been trying to find out what happened to Constance and their daughters, Chloe, 12, and Lily, 9. He said authorities haven't been able to find them.\n\n\"We're just hoping for a miracle,\" Reed told WATE on Tuesday.

James Mattis as his secretary of defense, he announced Thursday in Cincinnati at the beginning of his post-election tour.\n\n\"We are going to appoint 'Mad Dog' Mattis as our secretary of defense. But we're not announcing it until Monday so don't tell anybody,\" Trump said at his rally, adding later, \"They say he's the closest thing to Gen. George Patton that we have and it's about time.\"\n\nMattis, 66, would join a Trump national security team that already includes retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser and Rep. Mike Pompeo as CIA director.\n\nThe retired four-star general, known as \"Mad Dog,\" was lauded for his leadership of Marines in the 2004 Battle of Falluja in Iraq -- one of the bloodiest of the war.\n\nBut he attracted controversy in 2005 when he said \"it's fun to shoot some people\" while addressing service members in San Diego.\n\nMattis' selection could put him in position to temper both Flynn and Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and an appointee of President Barack Obama -- whose generals Trump has said he distrusts.\n\nMattis has already proven to have the President-elect's ear. After meeting at Trump's New Jersey golf club last month, Trump said Mattis gave him a new perspective on waterboarding, a torture tool he has pledged to reinstate.\n\n\"General Mattis is a strong, highly dignified man. I met with him at length and I asked him that question. I said, 'What do you think of waterboarding?'\" Trump told The New York Times. \"He said -- I was surprised -- he said, 'I've never found it to be useful.' He said,\n\n 'I've always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.'\"\n\n\"I'm not saying it changed my mind. Look, we have people that are chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cages and we're not allowed to waterboard,\" Trump said. But I'll tell you what, I was impressed by that answer.\"\n\nEligible?\n\nMattis would also need a waiver from Congress in order to be confirmed. A decades-old legal statute bars service members from quickly entering civilian positions, which would otherwise prevent Mattis from being eligible for the job.\n\nThe ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee subcommittee on personnel, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York issued a statement Thursday night that she'll oppose approving such a waiver, saying, \"Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a ranking member of the House Intelligence Commmittee, told CNN's Jim Sciutto Wednesday, however, that the regulation would pose as more of an inconvenience for Mattis's confirmation, rather than barring him from the job. \n\n\"It will certainly be an issue. I don't ultimately think it will be a bar because I think he is so well thought of that he can overcome peoples' reservations of that,\" Schiff said. \"My guess is because his reputation is so strong and, frankly, because there's enough concern among Democrats about some of the President-elect's other choices, they'll be a desire to amend the statute if that's what' necessary and I believe it would be necessary.\n\nHigh regard\n\nIn Mattis, Trump has a nominee who was held in high regard throughout the ranks of the Marine Corps during his 44 years of service. A seasoned combat commander, he led a task force into southern Afghanistan in 2001 and a Marine division at the time of the Iraq invasion in 2003. \n\nHe was later promoted to run US Central Command in 2010 -- a post that gave him command responsibility for all US forces in the Middle East. \n\nHe also was an outspoken critic of the Iran nuclear deal. He also has served as a commander of a major NATO strategic command, Allied Command Transformation, in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nMattis butted heads with the Obama administration as head of US Central Command from 2010 to 2013 over the need to prepare for potential conflict with Iran.\n\nHe was a critic of the Iran nuclear deal and said at the Aspen Security Forum in 2013, when asked about his top concerns as head of US Central Command, \"Iran, Iran, Iran.\"\n\nWhy is Mattis called \"Mad Dog\"?\n\nMattis earned the nickname \"Mad Dog\" after leading combat troops into the Persian Gulf War in 1991, as well as Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s.\n\nHe was called \"Mad Dog\" after the 2004 battle of Fallujah in Iraq, where he led British and American troops against Iraqi insurgents. He has backed up the nickname with off-color remarks, such as his 2005 declaration in a panel discussion about the Taliban that \"it's fun to shoot people.\"\n\nHe is also a bachelor and an avid reader and student of military history, earning a second nickname: \"The Warrior Monk.\" \n\nThis story has been updated.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.25786161422729, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 582, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.2473765635400005, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161201220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.78006872852234, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/21/europe/berlin-christmas-market-truck/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [6742], "\u00e8": [2182]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 691, "scraper_regex": 1411}}, "headline": "Berlin attack: Police hunt Tunisian suspect after finding ID papers ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1411, "date": "20161221060000", "story_content": "A manhunt is underway for a 24-year-old Tunisia native in connection with this week's Christmas market attack in Berlin -- a man German authorities say may be \"violent and armed\" and had been in contact with radical Islamist groups.\n\nAnis Amri is being sought in Monday's truck attack, which left 12 people dead and 48 injured at Breitsheidplatz, a wanted notice issued Wednesday by the German federal prosecutor's office said. \n\nPolice have offered a reward of up to 100,000 euros (about $104,000) for information about his whereabouts, and said Amri is \"under urgent suspicion.\"\n\n\"If you see this person that we are seeking, inform the police. Please do not put yourself in danger because this person could be violent and armed!\" the notice said.\n\nLatest developments\n\n\u2022 Amri is 1.78 meters (5 feet 10 inches) tall and weighs about 75 kilograms (165 pounds).\n\n\u2022 The suspect was arrested in August with forged documents en route to Italy, but a judge released him, an official says.\n\n\u2022  Police at one point noticed the suspect because he was looking for a gun.\n\n\u2022  The suspect arrived in Germany in 2015 and was known to be in touch with radical Islamist groups, a state minister says.\n\n\u2022  The suspect's asylum request was refused this year and deportation was attempted, state minister says.\n\n\u2022  German police conduct raids in North Rhine-Westphalia region, a security official says.\n\nHunt for suspect\n\nAmri's identity papers were found inside the cabin of the truck used in Monday's attack, German security officials said. \n\nBefore Amri was publicly named, Ralf Jaeger, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, told reporters the suspect was known to German security services as someone in contact with radical Islamist groups, and had been assessed as posing a risk. \n\nOne German security official told CNN the suspect had been arrested in August with forged documents in the southern German town of Friedrichshafen, on his way to Italy, but a judge released him. The suspect also came onto the radar of German police because he was looking for a gun, the official said. \n\nInterior Minister Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re told reporters a manhunt had been underway across Europe since midnight.\n\nGerman police carried out raids Wednesday in connection with the investigation in North Rhine-Westphalia, where Amri had stayed, another security official told CNN. \n\nISIS claimed it had inspired Monday's attack. The terror group's affiliated Amaq News Agency described the perpetrator as a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" who had acted in response to calls for attacks in the West. \n\nAmri was named as a suspect a day after police released a different man. The first man, an asylum seeker believed to be from Pakistan, had been detained in the immediate aftermath of the attack, with German media reporting that witnesses had said he'd driven the truck.\n\nBut Peter Frank, general prosecutor at Germany's Federal Court of Justice, said that forensic tests offered no link between the man and the truck's cabin.\n\nLink to pro-ISIS network?\n\nJaeger said Amri was believed to have entered Germany in July 2015 and had traveled between Berlin, North Rhine-Westphalia and other cities. He was \"very mobile,\" but was mostly in Berlin since February, he said. \n\nAmri requested asylum in Germany, but this was refused in June, Jaeger said -- two months before his reported arrest in southern Germany. A deportation process was started in North Rhine-Westphalia, Jaeger said.\n\nThe suspect had been registered by German authorities as someone who posed a risk, said Stephan Mayer, a spokesman for the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union parliamentary group. Mayer said the suspect was believed to have links to a Salafist group, referring to an ultra-conservative branch of Islam.\n\nBut authorities' attempts to deport him were thwarted because they were unable to establish his identity beyond doubt, Mayer said. \n\nGerman security officials told CNN that investigators believe the Tunisian suspect is linked to a recruitment network for ISIS operating in Germany.\n\nThe main figure in the network, Ahmad Abdulaziz Abdullah -- a 32-year-old Iraqi national also known as Abu Walaa -- and four others were arrested and charged with terrorism offenses in November. \n\nGerman federal prosecutors said then that Abdullah was the ringleader of a multiregional recruitment network. The group allegedly targeted and radicalized young Muslims in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony.\n\nJaeger said he could not confirm a link to Abu Walaa.\n\nTunisian radio network Mosaique FM interviewed a man who identified himself as Amri's father. The man said Anis is one of four children, and that he and Amri's mother are divorced. \n\nAmri left Tunisia for Italy about seven years ago, after he dropped out of school, the man said. The man said he hasn't heard from Amri but that Amri maintained contact with his siblings through phone calls that sometimes came months apart. \n\nOriginal truck driver slain\n\nA Polish man found shot dead inside the truck has been identified as its original driver, according to German media. He was not driving during the incident, police said. The gun used to kill him has not been recovered. \n\nThe slain driver may have been involved in a struggle with the suspect inside the truck's cabin before he was shot, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. This could be when the suspect's identity papers were dropped, he suggested.\n\nThe truck, which was owned by a Polish company, was hauling 25 tons of steel before it was steered into the crowd, according to its owner, Ariel Zurawski. He identified the slain driver as his cousin. \n\nPolice have appealed to the public for any digital videos and photos they have of the attack or possible suspects. \n\n'Like a little war zone' \n\nGerman authorities have not publicly named any of the victims, and police have asked people not to post videos or photos of them as a sign of respect.\n\nBut Israel's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that a 60-year-old Israeli woman -- Dalia Elaykim -- had died in the attack. Her husband was seriously injured. The embassy is working with the family to bring her body back to Israel for burial, the Ministry said.\n\nItaly's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Italian national Fabrizia Di Lorenzo was missing following the attack and that her family was now in Berlin. The ministry said it was waiting for German investigators to complete their work before issuing a statement.\n\nItaly's ANSA news agency reported the missing woman, 31, worked in Berlin and that her cell phone was found at the attack scene.\n\nMichael Schuetz, the doctor who oversaw the emergency response at Berlin's Charit\u00e9 hospital, told CNN that survivors described a scene \"like a little war zone.\"\n\nPhysical injuries ranged from major trauma for those hit by the truck to lesser injuries suffered when poles from the market huts fell on people, he said.\n\nDueling protests\n\nBerliners who came to leave flowers and candles at makeshift shrines near the Christmas market told CNN Wednesday they would not allow the attack to change the way they led their lives.\n\nOne handwritten note left with a bunch of roses read, \"You will not have our hate,\" echoing the words of writer Antoine Leiris after he lost his wife in the Paris attacks.\n\nWednesday night, the issue of migrants drew dueling protests outside the Berlin Zoo rail station. On one side a few dozen people joined a demonstration by the far-right, ultranationalist National Democratic Party, waving German flags and railing against the acceptance of migrants and refugees.\n\nThey were countered by a group of several hundred people, many of whom shouted: \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here!\"\n\nSome in the counterdemonstration carried white signs with red hearts printed on them. Signs carried messages such as \"Solidarity instead of hate,\" and \"Together against Nazis.\"\n\nAs the NPD side delivered speeches on a loudspeaker, the counterdemonstrators drowned them out with music, chants and whistles.\n\nAmong the pro-refugee crowd was 70-year-old Irmela Schramm, who for years has sought out neo-Nazi graffiti across Germany and painted over it with heart shapes. \n\n\"When I saw what happened on Monday, I knew I would have a lot more to do,\" she said Wednesday.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has come under political pressure over her government's generous acceptance of refugees. Germany has taken in more than 890,000 asylum-seekers in the past year, a much higher number than other European nations.\n\nHow populism could shake up Europe: A visual guide\n\n The issue contributed to defeats for Merkel's Christian Democratic Union in Berlin and her home state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern during regional elections this year.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.55801105499268, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 691, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 18, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.9175012131999996, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.77568740955137, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/14/opinions/what-tech-ceos-should-tell-trump-alaimo/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "How tech CEOs can lay down the law for Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1030, "date": "20161214180000", "story_content": "In a widely shared article this week, Recode's Kara Swisher argued that the tech CEOs who were to meet with Donald Trump Wednesday -- including Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Alphabet's Larry Page and Microsoft's Satya Nadella -- \"should be ashamed of themselves for lining up like sheeple\" after the president summoned them. \n\nShe's wrong.  \n\nTrue, tech CEOs have a right to be angry.

Facebook should partner with the Pulitzer prize-winning website Politifact to begin fact-checking all statements that Trump, his cabinet secretaries, and his top White House aides post on the platform. \n\nThis is particularly necessary because, according to Politifact, just 14% of Trump's statements to date have been true. The American people won't be able to participate in our democracy if we don't know the truth about what's going on.\n\nAs Founding Father James Madison explained, the \"right of freely examining public characters and measures, and of free communication among the people thereon ... has ever been justly deemed the only effectual guardian of every other right.\" \n\nSo anytime senior Trump administration officials post on Facebook, Politifact's team -- fortified with new funding from the social network -- would get to work. As soon as they reached a verdict on where a statement falls on Politifact's scorecard -- true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, false, or \"pants on fire\" -- they would post an icon next to the Facebook post, along with a link to a longer explanation. \n\nIdeally, Sandberg would be in a position to notify Trump of such a new initiative Wednesday. Better still, she'd be able to notify Trump on behalf of Twitter -- whose CEO was strangely, and notably, not invited to today's meeting -- that they would be doing the same.\n\n2.  The CEOs publicly pledge that they'll never voluntarily share user data with him and they'll never build, or hire anyone who works on, a registry of Muslims or illegal immigrants. \n\nTrump transition adviser Peter Thiel, who helped convene Wednesday's meeting, is co-founder of Palantir, the big data company that already has a contract for a database that could help the Trump administration crack down on these groups. Thiel's closeness to Trump has led to fears that he'll expand such deals.\n\nMany tech engineers have already signed a pledge to never work on a Muslim registry. But for those on the fence, knowing that doing so will foreclose future employment opportunities at some of Silicon Valley's most attractive employers would likely make the decision to decline easy, starving Palantir of top talent for such assignments.\n\nCook must also reiterate that Apple won't help federal law enforcement officials crack encrypted communications. Those requests could well be used to target critics of Trump, who has a history of lashing out at his detractors.\n\n3. Google's Page and Microsoft's Nadella must plan to implement new security measures to protect individual email accounts \u2014 and put Trump on notice about such a plan. This is necessary because Russia hacked the Gmail account of Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, Democratic and Republican National Committee email servers, and email addresses linked to the Republican National Committee. More recently, a foreign government has been attacking the Google accounts of liberal journalists and professors, including me.\n\nThere is no evidence that Trump had any involvement in the attacks -- though he did publicly call on the Kremlin to hack Clinton's email address. But he certainly benefited from them, because the hackers released only the emails of Democrats.\n\nTech CEOs must let Trump -- who has already said he plans to be president for eight years -- know that he won't be able to count on such help when he runs for re-election.\n\n4. Facebook should plan to block fake news sites altogether, and announce this to Trump. \n\nCraig Silverman of Buzzfeed found that the influence of fake news was so great in the election that, by the end of the campaign, the 20 fake news stories that received the greatest engagement -- measured in shares, reactions and comments -- outperformed the 20 biggest legitimate news stories. Seventeen of the 20 fake stories favored Trump, such as those claiming he was endorsed by the pope and the one headlined, \"FBI agent suspected in Hillary email leaks found dead in apartment in murder-suicide.\" \n\nTrump must know that henceforth social media users will judge him based on facts.\n\n5. Finally, Sandberg's job will be done only after she warns Trump that Facebook's Community Standards will ban hate speech, which includes content that \"directly attacks\" people because of their religion, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation or other characteristics. \n\nThis is necessary because, during the course of the presidential campaign, Trump called for a national ban on Muslims, called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and mocked a journalist who had a disability. His supporters have regularly sought to amplify his remarks on social media.\n\nSandberg should inform Trump that, according to the social network's rules, \"organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook,\" and that Trump and his supporters will be in danger of having their accounts shut down if they engage in such attacks on social media.\n\nSandberg should also tell Trump that she won't allow him to single out ordinary Americans for attack on Facebook -- like the 18-year-old college student he bullied on Twitter who later received rape and death threats. \n\nBecause such cyber threats are almost always leveled by men against women, University of Maryland law professor Danielle Citron says they can be considered hate crimes. While it's fine for Trump to fight about issues or argue with people who have actively chosen public life, Sandberg must let him know that his future attempts to cybershame individual citizens will be deleted.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.25303292274475, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1062, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.57129738613, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161214180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.5423728813559303, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/02/opinions/trump-north-korea-priority-opinion/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 915, "scraper_regex": 987}}, "headline": "Why Donald Trump should make North Korea a top priority", "wordcount_as_scraped": 987, "date": "20170102190000", "story_content": "The Obama administration's failed policy of \"strategic patience\" toward Pyongyang contributed to the rapid development of North Korea's arsenal of mass destruction. The acceleration of its nuclear and ballistic missile program represents a grave threat to global peace and stability -- and a direct threat to the American homeland in the immediate future.\n\nIn short, turning a blind eye to North Korea produced one of the greatest and most complex security challenges facing the incoming Trump administration. Therefore, it is imperative that the next administration not only ratchet up pressure on the regime, but that it work with Congress, the international community and our allies in the region to counter North Korean aggression.\n\nNorth Korea's spike in weapons tests is evidence that its capabilities are increasing and that its murderous leader, Kim Jong Un, grows increasingly belligerent and provocative. \n\nThe Institute for Science and International Security has estimated that North Korea may currently have as many as 20 nuclear warheads, while the Rand corporation believes that North Korea has the potential to possess as many as 100 warheads within the next five years. Recently, the regime conducted its fifth and largest nuclear test with an estimated explosive yield of 10 kilotons of TNT in September 2016, marking its second test of the year and fourth test since 2009. \n\nNorth Korea's cyber attacks have also grown in number and sophistication. According to a recent report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies: \"North Korea is emerging as a significant actor in cyberspace with both its military and clandestine organizations gaining the ability to conduct cyber operations.\" In addition to the widely-reported hack of Sony Pictures in 2014, the North Koreans have successfully breached South Korean civilian and military institutions, including reportedly obtaining blueprints for components of the US-made F-15 fighter jet.   \n\nNorth Korea's malicious activities extend beyond its weapons program and cyber attacks; North Korea is one of the world's foremost abusers of human rights. According to a 2013 Amnesty international report, the regime was holding as many as 200,000 men, women, and children in political prison camps, where they are subjected to what the UN has described as \"unspeakable atrocities\". \n\nAfter years of inaction, Congress addressed Kim Jong Un's belligerent behavior by passing the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act in February of 2016, marking the first time Congress imposed stand-alone mandatory sanctions on North Korea. President Obama signed the legislation into law just days later, a recognition that his policy of \"strategic patience\" was unsuccessful and it is time for a new approach to deterring Pyongyang. This legislation was also the first to mandate cyber sanctions against North Korea, however, the Obama administration has not done so to date.\n\nWhile the Obama administration has implemented portions of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, I encourage the Trump administration to continue with the full implementation and more importantly, the enforcement of the sanctions outlined in the legislation. \n\nIn particular, I urge the new administration to utilize the so-called \"secondary sanctions,\" which target outside entities, or companies, that help Pyongyang engage in illicit behavior. Many of these companies are based in the People's Republic of China, and the US must not be afraid to anger Beijing by going after them. While the Obama administration has sanctioned and indicted four Chinese nationals and one Chinese-based company for its business tied to North Korea's weapons program, there are many more that the Treasury Department can -- and should -- target with financial sanctions.\n\nDue to the lack of real enforcement mechanisms, it is impossible to know whether China -- North Korea's largest trading partner -- has faithfully complied with UN Security Council Resolutions relating to North Korea, and the United States has done little to address it. That is why I urge the Trump administration to immediately pursue and implement a full range of economic and criminal unilateral sanctions on any entity that violates North Korea sanctions. Our message must be clear: if you do business with Pyongyang, you will face the full wrath of the US economic sanctions regime.\n\nWhile sanctions are an important tool to deter Pyongyang, it is also essential that the US reassure our allies, South Korea and Japan, through action that any aggression from North Korea will result in unwavering diplomatic and military support from the United States. The US should continue with show of force exercises near North Korea to demonstrate to the regime that it will pay a heavy price for any aggression to our allies in the region, such as the B-1 nuclear bomber overflights in September.\n\nAdditionally, we must expedite the placement of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, in South Korea to protect our allies and the tens of thousands of American troops in the region. I also urge the Trump administration to explore possibilities for asymmetrical actions to increase pressure on the regime, such as the re-designation of North Korea as a state sponsor of terror, stripping Pyongyang of its United Nations seat, or imposing a genuine and enforceable global trade embargo on Pyongyang.\n\nIn order to effectively counter the North Korean threat, the US must strengthen its alliances in the region and build a genuine and lasting trilateral alliance between the US, the Republic of Korea, and Japan. The recent trilateral missile defense exercises and the signing of an intelligence information-sharing agreement between Seoul and Tokyo have been historic developments and we must continue to build on this progress. \n\nWhile US policy toward North Korea has been enhanced with the new sanctions legislation, we still have not peacefully disarmed Pyongyang -- and that should be the primary and unwavering US policy goal. Through a policy of strength, the incoming Trump administration should seize the immediate opportunity to communicate with action to Kim Jong Un as well as our allies that the United States remains committed to standing up to tyrants and ensuring peace and stability around the globe.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.3776867389678995, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 915, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.93736262207, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170102190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.51366120218579, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/19/americas/el-chapo-guzman-brooklyn-detention/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [9908], "\u00e1": [11100], "\u00fa": [10015]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1722, "scraper_regex": 1934}}, "headline": "El Chapo's next stop?

It's how the segregated prisoners commiserate about life behind bars. They pound the walls until their fists are bloody. They clog toilets and flood their cells, urine and feces pouring into the corridors.\n\nSuch is life in the most restricted units of the nine-story Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn. \n\nIt's also the largest federal detention center, with inmates deemed \"extremely dangerous, violent, or escape-prone,\" according to the US Justice Department. \n\nMDC could be the new home of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, the reputed drug kingpin who was extradited from his native Mexico and transported to the United States on Thursday.\n\nGuzman was picked up by members of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Marshals. He was flown Thursday evening to New York.  \n\nA master of escape, \"El Chapo\" pleaded not guilty to 17 drug-related charges Friday in a federal court in Brooklyn, where he is to stand trial at a later date.\n\n\"As you looked into his eyes you can see the surprise, you can see the shock, and to a certain extent you can actually see the fear as the realization started to kick in that he's about to face American justice,\" Angel Melendez, special agent in charge for Homeland Security Investigations, New York, said after Guzman arrived in the city. \n\nMelendez added that \"no tunnel will be built leading to his bathroom, a reference to Guzman's most recent escape from a Mexican prison.\n\nCourt documents as well as interviews with former federal prison officials, penal experts and others shed light on the conditions he could expect across the shallow waters of the Rio Grande.  \n\nOnce those metal doors close, 'it's pretty much over'  \n\nLife in America will be starkly different from Guzman's time at the maximum security Puente Grande prison near Guadalajara, Mexico, where he lived in relative luxury until he decided to break out in 2001 -- by some accounts, in a laundry cart.    \n\nNor will it resemble his days at the Supermax-like Altiplano prison near Mexico City, where he slipped out through an elaborate underground tunnel and rode a motorcycle to freedom.      \n\n\"He's definitely not going to be digging any tunnels in Brooklyn,\" former MDC prisoner Esteban Gonzalez told CNN in August. \"I can tell you that. Once those metal doors close behind him, it's pretty much over.\" \n\nGuzman's alleged bribes once assured him country club-style confinement back home.  \n\nBut life will be different in Brooklyn, where Guzman and other cartel leaders were indicted in 2009 on charges of conspiring to import more than 264,000 pounds of cocaine into the United States between 1990 and 2005, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nThe indictment also accuses the alleged traffickers of sharing transportation routes and obtaining drugs from various Colombian cartels.\n\nIn addition, Guzman faces charges in Arizona, California, Texas, Illinois, Florida and New Hampshire. \n\n\"El Chapo's basically going to be locked down ... in his cell 23 hours a day,\" Robert Hood, a former Federal Bureau of Prisons warden, said in an interview. \n\nA criminal world who's who\n\nAt MDC, the architect of the largest illegal narcotics operation in the world will be one of about 1,800 prisoners slogging through the federal court system. \n\nUpon arrival, the diminutive crime boss -- whose nickname is \"Shorty\" -- will receive a number that will identify him during his time in US government custody.\n\nThe lockup houses New York's most violent federal prisoners, including mob bosses, drug traffickers and terrorists.\n\nIn fact, former prisoner Gonzalez name drops underworld figures like celebrity sightings.\n\nThey included Ramzi Yousef, who plotted the 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center; Bonanno boss Joseph Massino; reputed former Gambino mobster John \"Junior\" Gotti and uncle Peter Gotti; the late Genovese crime boss Vincent \"The Chin\" Gigante;  and mafia turncoat \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano.\n\n\"You look through the narrow pane of glass on cell door and see who's coming and going,\" Gonzalez said. \"You can tell who they are from the newspapers or the guards call out their names.\"  \n\nInmates like Guzman are typically held in special housing units, where they are separated from the general population. The units are for inmates who are disruptive, pose a security risk or need protection as witnesses, according to the justice department.\n\nPower and notoriety can be commodities in prison\n\nIt will be critical to keep Guzman isolated, according to Hood. \n\nThe worst of the worst are confined in administrative maximum special housing, which have stricter restraint policies, hand-held cameras to record detainee movements and cell cameras. The so-called admax units were created in New York after a former aide to the late Osama bin Laden in 2000 stabbed a federal corrections officer in the eye with a comb sharpened into a shank. \n\n\"He's going to be different than the terrorists and typical spies and gang leaders only because he does have the charisma,\" Hood said. \"He does have the money connections in the United States. You want to cut the head off the snake quickly and separate him.\"\n\nPower and notoriety can be commodities behind bars. \n\n\"El Chapo is definitely going to have respect,\" said Gonzalez, who did 18.5 years in the federal system for firearms possession and a prison assault. \n\n\"People are not going to want to mess with him because they know he has connections and the means to get some things done. He can pay other prisoners to get violent on somebody,\" he added.  \n\nStill, Guzman, whose net worth was once estimated at $1 billion by Forbes magazine, doesn't have to resort to violence.\n\n\"He will also try to persuade you by making you rich,\" said Jim Dinkins, retired head of investigations for the US Department of Homeland Security.  \n\n'El Chapo is next door'\n\nLife in isolation can be maddening. \n\nPrisoners interminably wail, scream and pound the walls, according to Gonzalez, who spent nearly three years in special housing at MDC and another federal facility in Manhattan.\n\nThey spread feces, other human waste and body fluids throughout their cells or hurl it at officers. They mutilate their bodies with razors or writing utensils. \n\n\"Some inmates are so miserable that when they hear El Chapo is next door, they'll start screaming and banging on the wall to harass him because he's famous,\" Gonzalez said.  \n\n\"They taunt and scream at you. They're stressed out. They'll start an argument just to have a conversation. Nobody talks to them. They say disrespectful things about your mother.\"\n\nThe 7-by-12-foot cells have bunk beds with meager mattresses, a toilet and sink, a shower and a small metal seating area.\n\n\"It will be very, very lonely for El Chapo,\" said Arnett Gaston, former commanding officer of New York's Rikers Island jail complex and a consultant to the federal prisons bureau. \"He won't have cellmates to talk to.\"\n\nAn hour of recreation a day takes place on a rooftop area enclosed by a chain link fence on all sides and overhead. \n\n\"That's where you get your fresh air, and the sunlight comes in,\" Gonzalez said. \"You can't see sky from your cell.\"\n\nBreakfast is served at 6 a.m., lunch at 11 a.m., and dinner after the 4 p.m. inmate count, according to the MDC's admission and orientation manual. \n\n\"The stuff being sent to special housing basically is the last of what they cooked that day,\" Gonzalez said. \"If the general population was served chicken with a bone, they won't send us that. They don't want inmates in special housing to sharpen bones into weapons.\"\n\n'Brooklyn's Abu Ghraib'\n\nThe MDC has gained notoriety over the years.  \n\nA New York appeals court last year revived a federal civil rights lawsuit claiming that Muslim, South Asian and Arab immigrants were subjected to beatings, strip searches and other abuses in the months after the 9-11 terror attacks.   \n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the nonprofit Center for Constitutional Rights, named as defendants former MDC and high-level Bush administration officials.  \n\nThe allegations earned the lockup the nickname \"Brooklyn's Abu Ghraib,\" a reference to the scandal-plagued Iraqi prison used as an Army detention center in the early 2000s.\n\nA 2003 Justice Department investigation found that prison guards slammed detainees into walls, twisted their arms and wrists, lifted restrained prisoners by their arms, and subjected them to humiliating strip searches. The men were being held on immigration violations. \n\nIn 2015, an appeals court revived a separate civil rights suit in which Gonzalez accused the MDC and a former warden of a racially motivated vendetta for holding him in isolation for more than two years. The lawsuit alleges the Federal Bureau of Prisons ordered the ex-warden to remove a Confederate flag on display in his office at the MDC. \n\nThe prisons bureau has declined comment about the pending litigation or preparations for receiving Guzman. The former warden named in the two civil rights lawsuits did not return repeated requests for comment. \n\nEl Chapo's resort\n\nGuzman lived like a king at Mexico's Puente Grande lockup, with catered food and frequent visits from women, according to Anabel Hernandez, an investigative journalist who writes about Mexico's cartels. \n\n\"This prison became a resort for El Chapo Guzman,\" Hernandez said. Food and liquor were delivered regularly from the finest restaurants in Guadalajara.  \n\nGuzman had been in federal custody since June 9, 1993, after being captured in Guatemala, near the Mexican border, on drug trafficking, murder and kidnapping charges.\n\nA notorious ladies man, Guzman was known to keep an ample supply of Viagra in prison, Hernandez said. Guzman had conjugal visits as well as many trysts with prostitutes, female prison workers and inmates. \n\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Ortega, who in 2000 deposed Guzman in connection with the murder of Guadalajara Cardinal Juan Jes\u00fas Posadas Ocampo, said the drug trafficker acted like he \"owned the prison.\"\n\nOrtega's scheduled meeting with Guzman was delayed 12 hours. \n\n\"Look, I had my conjugal visit today,\" Ortega remembered Guzman telling him. \"Afterward, I went to the steam room and then had to take a nap so that I could greet you as you deserve.\"\n\nTwo custodians accompanying Guzman acted like personal assistants. At his command, they fetched coffee and soft drinks.     \n\n\"It was as if he had invited us to his house,\" Ortega said. \n\nHow he escaped -- twice\n\nDespite the comfort, Guzman cut short his 20-year sentence by escaping in a laundry cart on Jan. 19, 2001. \n\nThe breakout, however, may have been easier than that.\n\n\"Sir, you can leave now,\" high-level Mexican officials told Guzman after opening the prison doors, according to Hernandez.\n\nGuzman would fork over tens of thousands of dollars a month to inmates, guards and prison officials, according to investigative journalist and author Jose Reveles. \n\nThe cartel leader was captured on February 24, 2014, in the Mexican beach resort of Mazatl\u00e1n. \n\nHe then escaped again in July 2015 using a mile-long tunnel fitted with a lighting and ventilation system as well as a modified motorcycle that ran on tracks. Seven workers at the maximum-security Altiplano prison were charged in connection with his escape.\n\n\"The system is very vulnerable to corruption and intimidation, which are basically his tools,\" said Alejandro Hope, a former intelligence analyst in Mexico. \"The tunnel could not have been built if he had not had complicity from within the prison.\"\n\nIn January 2016, Guzman was recaptured during a raid in the coastal city of Los Mochis in Sinaloa state. He was transferred five months later to a prison in Juarez, Mexico, just across the border from El Paso. \n\nMexican authorities had planned to turn over Guzman before Friday's inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, a US official told CNN.

The President put a bug in the ear of business executives, warning in a meeting they would face huge tariffs if they send manufacturing abroad. And he huddled with union leaders, promising a torrent of new jobs and factories.\n\nTuesday, the President will meet with the heads of the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler.\n\n\"We are going to put a lot of people back to work. We are going to use common sense and we are going to do it the way it is supposed to be done,\" Trump said Monday.\n\nTrump's moves also reversed the bipartisan orthodoxy advanced by successive presidents that has viewed US interests as best served by spreading American-style trade across the globe through large multilateral trade agreements. From now on, Trump said, the US will seek bilateral deals that will most of all benefit Americans and be quickly terminated if US partners cheat.\n\nHis action quickly scrambled political lines in Washington, as he set himself against large sections of his own Republican Party and consolidated his position on economic territory long occupied by Democrats.\n\nTrump's vow to kill or renegotiate multilateral trade deals was an important factor in his narrow November election victories in industrialized states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which upended the political map based on the votes of many workers -- including Democrats -- who feel left behind by economic globalization.\n\nMonday's moves offered a first glimpse of the \"America First\" principle that the President said in his inaugural address on Friday would now undergird every decision on foreign, economic and trade policy.\n\nTrump's spokesman Sean Spicer said that Trump was deeply preoccupied with the lives of people who helped him win last November.\n\n\"I think that's where his head's at, is trying to look at those people that come to his rallies, that have come to his events, that he's met with in person that are struggling and say 'Mr. Trump, I'm working as hard as I can. I'm working two jobs, I'm doing everything by the rules, and I keep getting screwed.'\"\n\n\"That's what he's fighting for,\" Spicer said.\n\nDemocrats on notice\n\nTrump's success in transcending party lines -- at least for now -- was evident in an approving statement about his TPP move from the AFL-CIO, the powerhouse union that endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for President last year.\n\n\"Today's announcement that the US is withdrawing from TPP and seeking a reopening of NAFTA is an important first step toward a trade policy that works for working people,\" said AFL-CIO President Rich Trumka.\n\nIn a political sense, Trump's busy first weekday in office also put Democrats on the back foot. He used the power and visibility of the presidency to impress his midwestern base of union and blue-collar voters -- even as the demoralized party of ex-President Barack Obama struggles to settle on a message to win them back.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer had only a terse response to Trump's move to pull out of the TPP, a deal the Obama administration spent years trying to negotiate but was unable to get ratified by Congress.\n\n\"TPP was dead long before President Trump took office. We await real action on trade,\" said Schumer in a statement.\n\nFast start\n\nThe White House understands it needs a fast start since Trump entered office with the lowest approval ratings for a newly inaugurated president in modern times.\n\nIts answer was a swift display of executive power to generate a sense of momentum for his new administration as  forthcoming attempts to create jobs through legislation, such as an infrastructure package that many Republicans oppose, could take months.\n\n\"I am very encouraged by the degree to which they are going to use executive orders to ... dramatically change things very rapidly,\" said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, at a Heritage Foundation lecture.\n\nTime and again Monday, reporters were herded into the Oval Office and the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing to see Trump in action, signing executive orders or laying down the law to union leaders or business leaders from blue chip companies like Dell, Ford, Johnson & Johnson and Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe image of the new President as a man of action was a sign that after a rocky first weekend, which included massive protests nationwide, his off-key speech at the CIA and a new media feud centering around the crowd size at Friday's inauguration, that the new White House was finding its feet and able to drive a coordinated political message.\n\nDangerous strategy\n\nBut it's one thing to maintain a solid public relations strategy. It's another to pull off the ambitious reorganizing of US trade and commerce that Trump is proposing. So Monday represented only a small first step.\n\nThe President's belief that trade pacts are responsible for the flight of many US jobs overseas represents a political risk, since higher tariffs and trade disputes that may result could make foreign goods more expensive for consumers or slow economic growth. \n\nDisrupting NAFTA may also be dangerous: Trade between the US, Canada and Mexico hit $1.1 trillion in 2016, according to a Wharton Business School report. Supporters of the pact say it supports millions of jobs in the United States that could be at risk if it falters.\n\nTrump's decision to reopen NAFTA therefore represents another significant gamble. For all his claims to being one of the world's great deal makers, the leaders of Canada and Mexico will be under intense political pressure to seal a better deal for their own people in new NAFTA negotiations -- and are unlikely to simply roll over and allow Trump to win all the spoils.\n\nMexico's President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto put Trump on notice Monday for tough negotiations, saying \"the Mexican president wants \"bilateral relationship with US to translate into more trade and jobs.\"\n\nWhile Democrats risked being outmaneuvered by Trump on the trade issue -- which played a powerful role in shaping the party's presidential primary, there remain plenty of other areas of contention that suggest the President's honeymoon with unions could be short-lived.\n\nThe President's labor secretary nominee, Andrew Puzder, for instance opposes calls for a rise in the minimum wage -- an issue that glues Democrats to trade union voters. His administration's business-first mantra could involve efforts to weaken labor protections. And if as expected, Trump chooses a conservative Supreme Court justice, he could rebalance the court in a way that could be damaging to union rights.\n\nTrump critics point out that photo-ops and episodes like his claim to have saved jobs at air conditioner firm Carrier during his presidential transition, represent a minuscule step toward creating millions of jobs. And Democrats also Monday accused Trump of hypocrisy for lecturing US corporate bosses on the need to keep manufacturing on US soil.\n\n\"I'd remind the President of the two simple rules he laid out in his inaugural address -- \"Buy American and Hire American\" -- two rules that his current businesses do not follow,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n\n\"Trump shirts and ties are made in China. Trump furniture is made in Turkey. While he's importuning on others to \"make it in America,\" he should start by demanding it of his own business.\"\n\nTPP fallout\n\nThere are also geopolitical implications from Trump's decision to pull out of the TPP that could haunt the administration in future. The US withdrawal will certainly benefit an emboldened China and the new administration already appears on collision course with the rising Asian power.\n\nUS allies like Singapore meanwhile have repeatedly warned US credibility in Asia would be seriously damaged if Washington pulled out of the TPP.\n\nThe case against Trump's action was spelled out by Republican Sen. John McCain, who is emerging as a fierce critic of the new administration's foreign policy. \n\n\"This decision will forfeit the opportunity to promote American exports, reduce trade barriers, open new markets, and protect American invention and innovation,\" McCain said in a statement.\n\n\"It will create an opening for China to rewrite the economic rules of the road at the expense of American workers. And it will send a troubling signal of American disengagement in the Asia-Pacific region at a time we can least afford it.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.610583424568176, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1377, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.7059774665700003, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.10602759622367, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/21/opinions/women-rallying-cry-rowe-finkbeiner-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Women, this is our rallying cry ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1023, "date": "20170121190000", "story_content": "The Women's March on Washington started as a trickle, then turned into a wave and then grew into a tsunami. Here's where it started: On Election Night, thousands of Hillary Clinton supporters at the Javits Center in New York stood cheering, buoyed by the polls, even before the final vote tallies came in. \n\nSilence crept through the massive room as the vote returns finally appeared on jumbotrons on the walls. People pulled up calculator apps on their phones to see if somehow, some way the states could add up to victory. When the calculations came back, they stood looking at the intact glass ceiling above like it betrayed them, waiting for a crack, an explanation. But that didn't happen. I was there with my daughter waiting, too. You could hear a pin drop.\n\nIt was a runaway, unexpected, complete Electoral College victory by Donald Trump, a man with a history of brushing off saying things such as \"grab them by the pussy\" about women. Meanwhile, Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. But while the glass ceiling didn't shatter that night, something else cracked open. As Leonard Cohen wrote, \"There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in.\" \n\nThe idea of the march was born on Facebook in the aftermath of Clinton's loss, and it is now bringing women together across our nation through more than 600 local \"sister\" marches and one massive march in Washington that could exceed the attendance of the Trump inauguration. To be clear, the Electoral College win was nowhere near a mandate. Losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, as Trump did, means there is no basis on which to claim a mandate. The election, though, did serve as a wake-up call for many on a number of levels:\n\n1. Every vote matters. Our recent election had the lowest voter turnout in 20 years.\n\n2. Take nothing, no right for granted. The civil rights page on the White House disappeared the moment our new President took office.\n\n3. Stay close to your friends to organize, knit change and hold elected officials accountable. That \"grab them by the pussy\" statement by Trump? He's now being held accountable. Hundreds of thousands of women are now knitting, wearing and sharing #PussyHats as they march. \n\nHere's what some of the many MomsRising members who are attending have to say about why they are marching: \n\n\"As a Latina, public school teacher, head of household and social advocate I must be part of the resistance. We will make our voices heard! We will make changes for us and future generations.\" -- Andrea from Florida\n\n\"Three generations from our family will be marching -- this is a historical moment. Never has it seemed so imperative to speak out and be counted. No longer willing to be part of a silent majority!\" -- Linda from Washington\n\n\"A bunch of my neighbors and friends are going. My family made some Trump puppets. We plan to bring the puppets and carry signs that say 'Not My Puppet.' Some of us are marching to keep the (Affordable Care Act) in place. For me, it was the Trump tweets against John Lewis. He went way too far. I am outraged. Which line will he cross next?\" -- Anne from California\n\n\"As a 69-year-old black woman I must march to preserve the benefits we received from marching and protesting for civil rights. I have daughters and a granddaughter who need the opportunities that the incoming administration and their state and local cronies are vowing to destroy. I will take my medications, dress appropriately and join other women and our supporters to show the world that we will not sit quietly and let others control our voices, our bodies and our futures.\" -- Sheila from Virginia\n\n\"At the Women's March on Washington, I'll be a mom rising in several ways: I'm attending with my daughter, and she's pregnant with the next generation.\" -- Nancy from Wisconsin\n\n\"With the enthusiasm of a grandmother (I am 73) and a granddaughter (Maggie is 12) to share an adventure, we will board a bus in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Friday morning, attempt to sleep along the way, arrive in DC and march. Then we will re-board the bus and repeat the attempts to sleep, to return to Minnesota on Sunday afternoon. We march for those in our family tree who could not vote, we march for the protection of young women, which my granddaughter will be sooner than later; we march for the poor and the powerless, the voiceless and the voter! Thank you for asking for our story.\" -- Barbara from Minnesota\n\n\"My autistic son and I will virtually march in solidarity, because, 'Until all are free, none are free!' (MLK Jr.) #WhyIMarch\" -- Jessica from Tennessee\n\n\"We will be marching in Fairbanks, Alaska, despite 40 below temperatures because we care. We care about human rights, we care about women's rights, we care about LGBT rights, we care about health care as a human right, we care about our environment and how we leave the planet for our grandchildren, we care about Social Security, we care about justice for all, we care about black lives, we care about immigrants, we care about refugees.  We care!\" -- Kathy from Alaska\n\n\"I'm 62 years old and I've never protested anything before. However, I'll be joining my neighbors in Asheville, North Carolina, to make the point that our president does not have a mandate, rather his immaturity is scaring even people like me into action.\" -- Sherrie from North Carolina\n\nMy 101-year-old grandma fought for women's rights with the same fierce determination that led her to take driving lessons on her 95th birthday -- 18-wheeler truck driving lessons, wearing kitten heels. My great grandma and mom fought for women's rights, too. And my son and daughter are marching Saturday. Our nation is generations into this fight.  And we're absolutely not turning back now.\n\nThe march is a release valve, an avenue to be heard, a rallying cry. And people are answering each other's call, bringing voices together, many for the first time through friends telling friends until this historic march was born.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.0922509208321571, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 998, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.867687113860001, "HarmVirtue": 17, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 49, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170121190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.90981963927856, "mft_mean": 4.45454545455}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/02/middleeast/isis-toxic-legacy-black/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 690, "scraper_regex": 752}}, "headline": "ISIS' toxic legacy: Iraqis battle the blazing oil wells suffocating residents", "wordcount_as_scraped": 752, "date": "20161202130000", "story_content": "Menacing black smoke hangs over the town of al-Qayyara. The air here is poison.\n\nChildren with blackened hands and soot-stained faces play beneath the toxic plumes. The early afternoon sun is so eclipsed by the haze that day seems like endless twilight.\n\nThe dark filth coating the landscape and choking residents' lungs comes from oil wells sabotaged and set alight by ISIS in August.\n\nEngineers and firefighters have been battling the flames for 100 days now. When CNN first visited al-Qayyara back in early October, they had tackled six fires with nine to go. But the real extent of the damage had yet to be determined. \n\nNow there are 19 burning wells, three of which have been sealed. Turning them all off is expected to take months and cost millions of dollars in lost oil revenue.\n\nIt's suspected the terror group damaged the oil field to create a smoke screen as Iraqi forces battled to push them out of al-Qayyara, about 35 miles south of Mosul. It is a devastating example of the group's scorched earth policy.\n\n\"ISIS, these terrorists, did this,\" Itkhlaf Mohammed, a lead engineer working to cap the wells says. \"They did it to provide themselves with cover from airplanes and at the same time to ruin and take revenge on the area.\"\n\nISIS uses water as weapon in Mosul fight\n\nA colossal challenge\n\nFirefighters, engineers, and oil workers must battle unimaginable conditions to contain these fires and extinguish the blazing oil wells.\n\nThe heat is so high that it has melted much of the ground close to the wells. The air is thick and foul and tastes terrible. The smoke makes your eyes water.\n\nDozens of men work long days at these sites but few wear gas masks. Some wrap their faces with scarves.\n\nThe process of containing the fires and capping the wells can take anywhere between two days and two months depending on the extent of the damage caused by ISIS militants.\n\n\"This is a very complicated process. You can't just put out the fire with water,\" Mohammed says. \"You have to actually reach the head of the well and control it. And this is very difficult and also dangerous.\"\n\nFirst, earth-moving equipment is used to contain the fire and channel the oil flow away from people's homes.\n\nThen workers dig down through the flames, while trying to keep the oil and their equipment cool as they haul out mounds of smoking sludge and earth.\n\nCurbing the flames in spite of ISIS\n\nOnly when they find the head of the well can they determine the extent of the damage and what must be done to close it. Often experts must be lowered into the well to inspect and repair breaks while the fire still burns above ground.\n\nWells that have only been set alight can be turned off via a functioning valve. But if the well was blown up with explosives -- which is the case for most -- then fixing the break is far more challenging.\n\nPlugging the leak with cement is the option of last resort because it means the well can't be used in the future.\n\nAnd as oil field guards fight to stifle the flames, ISIS have continued to deliberately disrupt their work. Militants were still fighting Iraqi troops nearby when the repairs began and workers say they sometimes came under mortar fire. The group also left mines around the wells which have yet to be cleared.\n\n\"Right now we have the problem of the IEDs that were planted by ISIS,\" Mohammed explains. \"We have been working with a de-mining unit of the federal police to clear the area.\"\n\nSo far 120 IEDs, or improvised explosive devices, have been located around the burning wells. Officials say they expect to find dozens more. Despite the dangers, the small teams of men working to put out the poisonous fires remain resolute.\n\n\"We have to overcome all these difficulties and turn off the wells,\" Abdelqadr Soltan, one of the workers, says. \"This is our job and this our duty.\"\n\nHow ISIS targets Mosul's children\n\nLong-term repercussions\n\nAll while the 15,000 residents of al-Qayyara continue to live in an environment they know is damaging their health, potentially for years to come.\n\n\"Every day the hospitals are admitting tens of patients complaining of breathing problems,\" Salah al-Joubri, mayor of al-Qayyara says. \n\n\"Everything is black. People's clothes are black. Their homes are black. Even the livestock is black. People wash their clothes and 30 minutes later they are black again.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.01058197021484, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 690, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.27090836305, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.4637681159420297, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/11/opinions/troubling-relationship-russia-america-treisman/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00ef": [4890]}}, "headline": "Putin: Trump's most dangerous best friend", "wordcount_as_scraped": 920, "date": "20161211160000", "story_content": "In the 1962 political thriller \"The Manchurian Candidate,\" a hostile government uses covert measures and secret agents in an elaborate plot to get its favored candidate elected president of the United States. The scenario seemed fanciful even at the height of the Cold War. \n\nToday, the idea seems strangely topical. \n\nTo be clear, nobody has suggested that President-elect Donald Trump and his team are secretly working for Moscow. Law enforcement officials who investigated the campaign's Kremlin ties last summer said they found no conclusive evidence of a direct link between Trump and the Russian government. \n\nIndirect links are another story. Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, resigned last August after his work helping a Putin-connected billionaire buy Ukrainian television assets attracted scrutiny. According to Newsweek, \"American and European intelligence\" investigated another campaign adviser, Carter Page, who was allegedly channeling messages from the Kremlin\u2014a charge he denies.\n\nTrump's pick for national security adviser, Lt. General Michael Flynn, boasts of having made a high-level briefing to Russia's military intelligence staff (GRU). He was paid to be interviewed live at a gala dinner marking the 10th anniversary of RT, the television channel that is Russia's main international purveyor of propaganda.  \n\nRex Tillerson, the Exxon Mobil CEO reported to be Trump's favorite for Secretary of State, has no public diplomatic experience. But he does have an \"Order of Friendship\" medal awarded him by Vladimir Putin. Five years ago, he signed an energy deal with Russia that is expected to bring in $500 billion. \n\nTillerson told reporters in 2014 that he and colleagues had lobbied in Washington against the sanctions placed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine. Lifting those sanctions would mean a bonanza for his company. It would also give Putin a green light\u2014so many experts believe\u2014for potential further aggression against Russia's neighbors.  \n\nTrump's own business dealings in Russia remain a mystery, in part because he has refused to publish his tax returns. His son, Donald Trump, Jr., said to a reporter in 2008 that he'd made six work trips to the country in the preceding 18 months. \"We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia,\" he claimed, particularly into the group's holdings in Dubai and New York. \n\nThe same year, Trump made an unusually profitable real estate sale. Having bought and renovated a 17-bedroom mansion in Florida for $41 million, he was having trouble finding a buyer. His salvation came in the form of the Russian fertilizer tycoon Dmitry Rybolovlev, who paid $95 million for the beachfront estate.  \n\nRybolovlev was apparently not the last Russian to come to Trump's aid. According to the Washington Post, CIA officials have concluded that the release of hacked emails by individuals tied to the Kremlin last summer aimed not just to undermine faith in US elections but specifically to help Trump win. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump has stunned foreign policy experts\u2014both Democrats and Republicans\u2014with a series of pronouncements that echo or applaud Kremlin positions. He has said that Putin \"is doing a great job\" and has pledged to \"get along very well with\" him. Rather than Putin being behind the cyberattacks disrupting the US election, Trump has suggested the culprit may be \"some guy in his home in New Jersey.\" \n\nHe assured an interviewer that Putin would not \"go into Ukraine,\" only to be told that the Russians already had. He has said he'd \"take a look at\" recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea, and has cast doubt on whether he would assist NATO members if attacked. No act by Moscow could have done more to undermine confidence in the alliance. \n\nAll this is quite unprecedented. No previous incoming president has had such a dense and murky network of indirect ties to leading circles in a power hostile toward the US. Potential conflicts of interest need to be thoroughly examined during Senate confirmation hearings for Trump's cabinet appointees, and law enforcement must investigate suspicious leads whenever the evidence merits. \n\nStill, the greatest concern about Trump's relationship with Russia is not that he is being secretly influenced by the Kremlin. Two other issues are taking greater precedence. \n\nFirst, even if he wishes to bargain hard for US interests, Trump enters the contest with Putin at a disadvantage, having given away his strongest cards. He has already granted Putin's first goal\u2014to be brought out of isolation\u2014without asking anything in return, and has shown that he has little stomach to continue sanctions. On Syria, he has backed away from demanding Assad's ouster. \n\nBy making unrequited concessions and raising expectations of rapprochement, he has placed Putin in the driver's seat. The Russian leader will likely view him as na\u00efve and seek to exploit his inexperience, vanity and desire for quick results. The danger is that Trump will concede even more US interests in return for insignificant gestures. \n\nThe second danger arises from Trump's famed temperament. Putin, who has lately cultivated a reputation for unpredictability, may have finally found his match in this regard. With two leaders improvising recklessly, the risk of miscalculations rises. \n\nNot only are both leaders prone to gamble, each has surrounded himself with colleagues with a conspiratorial view of the world. Putin's intelligence service aides are known to exaggerate the influence of the CIA in world events. Trump's national security advisor designee, according to several news organizations, has used social media to push fake news stories. \n\nThe combination of inaccurate information and impulsive decision making is deeply troubling when found in a single leader. In two, it is downright dangerous.

That was just the way we played.\" \n\nLet's do it, the chaplain said, and she left to get people to help make a dying wish into reality.\n\nFamily and hospital staff hurried to put a wedding together. One of the hospital's chaplains took Lamas to the courthouse to acquire a marriage license. When they arrived, the judge waived the typical 72-hour waiting period, Lamas said. \n\nThe director of the critical care unit -- who never wears a coat and tie to work, but had that morning after going to see his daughter's Christmas program at school -- shed his suit and gave it to Raul to wear for the ceremony, she said. \n\nCooks in the hospital's cafeteria baked a wedding cake, and relatives ran out to get a dress for Lamas. \n\n\"It was a perfect fit,\" said Angie Paiz, Raul's aunt. \n\nAfter Hinojosa was admitted to a critical care unit in Amarillo, Texas, in late October, Lamas had spent every day at his side, balancing his needs with the needs of their children at home.\n\nHinojosa and Lamas had been together for 11 years. \"He was very respectful, very romantic and always wanted to give me the world,\" Lamas said. \"He knew how to put a smile on my face no matter the situation.\" \n\nThey have a son who is 9, and Lamas has three daughters from a previous marriage, but Hinojosa took them in as if they were his own. \n\n\"As a father figure he was very loving, very caring to my kids,\" Lamas said. \"He gave them the world and was there for them when times were tough.\"\n\n\"He was a good person. He was a giving person,\" Paiz told CNN. He worked hard to provide for his family, picking up odd jobs even after he got sick because he couldn't keep a steady one. \n\nHinojosa proposed in 2007, but he and Lamas had been waiting to marry.\n\n\"He was determined to give me the best fairytale wedding,\" Lamas said. \"He tried saving up, but within that time he ended up getting diagnosed with the leukemia.\" \n\nHospital bills stacked up, and it started to look as if their dreams would never be realized.\n\nBut within a couple of hours, thanks to the collective effort of family and the hospital staff, the wedding was ready. \n\nNursing staff lined up outside the hospital room, and Lamas was escorted down the makeshift aisle by her father. \n\n\"When I walked down the aisle and saw him in the suit, he just took my breath away,\" Lamas said. \"He was so handsome.

Chelsea Manning, who was convicted of committing one of the biggest and most embarrassing leaks of classified information in US history.\n\nThe move came with the hours fast running down on Obama's presidency and rocked the political, intelligence and military intelligence establishments in Washington. And it will now rest forever on the 44th President's legacy as one of the most controversial moments of his tenure, judging by the furious bipartisan reaction to his decision to free someone regarded by many in Washington as as a traitor.\n\nHis decision to announce the commutation on the eve of his final presidential news conference on Wednesday indicates he wanted to explain the reasons for his decision to the American people in person. That opportunity may go some way to ensuring that the move does not sow controversy at the start of his post-presidency, as Bill Clinton's controversial pardon for fugitive financier Marc Rich did in 2001.\n\nSenior officials told CNN that Obama decided to act because Manning had expressed remorse and responsibility for her actions, and she had already served six years of a long sentence.\n\nObama may also have been motivated by humanitarian considerations, given that Manning is a transgender woman facing decades in an all-male prison and has attempted suicide several times.\n\nHe may also have reasoned that with President-elect Donald Trump about to take office, the chances of Manning winning release for years to come were slim.\n\nObama pushes through controversial moves before Trump takes over\n\nThe President also came under intense pressure from LGBT groups that have been stalwart supporters throughout his political career to show eleventh hour compassion towards Manning.\n\nA source with knowledge of the White House's thinking told CNN's Gloria Borger that Obama's decision took into account the fact that Manning -- unlike fugitive leaker Edward Snowden -- had pleaded guilty in a court of law to her offenses. \n\nBut in many ways, the decision appeared to run counter to some of Obama's own instincts as president and the sensitivity of the political moment.\n\nTo begin with, Obama has cultivated a reputation as showing zero tolerance to leakers of classified secrets during his administration.\n\n\"We're a nation of laws, we don't make our own individual decision about how the laws operate,\" Obama told protestors who heckled him over the US government's treatment of Manning at a fundraiser in 2011.\n\nWikileaks declares 'victory'\n\nObama's disdain for WikiLeaks itself, which published hundreds of thousands of classified documents stolen by Manning, is well known even though it didn't prevent him, in the end, from showing mercy to Manning.\n\nThe whistle-blowing website run by Julian Assange published  hundreds of thousands of documents stolen by Manning, including battlefield logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and diplomatic cables that caused deep US embarrassment.\n\nNow, the organization is at the center of the storm over alleged Russian hacking of Democratic servers during the election, and Assange is being accused of directly subverting American democracy.\n\nObama had sent his then secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, around the world to apologize to US allies for embarrassingly frank disclosures by US diplomats on cables from American embassies to Washington published on the site.\n\nThen Clinton herself, in the eyes of many Democrats, was deprived of the presidency because of the stolen emails from her campaign that were blasted around the world by WikiLeaks during the election.\n\nMilitary officials are likely to be especially angry about the move, given the fact that they argued the Wikileaks cables and disclosures endangered US service members, diplomats and those who cooperated with them in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIt did not take long for WikiLeaks to declare victory over the commutation -- something that could further Obama's public discomfort.\n\n\"Victory,\" Wikileaks said in a series of tweets welcoming the move.\n\nSnowden, who is exiled in Russia and has also been linked to Wikileaks, also congratulated Manning, tweeting \"Thanks, Obama.\"\n\nLet it be said here in earnest, with good heart: Thanks, Obama. https://t.co/IeumTasRNN\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) January 17, 2017\n\nThe political reaction to Manning's impending release from prison -- by May 17 -- was swift and critical.\n\n\"Manning stabbed his fellow soldiers in the back by releasing classified information and putting their lives at risk,\" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN's Dana Bash. \n\n\"President Obama, by granting clemency to Manning, slapped all those who serve honorably in the face,\" Graham said.\n\nBut Manning's supporters, who have spent years calling on Obama to grant clemency, arguing that her act was motivated by a desire to expose abuses by US troops on the battlefield.\n\nManning's sentence was \"grossly disproportionate, it was far longer than any any that had previously been imposed for offenses related to the leak of sensitive information,\" Maria McFarland Sanchez-Moreno, of the US division of Human Rights Watch, told CNN International. \"The message that was sent by such a long sentence was that people who release classified information even if it is released in the pubic interest, even if it doesn't cause severe harm, will be prosecuted. That could have a chilling effect going forward on other whistleblowers who might have information about abuses, human rights violations, fraud, corruption to disclose.\"\n\nThis story has been updated", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.6875, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 831, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.6109131951499998, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.16606498194946, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/opinions/trump-failed-first-test-cupp/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "In first test, Trump makes big mistake", "wordcount_as_scraped": 783, "date": "20161114180000", "story_content": "It was the first serious test of Donald Trump's leadership, and it would send an important and clear message to a country that is both excited by and terrified of his presidency.\n\n \n\nAnd yet, in true Trump fashion, his appointment of both Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon to \"equal\" leadership posts in his cabinet has accomplished little but confusion and continued consternation over who Trump intends to be as president.\n\n \n\nHis dilemma was clear. The chief of staff position was going to be scrutinized to the hilt, and he narrowed it down to two choices. In picking Priebus, the steady Republican National Committee chair with the folksy Wisconsin accent, he would reassure moderate Republicans and even some Democrats that he was shifting into a more conventional governance, and away from the more divisive elements he borrowed from Bannon's alt-right base. \n\nBut in picking Bannon, president of Breitbart News, he'd pledge his fealty to his loudest supporters, reward their loyalty and show his commitment to the anti-establishment anger that got him elected. \n\n \n\nBoth appointments, however, were fraught with peril. Priebus is the embodiment of the establishment, which is why he is reassuring to anti-Trumpers, but often reviled by Trump's base. Trump himself once called Priebus's RNC a \"disgrace\" and said \"Reince Priebus should be ashamed of himself\" for running what he alleged was a rigged primary.\n\n \n\nFurther, to many Never-Trump conservatives, Priebus is to blame for ushering Trump through the primary process, forgiving his many controversial transgressions, and forcing him to sign a loyalty pledge to a party for which he has shown little affection. Later, during the general election, Priebus threatened principled Republicans like John Kasich and Jeb Bush that if they didn't support Trump, they should reconsider ever running again, a move that little resembled the diplomatic Green Bay Packers fan and reeked more of his bullying nominee. \n\n \n\nBut Steve Bannon was a far more controversial pick. His website is rife with bigoted, anti-Semitic, homophobic, misogynist and just plain creepy content that got a huge platform boost thanks to Trump and Bannon's campaign collaboration. What was once just a fringy dark corner of the far-right came out of the shadows and into the mainstream, leading to disturbing moments on the trail, like the Trump supporter in Phoenix who yelled \"Jew-S-A\" at the press pen. \n\nThe rise of Bannon's Breitbart has rightly terrified the left and the Never-Trump right. If we thought the kind of unabashed and open prejudice that marked earlier generations had been killed off by modernity, the alt-right was here to prove otherwise. The night before the election, Ann Coulter lamented on Twitter, \"If only people with at least 4 grandparents born in America were voting, Trump would win in a 50-state landslide.\" White nationalism wasn't dead -- it had just been in hiding.\n\n \n\nStill, if we've learned anything about Donald Trump over the past three decades, it's that more is always better. So instead of choosing one of these two architects of the Trump presidency to become his top aide, on Sunday he chose both, appointing Priebus as chief of staff and Bannon as chief strategist. \n\nSplitting the baby to please everyone usually pleases no one. And this move has many wringing their hands in frustration. The country wants clarity, and this provides none. A Trump statement insists both men will have equal roles, but surely Trump will lean on one more heavily. Which one?\n\n \n\nThis was a huge missed opportunity. The new GOP, under a President Trump, has three white guys at the top, one of whom runs a pro-white media company. This sure looks more like the America of the 1950s than one of the future.\n\n \n\nThe idea that Trump only had these two options is also hugely shortsighted. If he were truly a courageous visionary, he could have chosen Kellyanne Conway, his tireless campaign manager who brilliantly steered him through the final harrowing months of his flailing campaign, attempting, with some success, to keep him on message and away from dumpster fires.\n\n \n\nInstead of head-scratching and more scrutiny, the appointment of Conway would have been met with immense positivity from both sides of the aisle and signaled to the country that he was both committed to his cause but also serious about uniting the nation. \n\nEmpowering both Bannon and Priebus shows he's only serious about uniting the Republican Party, which isn't likely to occur with Bannon still in the picture.\n\n \n\nI didn't vote for Trump, but I want him to succeed, and that has to start with a clear vision that brings the country together. Hopefully, in his next crucial appointments, he can worry less about rewarding his accomplices and more about what's best for the nation.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.27906978130341, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 775, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.42916167562, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114180000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 2, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.70967741935484, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/health/boxer-santa-cruz-cancer-father/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e1": [1626]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 609, "scraper_regex": 643}}, "headline": "Boxer battles for title as his father battles cancer", "wordcount_as_scraped": 643, "date": "20170123200000", "story_content": "Leo Santa Cruz snaps off punches, making loud pops on sparring mitts. He is just days away from trying to win back his super featherweight boxing title and avenge the only loss of his professional boxing career, a unanimous decision to undefeated Carl Frampton in July.\n\nThe loss still rings in Leo's ears, like a stiff jab to the side of the head, because his father and trainer, Jose Santa Cruz Sr., missed out on critical weeks of training and preparing Leo. Jose, sitting ringside, is battling the ultimate body blow -- cancer.\n\n\"When I first found out he had cancer I cried; I imagined myself suffering,\" Leo Santa Cruz told CNN. \"They say when you have cancer it's very hard to defeat it.\"\n\nJose managed to climb up ringside to watch his son fight Northern Ireland's dangerous Frampton, but Leo believes he suffered without the constant pushing he usually got from his dad.\n\nJose got knocked down by what the family called stage III multiple myeloma and renal failure. After his April 2016 diagnosis, the family said, a spinal disc collapsed, requiring reconstructive spine surgery in May 2016. Radiation followed and two types of chemotherapy.\n\nJose is now in remission, but still getting one form of the chemotherapy.\n\n\"The toughest part right now physically is the chemotherapy, because it comes with a lot of side effects,\" Jose explained to CNN through an interpreter. \"I'm suffering from having a swollen stomach and my feet feel like they are on fire. But (I) have not been afraid of the cancer.\"\n\nFearless defines the Santa Cruz family, originally from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, and now living in and around neighborhoods east of Los Angeles. Jose and his wife, Elodia, have four sons and a daughter.\n\nThe youngest, Leo, 28 years old, remembers being so poor that they took a bus to boxing training because they couldn't afford to put gas in the car.\n\nLeo slugged his way to millions of dollars in the boxing ring and his dad now drives a Corvette.\n\nWhen Leo fights Frampton at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas on January 28, they will introduce him as \"El Terremoto\" -- \"the earthquake\" in Spanish.  Frampton is called \"The Jackal.\" \n\nThe fighters, both around 125 pounds, deliver and receive blows in an era when many boxers plod around the ring refusing to mix it up at the risk of getting hit hard.\n\n\"I am really training hard for the rematch, for all the fans that I let down in the first fight,\" said Leo at his La Puente training facility. \n\n\"I want to tell (fans) thank you, I am going to try to give them the best fight and the best show, as long as I can.  As long as my body is able.\"\n\nLeo is the superstar among the boxers training inside the gym, but you wouldn't know it. There's no bling, no pre-fight boasting -- just tireless effort with jump ropes, speed bags, heavy bags and sparring. Jose simulates punches and chirps commands to Leo as he spars with his brother, Antonio.\n\nThe father stops only when a nurse walks up to him ringside and delivers a sharp reminder of his cancer fight at the end of a needle. The nurse then begins a weekly test and drains blood from Jose's arm. \n\n\"He's strong, he's doing well, he's definitely pushing through,\" said his nurse, Jennae Fischer. \"He's driven and he is doing what he has to do to get better.\"\n\nJose, who is never seen in public without his cowboy hat, makes an uncharacteristic slip from the family's usual penchant for humility. \n\n\"For this fight, I want to make a promise to his (Leo's) audience,\" says Jose, sitting in the same chair where his blood was just drawn.\n\n\"(Leo) is not only going to beat him, he is going to beat him down.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.470938682556151, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 609, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 10, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.9625764975999997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.95566502463054, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/06/us/sea-world-orca-tilikum-dies/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 695, "scraper_regex": 803}}, "headline": "Killer whale at center of 'Blackfish' dies ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 803, "date": "20170107020000", "story_content": "Tilikum, the killer whale involved in the deaths of three people, including SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010, has died, SeaWorld reported Friday. \n\nTilikum was at the center of the 2013 CNN documentary \"Blackfish.\"\n\n\"Tilikum passed away early this morning, January 6, surrounded by the trainers, care staff and veterinarians that provided him around-the-clock world-class care,\" SeaWorld said on its website. \n\nSeaWorld reported in March that the orca -- estimated then to be 35 -- may be dying.

The whale was near the high end of the average life expectancy for male killer whales according to an independent scientific review.\n\n\"While the official cause of death will not be determined until the necropsy is completed, the SeaWorld veterinarians were treating a persistent and complicated bacterial lung infection,\" SeaWorld said Friday. \n\n\"The suspected bacteria is part of a group of bacteria that is found in water and soil both in wild habitats and zoological settings.\" \n\nTreatment included \"combinations of anti-inflammatories, anti-bacterials, anti-nausea medications, hydration therapy and aerosolized antimicrobial therapy,\" according to SeaWorld.  \n\n\"Tilikum's life will always be inextricably connected with the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Dawn Brancheau,\" the SeaWorld statement added. \n\nBrancheau, 40, died in 2010 from \"multiple traumatic injuries and drowning\" after the 12,000-pound killer whale grabbed her ponytail and pulled her underwater in front of shocked onlookers at Shamu Stadium, the Orange County Sheriff's office reported then. \n\nRescuers were not immediately able to reach Brancheau because of the \"whale's aggressive nature,\" the sheriff's office said at the time.\n\nShe was recovered by SeaWorld staff members after Tilikum was coaxed into a smaller pool and lifted out of the water by a large platform on the bottom of the smaller tank, authorities said.\n\nTilikum had been linked to two other deaths. He and two other whales were involved in the drowning of a trainer at a Victoria, British Columbia, marine park in 1991. The trainer fell into the whale tank at the Sea Land Marine Park Victoria and was dragged underwater as park visitors watched.\n\nIn 1999, Tilikum was also blamed for the death of a 27-year-old man whose body was found floating in a tank at SeaWorld, the apparent victim of a whale's \"horseplay,\" authorities said then. The sheriff's office said the man apparently hid in the park until after it closed, then climbed into the tank.\n\nTilikum was captured off the coast of Iceland and sired 21 calves in captivity.

He said he arrived at the hospital in 15 minutes and took the child in his arms, warning people who might cry to leave the room. \n\nHe repeated the heart-wrenching exchange nearly word for word in subsequent interviews, with the same impact.\n\n\"I've gotten a big response to this,\" Venable told CNN. \"People have told me that they were crying when they read it, and I tell them that I was crying when I wrote it.\" \n\nThe story began to unravel on Tuesday, when Snopes ran a piece scrutinizing Schmitt-Matzen's account. \n\n\"The story kept spreading but with no second sourcing,\" Arturo Garcia, the Snopes reporter who wrote the follow-up, told CNNMoney. \"I think part of the issue here is that a lot of outlets don't give their reporters time to vet these things.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.51479291915894, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 622, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.43739893644, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 6, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.964630225080386, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.545454545455}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/09/politics/isis-dead-us-military/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Military: 50,000 ISIS fighters killed", "wordcount_as_scraped": 615, "date": "20161209160000", "story_content": "As many as 50,000 ISIS fighters have been killed since the war against the terror group began, a senior US military official told CNN.        \n\nThe official called that figure a conservative estimate.\n\nISIS recruitment also has fallen off. It recruited only several hundred foreign fighters this year, compared with a couple thousand a month last year, CNN has learned.  \n\nIn addition, the official also revealed Thursday that in May 2015, US special operations forces came \"tantalizingly close\" to capturing or killing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi in Raqqa, but failed to do so because classified information was leaked to the news media.\n\nThe official briefed reporters at the Pentagon on the condition his name not be used due to the sensitivity of the information. \n\nThe official noted that after the May 2015 raid in Syria that killed ISIS operative Abu Sayyaf and led to the capture of his wife, the US got valuable information on Baghdadi from the wife after two days of interrogation.\n\nAt the time, she told them \"last week we were with Al Baghdadi in Raqqa,\" the official said. \"We had been tracking them in Raqqa, so we went back frantically to try to figure out where he (Baghdadi) was in Raqqa.\"\n\nBut the official said communications that were being monitored dried up which the official blamed news stories that were published about intelligence learned from the raid.\n\nThe senior military official also disclosed that earlier this week when President Barack Obama visited the US military in Florida he privately spoke about the incoming Trump administration to General Joseph Votel, head of US Central Command, and General Tony Thomas, head of US Special Operations Command.\n\n\"He asked specifically are there things we could be doing as an administration\" to assist a smooth transition on military issues such as fighting ISIS and counterterrorism, the official said. The official would not discuss Votel's answer but broadly noted that Thomas spoke about some changes to how special operations interact with the rest of the government. \n\nThe bulk of the meeting with reporters dealt with the issue of special operations taking a leading role in coordinating across the entire US government efforts to counter extremist threats against the US and coalition partners originating from overseas.\n\nThe matter has caused bureaucratic headaches inside the Pentagon and Congress over the question of whether special operations forces like Delta Force and Navy Seals will operate overseas more than they already do. The official insisted special operations have no new authorities to operate. But special operations forces will set up a new center to coordinate their operations with coalition forces and other government agencies at an \"undisclosed location,\" the official said.\n\nThe official revealed for the last 18 months there has been a US military policy that airstrikes are only allowed against targets where 10 or less civilians might be killed.\n\nIn a related matter, special operations is also set to become the leading part of the military for \"countering weapons of mass destruction,\" taking that role over from the US Strategic Command.\n\nThere is growing concern that North Korea is edging closer to being able to deploy a nuclear weapon. The official said the US believes it has the capability to mate a nuclear warhead, missile and delivery system.\n\n\"It's the threat that keeps me awake at night,\" the official said. The only issue holding the North Koreans off at this point appears to be they have not mastered the technology to make a weapon re-enter the earth's atmosphere to reach its target. All of this is leading to stepped up \"contingency planning,\" to deal with North Korea's nuclear capability if it came to that, the official said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.2841091156005902, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 592, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.56163687338, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.36486486486486, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/07/politics/isis-surprise-obama/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "ISIS rise surprised Obama, US intelligence", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1259, "date": "20161207180000", "story_content": "Fareed Zakaria examines the triumphs and struggles during President Barack Obama's time in the White House. Watch \"The Legacy of Barack Obama\" on Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nISIS' march across Iraq and Syria -- a campaign that's forced President Barack Obama to return small numbers of US troops to the region, even after touting an end to the decade-long ground offensives there -- came as a surprise to US intelligence, the President told CNN in a new special report. \n\nThe terror organization's rise in a tumultuous Middle East has provided Obama some of the toughest decisions of his presidency, choices that CNN's Fareed Zakaria explores in \"The Legacy of Barack Obama\" airing Wednesday. \n\n\"The ability of ISIL to not just mass inside of Syria, but then to initiate major land offensives that took Mosul, for example, that was not on my intelligence radar screen,\" Obama told Zakaria, using the administration's term for the Islamic State terror group.\n\nAs Obama's presidency concludes, it's clearer than ever he'll depart the White House with Syrians facing nearly unyielding misery.\n\n \n\nThe city of Aleppo has become a nightmare for the tens of thousands of Syrians still living there, short on food and medical supplies as cold winter weather sets in. The conflict has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, spurred a destabilizing refugee crisis in Europe, and led to the rise of a terror group that Obama admits he didn't see coming.\n\nIt's a legacy he says haunts him, but as he explains to Zakaria in Wednesday's special, the decisions he did make were the best he could muster in a country with no good choices.\n\nAvoiding a large scale ground conflict in Syria \"is the smartest decision from a menu of bad options that were available to us,\" he told Zakaria for the special, which airs at 9 p.m. ET on CNN.\n\nIn interviews with Obama and those who worked in his administration during the early days of the Syrian conflict, a picture emerges of a president conflicted about how best to avoid the bloody reality that eventually emerged.\n\n \n\nHe ran for office vowing to end large-scale troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, sensing the American people were war-weary after a decade of combat. He fulfilled his promises by the time he came up for reelection in 2012, giving him a campaign trail talking point that helped him defeat Republican rival Mitt Romney.\n\nIn Iraq, Obama's withdrawal plan was hastened by the expiration of an agreement signed in 2008 by President George W. Bush allowing US troops to remain in the country. Some of Obama's generals wanted to keep 10,000 US troops in Iraq to maintain stability in the country as it emerged from a decade of war. But negotiations between Washington and Baghdad on extending the agreement fell apart when then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki refused to agree to the Obama administration's terms.\n\nSome have accused Obama of failing to press hard enough for a new \"status of forces agreement.\" On Tuesday, Obama argued it wouldn't have made a difference in preventing the rise of ISIS.\n\n\"Maintaining American troops at the time could not have reversed the forces that contributed to ISIL's rise: a government in Baghdad that pursued a sectarian agenda, a brutal dictator in Syria that lost control of large parts of the country, social media that reached a global pool of recruits, and a hollowing out of Iraq's security forces,\" Obama said during remarks at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida.\n\nThe decision to remove all US troops from Iraq provided Donald Trump with a rhetorical bludgeon during this year's presidential campaign. He accused Obama and Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton of leaving a power vacuum in Iraq that allowed ISIS to take hold.\n\nIt's an assessment that's impossible to prove right or wrong. Obama's top military advisers express doubt that keeping a residual force of US troops would have prevented ISIS' rise.\n\n\"I don't know whether 10,000 troops would have given us the leverage. I suspect it might not have. But I would have liked to have tested the proposition,\" said David Petraeus, who served as commander of US Central Command and of US forces in Afghanistan under Obama before becoming CIA director. He's now under consideration for a role in Trump's administration.\n\nIn neighboring Syria, another crisis was unfolding as President Bashar al-Assad began a brutal assault on opposition forces. Assad's crackdown drew jihadists from Iraq, where the al-Qaeda affiliate morphed in the terror group now known as ISIS.\n\nObama viewed the crisis dimly. He was skeptical the opposition forces there were large or organized enough to amount to a real challenge to Assad's regime -- even as his advisers recommended arming moderate rebels.\n\n\"There was a time and there was a way to help moderate in the opposition prevailed,\" said Robert Ford, the US Ambassador to Syria from 2010 to 2014. \"Absolutely we missed an opportunity.\"\n\n \n\nIt wasn't until Assad crossed his self-declared \"red line\" of deploying chemical weapons on civilians that Obama began ordering his military to prepare for a military strike in Syria. But he backed away from ordering the mission, asking for support from Congress that never came.\n\nSome viewed the move as backing away from a firm commitment to respond to a horrific crime against civilians, including children. Obama argues his approach to instead help broker a deal that ridded Assad of his chemical weapons stockpiles, was a smarter approach.\n\n\"We, in fact, positioned our military to be able to strike Assad if he did not give up his chemical weapons,\" Obama told Zakaria. \"And the fact is, he got rid of his chemical weapons in an unprecedented way.\"\n\nBut the civil war continued to rage, and ISIS began taking ground. It established Raqqa, in northern Syria, as its capital. And it began moving into Iraq, including in cities with names well-known to Americans -- Mosul, Fallujah, Ramadi, the cites of key battles during the Iraq War.\n\n\"When you have these ungoverned spaces, that's exactly where extremist like to go to setup,\" said Ford. \"They can plan. They can organize. They can recruit. They can do training. That's what they need.\"\n\nThe US, along with a 60-nation coalition, has been pounding the group with airstrikes for more than two years, and US special operators have worked to train and assist Iraqi Security Forces and vetted rebel groups in Syria.\n\nThe efforts have squeezed ISIS on the battlefield, reducing its territory and taking out key figures in its leadership. A campaign to retake Mosul, the group's base in Iraq, is making progress.\n\nBut the wins on the battlefield haven't stopped the group from spreading their hate abroad. Attacks in Paris, Brussels, Nice, San Bernardino, and Orlando all had varying degrees of ISIS links, leading to new terror fears a decade-and-a-half after September 11, 2001.\n\nObama has insisted the US is safer, noting that a large-scale attack like the one of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon hasn't transpired while he's been in office.\n\nIn a region with few good choices, he says there's little any president could have devised that would have made much of a difference.\n\n\"Have we been flawless in the execution of what is a complicated policy in the region? Absolutely not. I think flawless is not available when it comes to foreign policy or the presidency, at least with mere mortals like me at the helm,\" he told Zakaria. \"But have we made, I think, the best decisions that were available to us, at each stage? The answer is yes.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.4194529056549103, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1211, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.28784387637, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.80759702725021, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/19/architecture/london-illuminated-city-river-thames-london/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a3": [2989, 3029]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 530, "scraper_regex": 570}}, "headline": "Painting with light on London's River Thames", "wordcount_as_scraped": 570, "date": "20161220020000", "story_content": "The River Thames is probably London's most iconic symbol, but after dark it's an invisible artery silently snaking through the heart of the city.\n\nThat's set to change thanks to an ambitious competition designed to bring the famous river to life with a series of beautiful light installations. \n\nLaunched in 2016, the Illuminated River design competition called for a pioneering light scheme for central London's bridges along the River Thames, and received more than 105 entries from 20 countries.\n\nThis month, the design of American light artist Leo Villareal and British architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands was crowned the winner, beating five shortlisted competitors.\n\nWhen implemented, their design will be the largest public art exhibition in the city's history. \n\nLet there be light\n\nThis isn't Villareal's first river rodeo. \n\nTrained as a sculptor, the American visual artist showcased his ability to \"paint with light\" in a similar 2013 public project The Bay Lights, which illuminated the San Francisco Bay Bridge. \n\nThe London project will be even more ambitious, covering six nautical miles and potentially spanning 17 bridges, starting from the western Albert Bridge and finishing at Tower Bridge.\n\nThe team's \"Current\" design is driven by a computer algorithm. Discreet sensors monitor the motion of the river -- such as high tide and low tide -- and send that data back to Villareal's computer program, which uses it to create \"kinetic light art.\"\n\n\"Villareal paints with light and his paintbox is a computer software program,\" Sarah Gaventa, director of the Illuminated River Foundation,  tells CNN. \"The idea that it's programmed means we can update it, tweak it, and adjust it whenever we need.\n\nThe light display will change depending on the tide. For instance, in low tide, the underbellies of the bridges may glow softly.\n\n\"(Villareal) will sit by the river and test out different approaches and effects to make sure it's right. As he tests the effects the public will see it. It's not a question of putting lamps on a bridge and pushing one button.\"\n\nThe dynamic light exhibition will change from bridge to bridge in order to showcase the unique architecture of each structure.   \n\n\"Each bridge has to be controlled separately to enhance the architectural qualities and remain sensitive to that,\" says Gaventa.\n\nThe runners up\n\nEntrants were asked to think of London's bridges -- many of which, such as the 130-year-old Tower Bridge, are historic -- as canvases on which they could paint with light.\n\nThe six finalists included Adjaye Associates' proposed \"Blurring Boundaries,\" featuring bold patterns from international artists where lighting would be attached to the bridges themselves, while architecture and design studio AL_A's \"The Eternal Story\" saw the bottoms of the bridges glow with a warm amber light during low tide. \n\nRelying on private donations, the Illuminated River Foundation has currently raised \u00a310 million ($124,805) of the estimated \u00a320 million needed to fund the project. \n\nWork will commence next year, with an aim to see the first phase completed by the end of 2018, but Gaventa says the whole project could take years to implement, due to several logistical hurdles. \n\nEach bridge is owned and operated by a different entity, and the team will need to consider public opinion and their work's impact on local fish, birds and bats -- all of which could be affected by the lights, which the competition promises will be \"very discreet\".\n\n\"Over the next 5 years, or longer, London's Thames will be transformed,\" says Gaventa.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.7972028255462598, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 530, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.00412797137, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.5094339622641497, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/02/politics/russia-fake-news-reality/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1388, "scraper_regex": 1530}}, "headline": "The reality behind Russia's fake news", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1530, "date": "20161202120000", "story_content": "The 2016 presidential race was rife with disinformation, none more blatant than fake news -- hoaxes, half-truths, outright lies -- that flashed through the internet at warp speed.\n\nTake, for example, \"Pizzagate,\" a made-up story of a pedophilia ring supposedly being run out of a Washington, D.C. pizza parlor by none other than Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nFueled by conspiracy theorists posting on social media sites like Reddit, Facebook and Twitter, the story picked up so much traction that The New York Times and the Washington Post were forced to track it down, finally debunking it.\n\nThen there were the stories about Clinton's health. Not just her actual September bout with pneumonia, but other stories claiming she had a brain injury and was losing her mind.\n\nThe Kremlin connection\n\nWestern media, for the most part, are blaming Moscow, accusing the Kremlin of exploiting fake news to damage Clinton, help elect Donald Trump, and undermine the American electorate's faith in their government.\n\nThe Kremlin has consistently denied it tried to interfere in the election.\n\nTwo new studies that were cited by media outlets, including the Washington Post, claim Russia used \"thousands of botnets, teams of paid human 'trolls,' and networks of websites and social-media accounts\" to \"echo and amplify\" false or misleading tweets, Facebook posts, videos and media reports.\n\nThe first study -- \"Trolling for Trump: How Russia is Trying to Destroy Our Democracy\" -- appeared in early November in War on the Rocks, an online magazine.\n\n\"Russia's propaganda mechanisms primarily aim for \"alt-right and more traditional right-wing and fascist parties,\" Clint Watts, one of the co-authors of the paper, tells CNN, but they're also \"hitting across any group in the United States that is anti-government, or fomenting dissent or conspiracies against the US government and its institutions.\"\n\nWatts, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and senior fellow at the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University co-authored the study alongside two other researchers, Andrew Weisburd and J.M. Berger.\n\n\"It's not exclusive to Trump,\" Watts explains. \"They are huge in the white nationalist community. That's where we saw them before they went to Trump. And then they try on the left as well.\"\n\nWho's behind the misinformation push?\n\nWatts says that, during the election campaign, three main groups traded in fake news: passionate Trump supporters; people out to make money by driving followers to their websites with \"click bait\" stories; and the Russian propaganda apparatus.\n\nEach group used social platforms differently and the research team used various social media metrics to distinguish the behavior among them. Content from \"click bait profiteers,\" for example, is absorbed in a different way to propaganda content.\n\n\"If you're just trying to sell something it's more like an Amazon advertisement,\" Watts explains. \"The Russian propaganda system would have what you would call 'horizontal conversations' -- a discussion for influence purposes.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean Moscow would turn down an opportunity to exploit fake news created by someone else who supports the Russian line.\n\n\"They'll use it too,\" he says. \"They see it as free propaganda.\"\n\nBut importantly, Watts says, Russia's goal wasn't just to elect Trump. \"The goal is to erode trust in mainstream media, public figures, government institutions -- everything that holds the unity of the Republic together.\"\n\nTrapped in social 'echo chamber'\n\nThe second study was conducted by an anonymous, self-described \"non-partisan collection of researchers with foreign policy, military and technology backgrounds\" who call themselves PropOrNot.\n\nThe group says it, too, analyzed tweets and other social media messages ricocheting around the web and found many of the same phrases, which it interpreted as indicating that they came from the same single source.\n\nIn some cases, fake news was spread knowingly; in other cases, activists and others simply picked up and passed on tidbits they liked, in what the authors describe as an \"online echo chamber.\"\n\nTheir conclusion: Russia has made \"large-scale, long-term efforts to build online 'fake news' propaganda outlets with significant audiences in the US.\"\n\n\"We are not exaggerating Russia's influence,\" the group told CNN in an emailed statement. \"Many different groups spew fake news but Russia is currently the industry leader.\"\n\nZuckerberg: Idea that fake news influenced election is 'crazy'\n\nA fake news blacklist\n\nPropOrNot's report lists 200 websites that qualify, according to their criteria, as \"Russian propaganda outlets\" reaching, they claim, at least 15 million Americans. The effort, they say, is \"at least semi-centralized.\"\n\n\"There are varying degrees of involvement in it, and awareness of involvement,\" their report says. \"Some people involved seem genuinely unaware that they are being used by Russia to produce propaganda, but many others seem to know full well.\"\n\nBut other digital experts criticize that approach, saying it is too broad and includes sites that are legitimately expressing their own views, even if they happen to coincide with Russia's messaging.\n\nAs Ben Nimmo, information defense fellow with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, puts it: \"There's more to this than the Kremlin.\"\n\n\"To reduce this all to 'Oh, it's the Russians doing it' is to ignore the very real problem that there is the alt-right doing this in the US, and you've got convinced people in Germany and France who are doing this. You've got people in the UK as well, apparently as of their own conviction,\" he says.\n\n\"If they all hate America, and they all hate Clinton, and they all hate America having an active foreign policy, sure they're going to share stuff.\"\n\nIn a written statement emailed to CNN, PropOrNot defended both its methods and its mission.\n\n\"Our list was never intended to be 'black.' We highlight these outlets because we believe that the public should be able to know that very disparate kinds of online outlets frequently display a strong bias towards Russia in ways that echo, repeat, are used by, and redirect their audiences to Russian official and semi-official state media. We highlight. Unlike the Russian government, we do not censor.\"\n\nSince the report's publication, the group says it has removed some websites -- ones that \"have made a case for their independence\" -- from its list. In other cases, it says, it has added new sites \"especially ones which are directly owned and controlled by governments that suppress and restrict free media.\"\n\n'Firehose of falsehood'\n\nA third study by the Rand Corporation and George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs delves even further into what it labels Russia's \"firehose of falsehood.\"\n\n\"The Russian propaganda model,\" the report says, \"is high-volume and multichannel, and it disseminates messages without regard for the truth. It is also rapid, continuous, and repetitive, and it lacks commitment to consistency.\"\n\nWatch: Did fake news help elect Donald Trump?\n\nAll that makes it extremely difficult to counter, the report says. Facebook and Google have promised to crack down on fake news but it appears little has been done so far. After outlining measures to prevent the proliferation of more fake news on Facebook, the social platform's CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote: \"We've made significant progress, but there is more work to be done.\"\n\nWhat Russian media thinks\n\nRT, the Russian media company, and the Russian news service Sputnik -- both state-financed -- feature prominently in most reports on Russian propaganda. The Washington Post article, quoting researchers, accuses the outlets of \"sometimes\" including \"false and misleading stories in their reports.\"\n\nRT dismisses the Washington Post story as a \"hit piece.\"\n\n\"RT has never engaged in any such activity -- which is, perhaps, why WashPo failed to provide a single piece of evidence or reference,\" Editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonyan, tells CNN.\n\n\"It is particularly troubling,\" she says, \"that, prior to publishing the piece, the Washington Post did not even bother to seek a comment from RT, as a right of reply would be the minimum in standard journalistic practice when making such libelous claims ... It seems ironic that in its eagerness to comment on the 'fake news' phenomenon, the outlet would follow in a similar vein in its own editorial approach.\"\n\nAsked for a response, the Washington Post tells CNN: \"While we did quote the Kremlin denying any interference in the US election, we should also have obtained separate comment from RT, a network funded by the Russian government. Its comment was later included in the online version of the story.\"\n\nSimonyan insists that RT is \"most highly concerned about the 'fake news' phenomenon because ... it is perfectly acceptable for the mainstream media to promote fake news -- as long as it's about Russia or RT.\"\n\nMore leaks ahead?\n\nDuring the US presidential campaigns, most fake news blasted Clinton and praised Trump but expert Clint Watts says the President-elect can't count on Moscow's benign approach continuing.\n\n\"I would assume that if Trump doesn't support Putin's policies then they're next,\" he cautions.\n\nIn spite of Russia's denials and Trump's doubts, cybersecurity experts say Russia likely hacked not only Democrats' emails but Republicans' as well.\n\n\"We think they have thousands of people's emails,\" Watts tells CNN. \"As those people rise in prominence or become more important in a Russia context, [Moscow] will use more and more data dumps to undermine the integrity of people.\n\n\"That's just ammunition.

The seemingly endless line of people waiting to cross over into Brownsville, Texas, was unlike anything they had seen. When the Lopez family's turn came, Yanira Lopez simply told a US immigration officer: \"We came here for your help, to get asylum.\"\n\nThe officer wrote down their information. Lopez said she relaxed for the first time in the long journey. Finally, they had arrived, escaping the crime and violence that made Guatemala one of the dangerous countries in the world.  \n\nThey were given hamburgers and Hershey chocolates. Lopez imagined a joyous reunion with relatives in the US. A short time later, they boarded a bus.\n\n\"We couldn't even imagine where they were taking us,\" Lopez said.\n\nThe family reunion was not to be. Not yet, at least. After a night locked in a temporary holding facility, the Lopez family was transported to another unknown detention center where they would languish for two months.\n\nDespite aggressive US government efforts to stem the flow of Central American migrants crossing the border, more and more families are following the footsteps of Lopez and her children.\n\nLopez arrived one year after the unprecedented 2014 wave of unaccompanied minors and families that crossed the border in what activist called a humanitarian crisis. \n\nThe Obama Administration responded to the 2014 crisis by opening two large family detention centers in Texas: The Karnes County and the South Texas Family Residential Center. \n\nThe initial goal was to deter new families from coming. Instead, the stream of incoming families is growing. Two years ago, 68,445 family units (people who come in groups of two or more family members) were apprehended at the border. In fiscal year 2016 that total swelled to 77,674, according to the US Border Patrol.\n\nThe surge of migrants across the border has been one of the hottest topics in the presidential election.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump went so far as to conflate families apprehended at the border with criminals. \"They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources,\" Trump said at one debate. \"But we have some bad hombres here and we're going to get them out.\"\n\nWhile the number of apprehensions of families on the southwest border spiked in 2016, Department of Homeland Security figures give no indication that families are being released into the population en masse.\n\n\"The government's detention policies here in the United States are not going to stop families from coming if they fear for their safety and their lives because of violence in their home countries,\" said Denise Gilman, an immigration attorney who represents families who are detained.\n\nLike other advocates, she believes the government should treat the surge of women and children coming from Central America as a refugee crisis, not a national security threat.\n\n\"Under US asylum law, the way you seek refugee status is to come to the US,\" Gilman said. \"That is provided for in the law. That is not law breaking.\"\n\nBefore 2014, women and children claiming asylum were rarely placed in detention. \n\nFamilies were processed and given a court order where they could pursue their claim. Then they were released at the border to go live with relatives in the country.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) maintains that family detention centers are a key part of its strategy to prevent illegal immigration.\n\n\"The centers allow for prompt removal of individuals arriving as families who have not stated a claim for relief under our laws,\" said an ICE spokesman who asked not to be identified by name.\n\nIn response to growing concerns about detaining women and children, Homeland Security appointed a committee of independent experts to advise them on family detention and help reform its practices. In late September, the committee said in a draft report that \"detention is generally neither appropriate nor necessary for families... DHS should discontinue the general use of family detention.\"\n\nThe official report is to be published this month. ICE's spokesman did not comment on the upcoming report but said DHS has limited the amount of time women and children are detained. He said the majority of families seeking asylum are detained for 20 days or less.\n\nTo win asylum, a person has to prove persecution because of race, religion, national origin, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Passing the \"credible fear interview\" means you'll have a chance to convince a judge. Failing it means your days in the United States are likely numbered.\n\nFor those families who can't immediately travel to join relatives or don't have a place to live, Gilman says there are other solutions beyond detention like voluntary refugee shelter.\n\nAfter Yanira Lopez and her three children -- two sons ages 14 and 17, and a 6-year-old daughter -- passed their interview, she was released from Karnes Family Residential Center in Texas. She went to live at Casa de Raices, a San Antonio refugee shelter for families released from detention.\n\nShe was only supposed to stay in the house a few days, but she decided to stay there and help after seeing all the other mothers released from detention.\n\n\"The idea is for them to feel relaxed and to forget for a moment what they endured during their journey,\" Lopez says.\n\nShe described her own experience in detention centers as traumatic. She felt trapped, like a prisoner. She wanted be free and simply go to the park with her children or take a walk to the store. Lopez said she was verbally abused by detention center workers and health services were inadequate.\n\n\"We come here for help,\" she says, \"and they treat you worse than an animal, worse than a criminal.\"\n\nLopez believes the stay in detention will have a lasting psychological effect on her children.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics agrees, saying in a September report that detention centers \"do not meet appropriate standards for the safety and well-being of children.\"\n\nICE contends the detention centers are safe. On its website, the agency includes a list of safety and health standards for family residential centers.\n\nToday, there are three family detention centers in the US: The two facilities in Texas and the Berks County Detention Facility in Pennsylvania, which opened before the 2014 spike in family border crossings. ICE says it pays an average of $342.73 per day for each individual detained. \n\nSo far in 2016 there have been a total of 44,558 recorded bookings in family detention. \n\nYanira Lopez's case is still pending. She now has a work permit and a Social Security number. Her three children are doing well in school. And this summer they moved into an apartment in San Antonio, their first in the United States.\n\n \"It's a dream come true,\" she says. \"To be able to show the government that we are going to pay our bills and that we are good people, not delinquents.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 46, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.0351438522338903, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1157, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 12.8307481923, "HarmVirtue": 11, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 46, "mft_sum": 76, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161102120000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 6.909090909089999, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 6.56871218668971, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/18/politics/tom-price-conflicts-interest-oge-ethics-office/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 593, "scraper_regex": 637}}, "headline": "Ethics office tweets in middle of Tom Price hearing", "wordcount_as_scraped": 637, "date": "20170118200000", "story_content": "The Office of Government Ethics Wednesday sent a series of four tweets outlining its procedures examining incoming Trump administration officials -- right in the middle of a contentious Senate hearing about Rep. Tom Price's stock transactions.\n\nThe OGE tweets did not specifically cite Price, his financial holdings or the Senate hearing.\n\nThe tweets came less than an hour after Price -- President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be secretary of Health and Human Services -- defended himself against questions about his stock transactions at a Senate hearing and invoked the ethics office's approval.\n\nUnder questioning about his investments, Price cited the Office of Government Ethics and its \"diligence\" in its role reviewing all Cabinet nominees' financial records.\n\n\"We have agreed to every single recommendation that they've made to divest of whatever holdings we have that might even give the appearance of a possible conflict,\" Price said.\n\nCNN reported on Monday that financial disclosures show Price invested in a medical device manufacturer days before introducing a bill that would benefit that company. Democrats including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have called for an investigation into whether Price may have violated the law. \n\nPrice has said the stocks were purchased through a broker and that he did not know which stocks he owned. \n\nHe repeated that he did nothing inappropriate and pointed to disclosures he made to OGE that were signed off on in the nomination process. \n\nThe ethics office's tweets came shortly thereafter, with messages outlining what it does -- and doesn't -- do.\n\n\"OGE's focus is prevention; IGs investigate potential misconduct & @TheJusticeDept prosecutes criminal violations,\" OGE tweeted shortly thereafter. \n\n\"OGE oversees the executive branch #ethics program, while Congress & the Courts have their own ethics programs,\" they continued. \"OGE does not handle complaints of misconduct. Please learn where & how to report #fed employee misconduct,\" the agency wrote, including links to its missions and procedures.\n\nOGE did not comment on the tweets on the record.\n\nThough the tweet did not specially refer to Price, the OGE has tangled with the incoming Trump administration before.\n\nThe office's Twitter account has been vocal in advocating for full divestment by President-elect Donald Trump, which Trump is not opting to do, and the chief of the office has been vocal about his concerns. \n\nAn expert on ethics and former Federal Election Commission general counsel said Price's submission to OGE would not have been scrutinized for past actions. \n\n\"The Office of Government ethics reviews his current situation for potential conflicts of interest and negotiates an agreement with how he should handle (divestment) in the future,\" Larry Noble, general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said about Price's testimony. \"It does not look at his past activity.\"\n\nNoble also said that purchasing the stock through a broker alone wouldn't mean there are no ethical questions -- saying Price would need to assure he and the broker did not discuss the stock or the bill. \n\n\"The fact of the matter is that I have had no conversations with my broker about any political activity at all other than her congratulating me on my election,\" Price said before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy said that Price appeared to have invested in a number of drug companies before taking action to \"inflate\" those firms' values. \n\n\"Why wouldn't you at least tell her, 'Listen, stay clear of any companies that are directly affected by my legislative work?'\" Murphy asked. \n\n\"Because the agreement that we have is that she'd provide a diversified portfolio, which is exactly what virtually every one of you have in your investment opportunities, and make certain that in order to protect one's assets, that there's a diversified arrangement for purchase of stocks,\" Price said. \"I knew nothing about those purchases.\"\n\nCorrection: The OGE tweets did not specifically cite Price, his financial holdings or the Senate hearing.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.26582276821136, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 593, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 11, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.3327823236, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.20404721753794, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/06/us/chicago-facebook-live-beating/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 790, "scraper_regex": 1087}}, "headline": "Chicago torture video: No bail for 4 suspects", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1087, "date": "20170106150000", "story_content": "Four young people accused of torturing a Chicago special-needs teen and broadcasting the incident on Facebook Live were ordered held without bail Friday afternoon.\n\nThe suspects face hate crime, kidnapping, unlawful restraint and battery charges in their alleged role in the attack. \n\n\"I'm wondering where was the sense of decency that each of you should have had?\" Cook County Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked the suspects. \"When the mom reached out asking about his child ...

He  was friends with one of the suspects, Jordan Hill, and was voluntarily spending time with him, starting on New Year's Eve, she said.\n\nThe attacks started in the back of a stolen van after Hill apparently became angry because the victim's mother called and asked about her son's location, Antonetti said. \n\nHill took the teen to a third-floor apartment in Chicago, where he was bound and gagged, beaten over several days by the two male and two female suspects and forced to drink toilet water, with some of the attacks broadcast on Facebook Live, she said.\n\n\"During the course of the attack, defendant Hill communicated with the victim's mother and demanded $300 ransom in exchange for getting her son back,\" Antonetti said.\n\nThe youth finally escaped Tuesday when police came to the apartment because the suspects argued with second-floor residents who'd complained about the noise, she said. The victim was treated at a hospital and released.\n\nHate crime charges\n\nJordan Hill, 18; Tesfaye Cooper; 18; Brittany Covington, 18; and Tanishia Covington, 24, have each been charged with a hate crime, felony aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. \n\nHill, Cooper and Brittany Covington also face charges of residential burglary. Hill faces an additional charge of possession of a stolen motor vehicle. \n\nPublic defenders Wendy Fawcettt and Megan Tomlinson provided personal details about the defendants, saying Tanishia Covington has two children and Brittany Covington worked as a cashier and attended church.\n\nHill lives with his grandmother and six siblings, ages 14 to 20, and played football in high school, the public defenders said. He'd spent time in jail in for prior convictions, the defenders said.\n\nCooper lives with his mother and six siblings, has a paralyzed brother and had been arrested previously for possession of a controlled substance, the public defenders said.\n\nGraphic video\n\nVideo of the attack shows the victim cowering in a corner of a room, tied up with his mouth bound in plastic. An assailant slashes his sweatshirt with a knife. A woman streaming the abuse on Facebook Live repeatedly turns the camera back to herself. An attacker then takes a knife to the victim's head, carving a patch off his scalp. \n\nFor the next 25 minutes, the abuse continues for the world to see. The victim is repeatedly kicked and punched, but his screams are apparently ignored. \n\nThe graphic footage has stunned the country, not just because of the abuse, but because of the comments made by some of the assailants. \n\n\"*F*ck Donald Trump!\" one attacker shouted in the video. \"F*ck white people!\"\n\nAntonetti , the prosecutor, said the victim was forced to yell \"I love black people\" and \"*F*ck Donald Trump!\"\n\nPolice said the department pursued a hate crime charge because of the victim's diminished mental capacity, the fact that the four suspects tied him up and the racial epithets heard on the video. The victim is white; the suspects are African-American.\n\nFacebook Live is changing our world -- is that a good thing? \n\nPolice: No link with Black Lives Matter\n\nAlthough there is no evidence to support the claim, the far-right quickly pointed the finger at the Black Lives Matter movement as the video spread on social media. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #BLMKidnapping was mentioned more than 480,000 times on Twitter.\n\nPolice have said there's no connection between the activist group and the horrific video.\n\nNeither the Black Lives Matter national organization nor its Chicago chapter responded to CNN's requests for comment Thursday.\n\nDeRay Mckesson, a prominent Black Lives Matter supporter, said those linking the attack to the movement don't have their facts straight.\n\nIt goes without saying that the actions being branded by the far-right as the \"BLM Kidnapping\" have nothing to do w/ the movement.\u2014 deray mckesson (@deray) January 5, 2017\n\n\"It goes without saying that the actions being branded by the far-right as the 'BLM Kidnapping' have nothing to do w/ the movement,\" he tweeted.\n\nA former Chicago police officer, Dimitri Roberts, slammed the notion that the Black Lives Matter movement is to blame. \n\n\"This is hate. And hate doesn't have a color,\" Roberts said. \"So for folks to talk about this is somehow connected to Black Lives Matter is absolutely the wrong way to look at this. ...  And we cannot respond to hate with hate. It's just going to perpetuate the cycle.\" \n\nHow the encounter began\n\nThe victim's parents dropped him off at a McDonald's in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg on Saturday, December 31, to meet a friend.\n\nAntonetti said the teen called home on Saturday and asked to spend the night with the friend and asked the same thing on January 1. On January 2, he stopped communicating with home, Antonetti said.\n\nThat same day, the teen's brother got on Facebook and determined Hill was the friend the victim was with, Antonetti said.\n\nAntonetti said Hill stole a van December 31 and drove around in it with the victim, plus other people. Hill took the youth to the apartment in Chicago, where he was held captive and abused, Antonitti said.\n\nBy Monday, his parents had reported him missing, and they began getting text messages from someone claiming to be holding him captive, police said.\n\nAntonitti said the Facebook Live broadcasts apparently began Tuesday and were shot by Brittany Covington.\n\nWhile the suspects were arguing with neighbors, the victim ran out of the apartment and police found him on the street wearing an inside-out tank top, shorts and sandals on a cold winter day, police said.\n\n\"He was bloodied, he was battered,\" Officer Michael Donnelly said. \"He was very discombobulated.\"\n\nWhile investigating the text messages sent to the victim's parents, police discovered the Facebook video. \n\nAfter viewing the video, investigators determined the victim was the teen found on the street -- and that the people arrested were involved, police said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -9.86078929901123, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 790, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.6479356477, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170106150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0379746835442996, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/01/middleeast/syria-aleppo-operation/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 699, "scraper_regex": 784}}, "headline": "Aleppo rebels band together as Syrian regime tears through city", "wordcount_as_scraped": 784, "date": "20161201110000", "story_content": "Rebel groups in Syria's war-ravaged Aleppo put up a united front on Thursday in a final effort to prevent regime forces from seizing the whole city.\n\nRebels in eastern Aleppo have held ground in the Sheikh Saeed neighborhood as they continue to clash with regime troops, in an attempt to protect the southern parts of the enclave south after Syrian forces made sweeping territorial gains in the north.\n\nSyrian troops backed by militia gunmen loyal to President Bashar al-Assad entered eastern Aleppo on Saturday and have seized the entire northeast. They are now in control of more than 20% of eastern Aleppo. \n\nRebel groups, which have controlled eastern Aleppo for more than four years, on Thursday announced a new alliance, the Aleppo's Army coalition, under the leadership of a rebel named Abu Abdul Rahman Nour.\n\nIn a statement, the coalition said it aimed \"to save Aleppo and its people.\" It is seen a sign that they may be willing to negotiate with the regime under one umbrella.\n\nAt least 40 people were killed in shelling on Thursday as they were trying to flee rebel-held areas, the Aleppo Media Center said. The death toll has reached more than 600 since Saturday, according to various activist groups.\n\nThe regime's ground operation has been backed by intense airstrikes that have caused severe damage to parts of eastern Aleppo.

But Moscow has tried to distance itself from the current assault, denying it is currently bombing the city. \n\nRussia has regularly used its veto power as a permanent member of the council to shoot down resolutions on Syria. China, also a permanent member, has also voted against some of them.\n\nAt the heart of the deadlock is that Russia and Syria consider all rebel groups in the country terrorist groups, while some of the very same rebels are considered moderate by the US and have been armed and supported by Washington to fight ISIS.\n\nUN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien made yet another plea for the council to adopt a resolution put forward by Egypt, New Zealand and Spain for a 10-day pause in the fighting and bombing to allow desperately needed aid into the war zone.\n\n\"For the sake of humanity, we call on, we plead with the parties and those with influence to do everything in their power to protect civilians and enable access to the besieged part of eastern Aleppo before it becomes one giant graveyard,\" O'Brien told council members during the meeting.\n\n'Let Aid In'\n\nSince the ground operation began on Saturday, at least 27,000 people have fled eastern Aleppo neighborhoods, UN humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland told journalists Thursday.\n\nBut around 200,000 people remain, and aid is only reaching those who have fled to the government-controlled west and Kurdish-controlled areas, Egeland said.  \n\nThe UN had hoped Russia and Syria would allow a pause in fighting to gain access to the east, he said, adding that 400 people there were in desperate need of medical evacuation. \n\nThe UN has been looking for a concrete guarantee from Russia and Syria that their aid trucks will be given safe passage.\n\nOut of the 25 aid convoys meant to be delivered in #Syria this month, only 5 were able to get through. #LetAidIn\u2014 Gareth Bayley FCO (@garethbayley) November 30, 2016\n\nGareth Bayley, Britain's special representative for Syria, said just five of 25 planned aid convoys were able to make deliveries in November.\n\nRussia-Turkey tensions\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Moscow was prepared to cooperate with President-elect Donald Trump and his administration on fighting terrorism.\n\nThe Syrian war has also raised tensions between Russia and Turkey. \n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ruffled feathers in Moscow after he said on Tuesday that Ankara sent its forces into Syria to help end \"the rule of the cruel Assad.\" Turkey backs several anti-Assad rebel groups in Syria.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, on Thursday, and the two stood firm on their positions in the conflict, but agreed that a ceasefire was necessary.

Clearly, Obama hopes that relationship will continue, with or without a trans-Atlantic trade pact or the United Kingdom as a part of the European Union.\n\n\"A strong and integrated and united Europe is essential to American national security and to global security and stability,\" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, observed in a briefing before the President's departure, adding that Obama's aim is \"to reinforce our support for the approaches that have been taken over the last eight years to try to promote economic growth, economic security and global cooperation on a whole range of issues.\"\n\nReassuring words for a continent torn with conflicting tensions and challenges, which many fear President-elect Donald Trump seems to have given little thought, at least for the moment. But Rhodes noted, \"We have one president at a time.\" And this President is playing to an eager and receptive audience.\n\nFirst he went to Greece, where Obama is the first US president to visit since Bill Clinton in 1999. Financially, Greece is still the sick man of Europe, and from his opening discussions there, Obama reinforced the importance of the world, but particularly Europe, coming to the financial aid of the country that is also a strategic gateway to the continent -- and the NATO alliance.\n\nGreece has also been a first landing point in Europe for a tsunami of refugees from Syria, Iraq and beyond. With the United States still reluctant to take more than a symbolic handful and with the president-designate threatening to cut that number to zero, Obama's is a critical message of support for a country that is trying desperately to find a humane way to cope with and pass along a tide of humanity that no one seems to want.\n\nFinally, there's the ongoing tension between Greece and Turkey -- the only ongoing feud among NATO allies. The two neighbors still share the tensely divided island of Cyprus. This week's state visit is another strong signal as to which side Obama has chosen in the aftermath of a Turkish political crisis that seems to be spinning rapidly into a nasty dictatorship.\n\nHe ends his final visit to Europe in Germany, the country that works so hard to solve many of these issues. Its leader, Angela Merkel, agreed to bankroll a succession of Greek bailouts, accepted by far the largest share of refugees of any European nation, and has for years played mediator between Greece and Turkey.\n\nPolitically, the Obama trip comes at an opportune moment for the continent as a host of right-wing opposition groups seize on the Trump victory as a signal that their own political prospects may be on the rise.\n\nIn Germany, Merkel has decided to stand for a fourth term as Chancellor, but she faces a host of demons, not least the Alternative for Germany, the anti-immigrant party that recently entered Berlin's state parliament after winning 14% of the vote.\n\nIn Greece, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has managed to hang onto his office for a remarkable 14 months, by dint of a coalition of his left-wing Syriza party with the tiny Independent Greeks. But there are other forces out there waiting eagerly in the wings, such as the far-right Golden Dawn Party, which immediately upon Trump's election, attributed his victory to \"the forces which oppose globalization, are fighting illegal migration and are in favor of clean ethnic states, in favor of self-sufficiency in the national economy.\"\n\nBut on Tuesday, standing next to the Greek leader at a press conference, Obama minced no words as he warned that Europeans \"are less certain of their national identities or their place in the world\" these days. \"It starts looking different and disorienting. And there is no doubt that has produced populist movements, both from the left and the right,\" he said. \"That sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity.

While Trump aides have said some of his statements shouldn't be taken \"literally,\" the tweets offer insight to his foreign policy views and raise a question: When both China and Russia are challenging US power globally, why does he favor Moscow and not Beijing?\n\nTrump's positions on Russia and China mark a sharp turn from current policies -- and that might to the point. Trump and much of the Republican establishment have made clear they aim to dismantle parts of President Barack Obama's legacy. Trump is also looking to use international relations in pursuit of economic ends, even as some observers worry his approach is based on misperceptions of economic forces.  \n\nSome analysts point to the possibility that Trump is taking a deeply strategic approach; others say he simply fails to understand the crucial importance of long-standing US alliances. At the least, it is an approach that contrasts with Obama, who has tried to find areas of common interest with China to bridge serious divides. At the same time, he has endeavored, with little success, to isolate Russia for a series of international violations.\n\n\"It's a sign of confusion if you're making trouble with the Chinese at the same time as you're making trouble with US allies in Asia, and it's a sign of confusion if you're trying to make up with Russia at the same that you're not tending to American alliances in Europe,\" said Steven Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nTrump \"acts like a guy who thinks he can make everybody mad at the same time and not pay a price for it,\" Sestanovich said. \n\nRussia has conducted a stealth invasion of Ukraine, annexed Crimea -- the first attempt to alter European borders by force since World War II -- and is believed to have supplied the missile that brought down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, shot down over Ukraine in 2014.\n\nMoscow has supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war, including in the bombing of civilians in Aleppo, in direct opposition to the US. The Russian military has buzzed US aircraft and ships. And the US intelligence community found with \"high confidence\" that Russia was behind hacking during the presidential election campaign meant to sow doubts about American democracy. \n\nAnd yet Trump speaks warmly of Putin and his desire for better cooperation with Russia, publicly dismissing the hacking allegations and accusing the intelligence community of acting politically.\n\nThat stand has damaged morale within the intelligence community and puzzled observers who wonder whether it's a strategic decision or a function of Trump's admiration for authoritarian figures, possible business deals with Russian oligarchs, or as-yet-undiscovered links or financial debts. Russian officials have said they were in contact with the Trump campaign throughout the election. \n\nRELATED: Trump attacks set intelligence community on edge\n\nMatt Rojansky, head of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center, said one reason could be Trump's belief that the US should do more work with Russia to defeat terrorism and his view of that challenge as a \"civilizational battle between radical Islam and, broadly speaking, the forces of Western civilization.\"\n\nTrump and his aides, particularly his future national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, are much more comfortable including Russia under the \"Western civilization\" umbrella than prominent Republicans such as Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Rojansky said. That will cause friction, possibly sooner rather than later.\n\nMcCain will hold hearings Thursday to examine Russia's role in the election hacking. The Arizona senator and Graham have announced that they will also lead new sanctions against Russia. McCain already is working on legislation with the leading Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin.\n\nIf Trump's stance on Russia might fray some of his alliances in Congress, he's already put European allies on edge with his warmth toward Putin and questions about the worth of NATO. He's also unnerved Asian allies by questioning the cost of helping Japan and South Korea defend themselves. \n\n\"I can see why it's a temptation for a big shot like Trump to think that smaller powers don't matter and you just solve your problems with the other big guys,\" said Sestanovich, who is also a professor at Columbia University. \"That's just a mistake. The other guys are going to eat your lunch if you have let American alliance ties wither. I think that's what he doesn't get.\" \n\nHe said that, \"The biggest lever we have with the Chinese is our network of alliances, similarly with the Russians.\"\n\nSome analysts have suggested Trump is practicing a sophisticated version of the \"triangular diplomacy\" former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and President Richard Nixon used to play the Soviet Union and China off against each other in the 1970s. \n\nBut the two nations are no longer bitter enemies and instead have a well-defined, if mutually wary, relationship.\n\n\"There's no way by improving relations with Russia you get a significant bang for your buck with the Chinese,\" Sestanovich said.\n\nChina, like Russia, has targeted the US with cyberattacks. Beijing has pushed US companies in China to give up proprietary technology, it has contested US claims to freedom of navigation through Asian waters, its military has buzzed US naval vessels and Air Force jets, and it recently stole a US underwater drone. \n\nIf Trump seems to look the other way on Russian transgressions, China gets no free pass.\n\nThe President-elect, who manufactures parts of his clothing line in China, often charges that Beijing steals American jobs with unfair trade practices. \"China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!\" he tweeted Monday. Soon after winning the presidency, he antagonized Beijing by holding a phone conversation with Taiwan's leader.\n\nTrump has long made China a bogeyman, accusing it in a 2012 tweet of having \"created\" the concept of global warming in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive. He has particularly fixated on China's economic practices, blasting it on trade and currency throughout the presidential race and blaming it for the loss of American jobs. Trade and job losses were central rallying cries of his campaign.\n\nRELATED: Donald Trump's fight with America's spies\n\nRichard Bush, director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, said Trump's criticisms reflect a lack of understanding about international economics. \"The jobs China is accused of stealing, many were lost a long time ago to Korea or Japan and moved from there to China,\" he said. \"A lot of that job loss occurred because of technology change,\" he said. \n\nAnd despite Trump's promises to bring jobs back to the US, Bush said, \"Nobody in the US would do them at the wages companies would want to charge. Those jobs are never going to be gotten back.\"\n\nBush also pointed out that there are limits to how much any US president can change relations with China. \"Will the American business community sit idly by and watch Trump undertake a trade war with China? They have a lot at stake in this,\" he said. \n\nIn the meantime, Trump's stream of anti-Chinese Tweets poses risks, he said.\n\nWhile Trump might be trying to create bargaining positions or exert pressure, his tweets might be misunderstood, Bush said, creating the chance that \"China would regard a potential challenge as more dangerous than it actually might be.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.28113341331482, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1237, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.3775812419299998, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105110000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.02101859337106, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/opinions/lessons-of-trump-voters-peniel-joseph/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "The lessons to learn from Trump voters", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1021, "date": "20161107140000", "story_content": "Supporters of either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton view America as a Rorschach test, one wherein the same image elicits wildly contrasting depictions of the state of the nation, the health of our republic and the beating heart of democracy. Clinton's multiracial groups of supporters are attempting to maintain and grow the Obama Coalition, an unprecedentedly racially diverse group of voters that twice elected Barack Obama to the White House.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump campaign's overt hostility to the very idea of racial equality or diversity has inspired outrage, hand wringing, and disgust, not the least of which has emanated from Clinton herself, who famously characterized at least a portion of Trump's supporters as a \"basket of deplorables.\" These Trump supporters, overwhelming white, male and working-class, have taken the brunt of criticism from both liberals and conservatives, who have been appalled, for admittedly different reasons, by the boorish behavior on display at political rallies teeming with an edge of racial violence, overt misogyny and anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim fervor.  Violence, in the form of bullying female journalists, threatening Clinton with indictment, jail, impeachment and assassination and physical assaults on anti-Trump protesters have become a hallmark of this mean political season. \n\n But these details, the foundation of so much criticism and conversation for weeks and months, obscure an important reality. Portrayals of the majority of Trump voters as a part of a misbegotten white working class -- dreaming of a return to Eisenhower America's competitive advantage over the rest of the world, with benefits disproportionately doled out to white men with relatively little education -- have obscured the larger story of this election season: the fact that many quiet supporters of the Republican presidential nominee have very little in common with the working class caricatures most often featured in the national press. Almost half of Trump voters in the Republican primaries had college degrees, for instance. \n\nIt's a convenient assumption that Trump's brand of bigotry primarily appealed to uneducated whites living in racially segregated rural areas -- swaths of post-industrial sections of the Midwest that became casualties of the shift from smokestack and factory labor to a globalized economy that values highly educated engineers more than steel workers. But it isn't true.\n\nOne part of the narrative is true, however. Trump's support has been overwhelmingly white, with blacks polling in the single digits and Latinos in the 20s.  It is also true that white men and women without college degrees overwhelmingly favor Trump. Yet one third of white women with college degrees and 40% of college-educated white men also support the candidate whose \"Make America Great Again\" tagline has evolved into as much of a threat as a campaign slogan.   And while rural voters are positively euphoric in support of the real estate magnate, the suburban electorate is not far behind: 44% of them expressing support, along with 28% of urban voters.\n\nWhat are we to make of this large and diverse group of white voters expressing support for a candidate many critics have derided as nothing less than a prophet of hate and division whose campaign has threatened to rend the very fabric of the republic?\n\nWhether Trump wins or loses, at least three observations are important to make. These lessons, derived more from the behavior of the \"quiet\" Trump voter than from those whose angry bluster fills the airwaves, teach us important lessons about ourselves as a country, ones that we would do well not to ignore in the months and years to come \n\nFirst, Trump's campaign tapped into political furies that transcend a single political cycle and go beyond one slice of the American electorate. His campaign has galvanized diverse groups of millions of white Americans, from a range of educational, geographic and economic circumstances and backgrounds. Many of them were drawn to his criticism of Washington corruption, his caustic attacks on Hillary Clinton and his bombastic \"tell it like it is\" denigration of our nation's racial, ethnic and religious diversity.  For these voters, Trump is not so much an anachronistic ghost of a racist past as a truth-teller, unafraid of being politically incorrect.\n\nSecond, the \"lesser of two evils\" argument is not a compelling enough reason to inspire millions of Americans to be politically engaged.  Hillary Clinton's long history of public service deserves substantive praise and criticism, yet the public narrative shaped by right wing critics, mainstream media and the candidate's own numerous unforced errors (and occasional egregious mistakes) obscured this understanding of Clinton as a politician and a person.  While Trump basked in his role as a purveyor of innuendo and master of chaos, Clinton remained too often a distant figure, unable to emotionally connect with many of the very constituencies she claimed to be passionately fighting for.\n\nThird, and most crucially, race matters. A lot. Trump's candidacy played on on the double-consciousness of racial anxiety in American society. On one side, we have the historic fear, demonization and criminalization of black bodies, reflected in Trump's repeated use of the coded phrases \"Chicago,\" \"law and order\" and \"inner city\": metaphors meant to imply a coming racial apocalypse. Equally important, Trump capitalized on white economic anxiety across the board, realizing in a way that the neo-liberals in Washington have not, the marginalization of college-educated and white working class in an economy whose benefits have been overwhelmingly hoarded by the less than 1%.\n\n If \"Black Lives Matter\" captured the zeitgeist of grassroots movements for racial and economic justice in the Age of Obama, \"Make America Great Again\" uncovered the rage, anxiety, and bitterness of white Americans gripped by fears of declining economic mobility, fatigued by national discussion of police shootings of blacks and unsure of whom to blame.  In a world where blacks and whites increasingly live, go to school, work and die in segregated communities, worlds apart, this was perhaps the easiest part of Trump's rise.\n\nFor better or worse, the reverberations of millions of white voters' support for a Trump candidacy will continue for American democracy, long after next Tuesday's election. We ignore the consequences of these impulses at the peril of both our national character and political destiny.

And he is right that many Americans believe their capital to be inundated with lobbyists, campaign contributors and influence peddlers. But to reform Washington, Trump will have to address conflicts of interest that are already apparent in his transition team. Unless these problems are fixed, his administration will have little credibility in ethics by the time he reaches the White House -- and that will mean reform of the rest of Washington will be very difficult.\n\nMost of the incoming administration's potential conflicts of interest stem from Trump's own multibillion-dollar real estate empire. He could sell these holdings, or put them in one or more holding companies and then sell shares in those companies for cash. (Wall Street investment bankers would be more than happy to help him with this.) He could then invest the sale proceeds in conflict-free assets such as mutual funds and treasury bonds, or put the proceeds in a blind trust.   \n\nBut he apparently does not want to do that. He says that he instead will turn management of these companies over to his adult children during the time he is President, presumably while he continues to own them. Yet that simply will not work from a conflict of interest vantage point -- every time his administration does anything that appears to help one of these businesses, Trump will be accused of enriching himself at the expense of the public.  \n\nPerhaps the most important conflict is not what Trump owns, but what he and his businesses owe. The Trump real estate empire and others like it thrive on borrowed money. Easy money would likely be the rule for bank lenders seeking to appease a powerful president, and he could reciprocate by loosely regulating the banks. (He has already talked of repealing all or part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking reform law.)   \n\nLoose regulation of banks leads to easy lending and rising real estate prices, which enrich bankers and real estate moguls. But we know from past experience that the party does not last forever. When the bubble bursts -- as it did in the 1990s and again in 2008 -- ordinary Americans are crushed in the downturn while clever bankers and real estate investors (particularly those with inside information about government policy) bail out ahead of time.\n\nThen there are the multitude of foreign policy questions that will arise in countries where the Trump business empire has holdings. \n\nIn countries where the United States appeases a foreign dictator or negotiates a bad trade agreement, the President's critics will look for a Trump hotel or casino. Or perhaps there will be a building owned in part by a sovereign wealth fund and bearing the Trump name under a licensing agreement. Or a bank loan from a government-owned bank such as the Bank of China, from which The New York Times reported that Trump businesses took out at least one large loan. These latter two scenarios, and any other scenario involving transactions with foreign government-owned entities, also could violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits any government official, including the president, from taking payments from foreign governments without the consent of Congress.\n\nYet another problem is the unclear involvement of the President-elect's children in his transition team. As President he will not be able to appoint his children or in-laws to any government job under the anti-nepotism statute passed by Congress after President John F. Kennedy appointed his brother to be attorney general. \n\nTrump's wife and children could of course give him informal advice without holding a government position. Hillary Clinton did just that for President Bill Clinton when he delegated his health care proposal to her in 1993-94. But now, as then, there will be political backlash if the President overreaches in circumventing the anti-nepotism statute.  \n\nAnd Trump's children have one big conflict of interest that first lady Hillary Clinton did not have -- Trump has already said his children will be running the billion-dollar Trump business empire. If he has any plans to separate his business empire from his administration, his children should have nothing to do with the transition team now, and they should have nothing to do with the official work of the White House after he becomes President. \n\nAmericans have a right to a president who not only avoids corruption by personal conflict of interest but the appearance of corruption. This is true even if Trump ignored any self-interest in making all of his decisions, and even if he were to order his subordinates to do the same. \n\nUS law requires every other employee of the executive branch, except the president and vice president, to sell assets that create conflicts with official duties or to recuse themselves from all government matters that affect those financial interests. Every other president has voluntarily complied with this law, even though not legally required to do so. Trump owes it to the American people to do the same.  Only then will he be credible in telling the rest of Washington how to behave.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.2889366149902302, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 863, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.73936712242, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161116210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 6, "pct_mft_words": 3.01274623406721, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/04/middleeast/mosul-offensive-iraq/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 791, "scraper_regex": 867}}, "headline": "ISIS seizing boys as young as 9 to fight in Mosul, UN warns", "wordcount_as_scraped": 867, "date": "20161104180000", "story_content": "As Iraqi troops waged fierce battles Friday with ISIS militants in Mosul's eastern neighborhoods, the United Nations warned it believes the terror group is seizing boys as young as 9 to fight on its behalf.\n\nIt has received reports ISIS has been instructing residents of Hammam al-Alil, about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) south of Mosul, to hand over boys 9 and older since October 17, Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency, said at press briefing in Geneva, Switzerland. \n\nShe said the boys were apparently being conscripted to fight on behalf of the terror group as it battles to hold on to its Iraqi stronghold in the face of a massive assault by Iraqi-led coalition forces.\n\nShamdasani said the United Nations continued to receive reports of mass killings by ISIS, including 50 of its own militants Monday at Mosul's Ghazlani military base for alleged desertion. \n\nIraqi troops are engaged in furious battles with militants to liberate the easternmost neighborhoods of Mosul after they breached the city limits for the first time in two years.\n\nThese forces have started storming the neighborhoods of al-Karama, al-Zahra, al-Qudes and al-Tahrir, Maj.

It also witnessed Iraqi Humvees racing toward neighborhoods in eastern Mosul.\n\nMilitary radio chatter suggested that rooftop snipers, along with militants firing from civilian areas, were complicating the fight. \n\nThe Iraqi army has reported progress on the northern front, with the capture of areas near Tal Kayf. \n\nHowever, Iraqi counterterror troops got an early taste of how dogged -- and bloody -- ISIS' defense of the city will be after encountering what one soldier described as \"crazy resistance.\"\n\nThree of the unit's soldiers were killed and seven wounded inside the neighborhood of Kirkokli. \n\nSoldier with counter-terror forces manning a sniper rifle observing#ISIS activity at the frontline on the outskirts of #Mosul. pic.twitter.com/HSEuMIJ8YV\u2014 Hamdi (@HamdiAlkhshali) November 4, 2016\n\nThe unit was met by two suicide vehicle bombs, and ISIS fighters emerged at close quarters with heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The unit lost two Humvees, with damage to three others.\n\nIraqi military helicopters circled above the area, using heavy machine gun fire against suspected ISIS positions.\n\nISIS-launched mortars landed on residential areas, killing at least seven civilians. \n\nCivilians continue to leave neighborhoods on the outskirts of Mosul despite efforts by Iraqi authorities to keep them in their homes. Many said it had become impossible to stay because there was no water or food. \n\nOfficials have warned that entering the city would likely trigger the fiercest fighting yet and that the battle is expected to be fought street to street, or even house to house. \n\nMore human shields? \n\nOne challenge the liberators are facing is differentiating ISIS fighters from civilians. The terror group is reported to have brought tens of thousands of civilians -- mostly women and children -- into the city to be used as human shields, a tactic to ward off airstrikes and ground assaults. \n\nOn Thursday night, ISIS militants ordered civilians to leave the town of Hammam al-Alil and head north into Mosul.  The order via the loudspeakers of mosques came after the Iraqi military announced its troops had reached hills overlooking the town.\n\n'New life breathed into us'\n\nAs forces broke through Mosul's border, the Iraqi army opened up a safe route for civilians to evacuate from the front line in al Intisar, Brig. Gen. Tahsin Ibrahim, an Iraqi Ministry of Defense spokesman, told CNN.\n\nA CNN team on the ground saw hundreds fleeing on foot from the direction of Mosul and the village of Gogjali on the outskirts, risking ISIS' booby traps and gunfire. Many waved white flags to show they were civilians. \n\nPeople fleeing intensified fighting in #Mosul head for IDP camps along the main highway from #Nneveh to #Kurdistan. #Iraq #ISIS pic.twitter.com/cvucw6nQYh\u2014 Moni Basu (@MbasuCNN) November 3, 2016\n\nThey gathered on the side of a road where the Iraqi military sent trucks and buses to pick them up and take them to a camp in the town of Khazir.

Four children were among the dead in Tadaf.\n\nAbdulrahman told CNN the death toll is expected to rise as many remain in critical condition. The SOHR could not confirm whether the warplanes were Russian or Turkish. \n\nThe SOHR said regime forces faced strong resistance from Islamic militants near the Damascus suburb of Wadi Barada.\n\n  \n\nMore than 20 airstrikes were reported near Wadi Barada since Friday morning as militants repelled regime forces trying to advance on the suburb, activist Abu Mohammad al-Bardawi in Wadi Barada told CNN. The area is home to a major water spring that supplies Damascus.  \n\nCNN could not independently verify the reports of renewed violence on Friday. \n\nSOHR also said government warplanes conducted more than a dozen strikes in northern Hama province Friday, which houses pockets of ISIS militants.\n\nAdditionally, activists in the city of Douma, about 6 miles from Damascus, reported shelling by regime forces.\n\nNo violence reported by Syrian, Russian media \n\nNeither SANA nor Russian state media has reported episodes of violence Friday morning. \n\n\"I heard no skirmishes or shelling over the last 12 hours,\" Ahmad Khabir, a resident of Idlib told CNN. \n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, speaking after Friday prayers in the capital of Ankara, said he hoped the ceasefire leads to \"a sustainable peace that would prevent further bloodshed and the killing of civilians, innocents and children.\" \n\nOn Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the agreement in which the Syrian government and opposition rebels would cease fighting in the country's long-running civil war. Putin described the agreement as \"very fragile\" and said it demanded \"special attention and patience.\"\n\n \n\nThe brutal civil war has raged on for nearly six years and killed an estimated 400,000 people. \n\nPeace talks scheduled in Kazakhstan\n\nPutin said the two sides agreed to enter peace talks to end the conflict, according to the Russian state-run TASS news agency. Three documents had been signed, Putin said: the ceasefire agreement, a package of measures to oversee the ceasefire and a declaration of readiness to enter into peace talks. \n\nThose peace talks are to be held in Astana, Kazakhstan, in what Putin and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad described as \"an important step for a final solution of the crisis,\" according to a statement by the Kremlin. \n\nPutin and Assad had discussed the agreement by phone Thursday, with the Syrian President saying he would comply with the ceasefire, according to the Kremlin statement.\n\nTurkey and Russia are guarantors to the agreement.\n\nBut groups considered as terror organizations by the UN Security Council, such as ISIS, are excluded from the agreement, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. \n\nThe upper hand\n\nThe latest effort comes after previous ceasefire attempts by the international community crumbled. \n\nIt also follows several ceasefire agreements brokered by Turkey and Russia in the city of Aleppo this month. Most were broken, but one held long enough to allow the evacuations of tens of thousands of rebels and civilians from eastern Aleppo.\n\nEastern Aleppo had been under rebel control for four years and had been choked off by the Syrian regime, leading to shortages of food and supplies for civilians. \n\nThe Syrian regime then gained full control of Aleppo, a major turning point that has limited the opposition's military and political options. \n\n\"We've had these rebel reverses, the loss of Aleppo -- a victory by the Syrian regime,\"  said CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona. \n\n\"So I think that the rebels are looking at this as maybe their last chance, and they may actually want this ceasefire to work. ... But their hand is really weak right now.\"\n\nWill ceasefire hold?\n\nA successful nationwide ceasefire hinges on many fighting factions laying down arms. Groups from Iraq, Iran and Lebanon are also fighting alongside the forces of Assad. \n\nThe legal adviser for the Turkish-backed rebel Free Syrian Army, Osama Abu Zeid, called the agreement \"a complete truce with no exceptions or preconditions\" that included \"all areas and military factions in Syrian opposition territory.\" \n\n\"The main goal is improving the living conditions for Syrian citizens,\" he said.\n\n\"Our message to the Syrian population (is) that our fingers will remain on the trigger, and we will present all sacrifices and we will take every path that will alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people.\" \n\nNot all opposition groups have signed the latest ceasefire, though. The Syrian rebel group Ahrar al-Sham is one of them. \n\n\"Ahrar al-Sham has a number of reservations over the proposed agreement and the negotiations,\" spokesman Ahmad Qura Ali said on Twitter. \"We will make clear our reservations in due course.\"\n\nWhere is the US?\n\nTurkey and Russia appear to be sidelining the United States and driving what had been a UN-led political process. \n\nThroughout the Syrian war, the UN Security Council has been widely criticized for failing to find a solution. Russia has played a role in that, as it used its veto power to reject several resolutions on the conflict. \n\nA spokesperson for UN Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura welcomed the ceasefire in a statement.\n\nUS State Department spokesman Mark Toner acknowledged that Washington was not part of the negotiations but said the agreement was \"a positive development.\"\n\nThe US has led an international coalition to fight ISIS in Syria and has vehemently opposed any attempt to keep Assad in power.\n\nAlthough Russia and Turkey brokered the agreement, the two countries have differed in their stance on Assad, whose family has ruled Syria for four decades. \n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last month that Turkish forces entered Syria to help end Assad's rule. Meanwhile, Russia is Assad's most powerful ally and has propped up his regime since September 2015 with airstrikes.\n\nPutin said Russia would begin scaling back its military presence in Syria, though it would continue to support the \"legitimate Syrian government in its struggle with terrorism.\"\n\nThe Syrian regime has frequently referred to opposition fighters as \"terrorists,\" long before ISIS gained a foothold in the country.

Millions of children out of school. \n\nAnd now, in Aleppo, Syrian forces, backed by Iranian-supported militias and Russian strikes, appear poised to recapture the city which had been split in two for more than three years.\n\nThe city that was the country's most populous before the devastation of the civil war.\n\nSiege, starvation and the reported execution of civilians in plain sight.\n\nThe UN says it has \"reliable evidence that in four areas 82 civilians were killed, adding that many more may have died.\"\n\nRubble everywhere and safety nowhere  \n\nAnd how has the international community responded?  They have talked, spread blame and talked some more. The United Nations on Tuesday found itself home to yet another diplomatic standoff in the face of Aleppo's downfall, this time with sharp words for Syria, Russia and Iran from the US Ambassador to the UN.\n\n\"Your forces and your proxies are carrying out these crimes.

As they face further shelling, diplomats discuss a ceasefire that may or not may not take hold. \n\n'Never again'?\n\n\"The words 'never again' ring hollow today with reports that Aleppo is falling to Assad regime forces,\" Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a statement. \n\n\"For four long years, Aleppo has been at the center of the Assad regime's war on the Syrian people ... Together with its Russian and Iranian allies, the Assad regime has relentlessly targeted women and children, doctors and rescue workers, hospitals and bakeries, aid warehouses and humanitarian convoys.\"\n\nThat \"responsibility to protect\" has been shown to be three words that mean precious little. \n\nRest in peace, R2P. It ended before it even really began.\n\nSyria is the war that has run out of adjectives.

We did not elect King Trump.\"\n\nAs Trump's inauguration approaches, there has been widespread handwringing among undocumented immigrants and their advocates as they wait to see how US immigration policy may change under a Trump administration. But there is mounting evidence that whatever actions he takes will not match the harsh rhetoric of the campaign trail.\n\nWhat the immigration battle could look like under Trump\n\nHe's already waffled on his promise to build a wall, saying that existing fencing may suffice in some sections of the border. His controversial pledge of a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the US seems all but forgotten. \n\nThat leaves the deportation pledge.\n\n\"Mr. Trump will not be able or willing to engage in the kind of mass deportations that he promised in his campaign,\" said Stephen Legomsky, a professor emeritus at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.\n\n'More difficult than it sounds'\n\n\"Simply finding large numbers of undocumented immigrants with criminal records is much more difficult than it sounds,\" said Legomsky, who served as former chief counsel to US Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013 and as a senior counselor to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2015.\n\nLegomsky, who has since left government, said any such effort would be \"incredibly laborious\" and cost prohibitive.\n\nEarly in the presidential campaign, Trump said all 11 million illegal immigrants in the US should be deported. He seemed to soften his stance after the election, telling CBS' \"60 Minutes\" that he would prioritize going after undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes beyond being in the country illegally.\n\nThe irony of that approach, experts say, is that it would be much easier for Trump to locate and begin deportation proceedings of non-criminals such as those granted temporary amnesty under President Barack Obama's Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals Program.\n\nThe program, known as DACA, granted some 840,000 childhood-arrivals to the US temporary protection from deportation and issued them work permits. It was created by executive memorandum in 2012 and could be immediately rescinded by the Trump administration, stripping DACA participants of their protection against deportation.\n\nCalifornia Dems tap Eric Holder to fight Trump in court\n\nGoing after undocumented immigrants with criminal records could prove more difficult and would likely require congressional approval to pay for more Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to round up potential deportees who do not want to be found.\n\nKey to that effort would be the cooperation of local law enforcement who run county jails and have the ability to alert ICE agents to the presence of undocumented immigrants with criminal records in their custody. Such inmates can be placed on an ICE \"detainer\" indicating that they are to be handed over to immigration officials when they finish their sentences. This could provide a steady flow of potential deportees without having to conduct costly and time-consuming searches.\n\nBut many big cities with large undocumented immigrant populations have said they would refuse to cooperate with such deportations under most circumstances. Some cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, have set up legal defense funds for undocumented immigrants facing deportation.\n\nTrump's threat\n\nTrump has threatened to withhold federal funding from cities that don't cooperate with US immigration efforts -- an approach that could cripple local schools, police departments and airports, among others.\n\nBut Chishti predicted any such effort would face an immediate legal challenge. He said there were several Supreme Court cases that stood for the proposition that the federal government can't indiscriminately \"hold a gun to the states' head.\"\n\nA threat to withhold funds, he said, \"must be in relation to the dispute at hand.\"\n\nEven if officials were able to initiate a surge in deportation cases, such an effort would likely stall in immigration court where there is currently a backlog of more than a half million cases and a wait time of nearly two years.\n\nMark Krikorian, executive director of the Center For Immigration Studies, a non-partisan think tank in Washington, said Trump's campaign pledges to deport millions amounted to an \"Archie Bunker moment\" that should not have been taken seriously.\n\nWho's in Trump's Cabinet?\n\n\"He's not going to be snapping his fingers and deporting millions of people over night,\" said Krikorain, whose group's motto is \"Low-Immigration, pro-immigrant.\"\n\n\"That's not realistic,\" Krikorian said. \"No one thinks that's going to happen.\"\n\nBut Krikorian said \"it's very plausible\" that Trump could ramp up deportations by 25% or more in 2017 and return to levels seen under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, which he said reached about 400,000 a year when Bush left office.\n\nThat, he said, could be done without significant budgetary increases and despite resistance from sanctuary cities.\n\n\"I think the other side is making it seem more complicated than it needs to be,\" he said.\n\nStephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School, agreed that Trump would be able to have meaningful impact during the first year of his presidency, but not to the extent suggested during the campaign.\n\n\"On the campaign trail things are not nuanced. They're black and white,\" Yale-Loehr said. \"It takes a while to turn the battleship of bureaucracy around.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.3719010353088406, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 888, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.75246982529, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 20, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 44, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.9549549549549505, "mft_mean": 4.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/natalie-jaresko-axe-files/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 698, "scraper_regex": 414}}, "headline": "Former Ukraine finance minister: Russia wants to upend Western democracy", "wordcount_as_scraped": 414, "date": "20170130120000", "story_content": "The Axe Files, featuring David Axelrod, is a podcast distributed by CNN and produced at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.

If confirmed, Price could play an outsized role in efforts to roll back major parts of the law -- a top legislative priority for Republicans under the Trump administration. \n\nBut while Price fielded plenty of questions Wednesday about his views on reforming the health care system, it was his actions as an investor that sparked the tensest exchanges and seemed at times to leave the veteran lawmaker flustered. \n\nRight off the bat, Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Health Committee, grilled Price on whether he purchased stocks in a company called Innate Immunotherapeutics after receiving a \"stock tip\" from a fellow member of the House, GOP Rep. Chris Collins. \n\n\"Do you believe it is appropriate for a senior member of Congress, actively involved in policymaking in the health center, to repeatedly personally invest in a drug company that could benefit from those actions?\" Murray asked. \n\n\"That's not what happened,\" said Price, who insisted repeatedly that he never received information that could be considered stock tip. \n\nMurray shot back: \"I believe it's inappropriate. And we need answers to this.\"\n\nLater in the hearing, Price also said he has \"no idea\" what stocks he owns when Sen. Al Franken brought up congressman's prior holdings in tobacco companies.\n\n\"How do you square reaping personal financial gains from sales of an addictive product that kills millions of Americans every decade with also voting against measures to reduce the death toll inflicted by tobacco?\" Franken asked. \n\nThe question was among the most antagonistic and personally hitting for Price, who had said earlier that his father had been a \"Lucky Strike smoker from World War II\" who died from emphysema.\n\n\"I have no idea what stocks I held in the '90s or the 2000s or even now,\" Price said. \"All of these decisions for all of us I suspect, are through mutual funds and through pension funds.\"\n\nOne specific ethics concern raised during the hearing was Price's investment last year in a medical device manufacturer called Zimmer Biomet. CNN reported on Monday that after buying shares in the company, Price introduced legislation that would have directed benefited the firm. \n\nDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said it was hard to believe that Price's broker was simply someone \"you pay to handle the paperwork.\"\n\n\"This is someone who buys stock at your direction. This is someone who buys and sells the stocks you want them to buy and sell,\" Warren said. \n\n\"Not true. That's not true senator,\" Price responded. \n\n\"Just because you decide not to tell them? Wink, wink, nod, nod and we're all just supposed to believe that?\"\n\nWhen Warren pressed Price further on whether he took deliberate action as a lawmaker to help the company, Price shot back that he was \"offended by the insinuation.\"\n\nBut while Price said he didn't know what stocks he previously owned, he maintained that he has divulged his and his wife's holdings every year and has updated it if there were any changes.\n\n\"There isn't a single bit of information that's out here that I didn't reveal to the public in a transparent process,\" he said. \n\nEthics office role\n\nPrice also praised the Office of Government Ethics and the \"diligence\" of its review of cabinet nominees' holdings and assets. He noted that the office puts very specific recommendations online that the public can review.\n\n\"We have agreed to every single recommendation that they've made to divest of whatever holdings we have that might even give the appearance of a possible conflict,\" Price said.\n\nPrice was likely referring to the fact that Zimmer Biomet Holdings is listed in his financial disclosure and his ethics agreement as an asset for him to divest if confirmed to run HHS. \n\nThe Office of Government Ethics, however, is tasked with reviewing Price's potential conflicts for his administration post, not his previous conduct.\n\n\"The Office of Government ethics reviews his current situation for potential conflicts of interest and negotiates an agreement with how he should handle (divestment) in the future,\" Larry Noble, general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said about Price's testimony. \"It does not look at his past activity.\"\n\nThe ethics office also weighed, sending out a series of tweets soon after Price's testimony and clarifying its role:\n\n\"OGE oversees the executive branch #ethics program, while Congress & the Courts have their own ethics programs....\n\nOGE does not handle complaints of misconduct. Please learn where & how to report #fed employee misconduct,\" the agency wrote.\n\nObamacare repeal\n\nPrice, expected to be a key player in the GOP's effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, said Trump and Republicans must reassure the American people that \"Nobody's interested in pulling the rug out from under anybody.\"\n\n\"We believe that it's absolutely imperative that individuals that have healthcare be able to keep health coverage and move hopefully to greater choices and opportunities for them to gain the kind of coverage that they want,\" Price said. \"There's been a lot of talk about individuals losing health coverage. That is not our goal, nor is it our desire nor is it our plan.\"\n\nAsked by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, chairman of the health committee, about Trump's recent comments that repeal and replace should happen simultaneously, Price said he believes \"that's fair.\"\n\nPrice, however, has been kept out of the loop on Trump's Obamacare proposal so that he doesn't have to answer questions about the specifics of that plan, according to a Trump transition official.\n\nIn his opening statement, Price emphasized his upbringing and professional background, including his 20 years as a practicing physician that he said helped him learn about \"not just treating patients but about he broader health care system and where it intersects with government.\" \n\nBut he did not mention his legislation to undo Obamacare during those introductory remarks, speaking instead in broad strokes about the country's health care system. Price said he believes in these six principles of health care: \"Affordability, accessibility, quality, responsiveness, innovation and choices.\"\n\nGOP Sen. Orrin Hatch, along with other Republican senators, strongly defended his fellow lawmaker. Hatch called the accusations leveled against Price \"nothing more than a hypocritical attack on your good character. And I personally resent it.\"\n\nThis will be the first of two hearings for Price. He will also face the Senate Finance Committee on January 24.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.31847134232521096, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 584, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.63793056883, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.08219178082192, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/14/health/teen-suicide-cyberbullying-continues-trnd/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 625, "scraper_regex": 658}}, "headline": "Teen who shot herself in front of her parents is still being bullied", "wordcount_as_scraped": 658, "date": "20161215010000", "story_content": "Raul Vela, who watched his daughter die two weeks ago, doesn't want peace or quiet. He wants action. \n\nBrandy Vela, 18, shot herself in front of her parents after being relentlessly cyberbullied. The Texas teen, who was described by her school as well-liked and friendly, was buried December 7. By Friday, someone had opened a social media page in her memory, but it was quickly filled with disturbing posts about her; the cyberbullying literally following her to the grave. \n\nHer father is fighting back.\n\n\"The continued harassment reported by Mr. Vela is being investigated,\" Texas City police Capt. Joe Stanton said. \"We currently do not have any suspects or persons of interest identified.\"\n\nThe harassment continues\n\n\"Two days after her funeral, somebody opened up a social media page in her name,\" Vela said, \"and people thought the family did it, so it started with people putting sincere condolences. After a few minutes, either four people or the same person posting four times said some things harassing Brandy about being a big fat cow, writing 'you finally did it' with a picture of a gun, writing 'you're a coward,' 'you should have done this a long time ago,' some really horrific things.\"\n\nThe Vela family provided screenshots of the posts, but CNN is not publishing them because of their offensive nature. \n\nOne of the posts shows a smiling Brandy with the words \"my face when you shoot yourself in front of your family.\" Another is a stick figure holding a gun with the words, \"oops am I dead?\" A third shows a gun hidden inside a book. \n\n\"People are more likely to write horrible things when they think they're being anonymous,\" said psychologist Susan Swearer, co-founder of the Bullying Research Network. \"From a psychological perspective, people who write horrible things about other people, particularly after they've passed away, they have their own mental health issues.\"\n\nShe says Vela did the right thing by reporting the social media pages to authorities.\n\n\"When people feel emboldened to write mean and hurtful things about other people, they'll just extend it to siblings or families,\" Swearer said.\n\nVela, whose family was avoiding social media in the wake of Brandy's death, said the posts were first brought to their attention by friends. \n\nShortly after the news of Brandy's death broke, people also began attacking Vela online, he said. \n\n\"People were putting comments about me saying that I should have done something different, so I blocked it all. I'm not reading it anymore,\" he said. \n\n\"They're still harassing her, but she's no longer with us, so it's more like they're harassing me and my family.\"\n\nPolice have told the Velas that they'll be able to trace the posts, and the culprits will be prosecuted. \n\nRaising awareness \n\nVela can't change what happened to his daughter, so he's trying to persuade state lawmakers to increase restrictions on social media, making it harder for cyberbullies to stay anonymous.\n\nHe met with local legislators and community representatives and says they came up with good ideas, such as providing specialized counseling and mental health support at schools for victims like his daughter. \n\n\"Right now, my job is to raise awareness. I'm not trying to blame people or point fingers. I want people who are still being bullied to know that I want to change things. I feel like she put this in my hands to try and get help for people in the same situation. It's unfortunate that something tragic has to happen to make changes come,\" Vela said. \n\nHe said he wants every police department in the nation to have at least one officer trained to pursue cyberbullying crimes. He called Brandy's death a murder, saying she was pushed to the breaking point. \n\n\"I feel like these people are cowards, these people hiding behind the texts and fake pages. They're the ones who pushed her to this point. She lost all her self-esteem, lost all her self-worth,\" he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.37317800521851, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 625, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.2599641626599998, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.24, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/22/europe/russia-us-relations-frozen/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 547, "scraper_regex": 588}}, "headline": "Russia gives US cold shoulder, saying relations between countries 'frozen' ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 588, "date": "20161222150000", "story_content": "The frosty relationship between the United States and Russia has become even more icy after Moscow said communications between the countries were at the bare minimum.\n\n\"Nearly all levels of our dialogue (with the US) has been frozen,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview Wednesday with Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti.\n\n\"We do not talk to each other.

It's also where his ashes will be delivered to a final resting place on Sunday. \n\nA 550-mile, cross-country funeral procession this week traced, in reverse, the triumphant 1959 march of Castro's ragtag guerillas from Santiago to Havana nearly six decades earlier.\n\nCadet, 73, in 1961 made the journey to the capital in the early stages of El Comandante's socialist experiment.\n\nIn Havana, she gave birth in 1964 to her first child, Manuel, who is now 52. She lives with him in a run-down concrete house next door to her granddaughter, Fatima, a 20-year-old University of Havana student.   \n\nEven within their close-knit family, the wide rifts created by Castro's long domination over this island of 11 million endure. \n\nIn the days after the Cuban leader's demise at age 90 one week ago, Cadet, her son and granddaughter reflected on Castro's reign and his revolution. \n\nFor many in the older generations, it is a time of grief and sorrow. Castro was like a father to them, an almost mythical figure who shepherded the island through conflict and despair.\n\nLarge swaths of the younger generations, however, are indifferent to his passing. Castro has been out of the picture most of their lives. They never sat through his hourslong speeches.\n\nThey surf the internet. They own smartphones. They chat with friends abroad on Skype. The all-consuming political battles that marked life in the time of Castro don't matter to them.\n\nCadet, old and frail, waxes nostalgic about the revolution's many achievements. Her middle-age son speaks of disillusionment and broken promises. Her granddaughter believes Castro's passing augurs new opportunities under younger leaders. \n\nThe story of three generations of Cadet's family is, in many ways, the story of Castro's Cuba.      \n\nMaria del Socorro Cadet Napoles, 73\n\nCadet, born in 1942, learned to toil the land in her father's small farm as a young girl.\n\nAfter losing their mother to a heart attack, the 10 Cadet children lived with their father in a village outside Santiago near the shrine to Our Lady of Charity, the island's venerable patron saint.\n\nShe was 7 when her mother died. She went to work on the farm, carrying water-filled tins on her shoulders or stacks of firewood on her head.  \n\n\"Life was hard,\" Cadet said. \"If you didn't work, you didn't eat. We never missed a meal because we learned to work.\"\n\nHer village was made up of mostly black, illiterate peasant farmers. Many walked around in their bare feet. Adequate health care was scarce.\n\nLighter-skinned Cubans dominated the economy and government under Fulgencio Batista, whose dictatorship was known for corruption, violence and cronyism.\n\nCadet, who is black, remembered the police regularly beating black Cubans, especially when they congregated to talk about the anti-Batista guerillas in the nearby mountains.\n\n\"In those days, white people stiffened at the sight of a black man,\" she said. \"They viewed all blacks as thieves.\" \n\nIn 1961, at age 18, Cadet went to live with a sister who worked in a Havana preschool.\n\nFor a time, Cadet said, she earned a few pesos a week cleaning the homes and hand washing the clothes of well-heeled families who had not yet fled the island for Miami.\n\nShe did domestic work for Spaniards who were constructing factories in the early years of the revolution.\n\nCadet later cooked and served food at a military unit run by the late Vilma Espin.\n\nA onetime socialite who fought alongside the Castro brothers in the mountains, Espin married Raul Castro and became an advocate of women's rights. \n\nCadet recalled serving food and drinks to \"internationalists\" every International Women's Day. \n\n\"I tended to them all,\" she said. \"I worked like a mule. I was tired, but had to keep going.\"\n\nThe revolution enabled her, a black woman, to appear in movies and novelas after she answered a casing call by the Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry. Cuba's hotels and nightclubs opened for the first time to blacks under Castro's reign, she said. \n\nShe was reminded that it was Raul Castro who lifted the ban on Cubans staying in tourist hotels in 2008.\n\n\"Under Batista, we were worse off,\" Cadet said. \n\nHer son erupts in laughter. \n\n\"I'm being sincere,\" she said.  \n\nCadet lived through key moments during the heady first years of the revolution.\n\nThere was Cuba's victory in the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, which was led by US-backed exiles intent on toppling Castro. In October 1962, a tense 13-day standoff between Washington and Moscow over the installation of Soviet missiles on the island brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.\n\nLast Saturday morning, Cadet turned on the radio and learned of Castro's death. She recalled seeing him on state-run television several weeks earlier. His frail appearance pained her. \n\n\"I never thought Fidel would die,\" she said. \"I thought he was eternal.\"\n\nShe took pills for her nerves that morning. Her heart pounded.\n\n\"That man did so much for Cuba and the world,\" she said.\n\n\"Look at how many doctors he has sent all over the world. I know everyone has to die some day but I thought he would live forever.\"\n\nShe said she's unsure of what course current President Raul Castro will take her beloved country.\n\nDoes she have as much faith in him as she did in his brother?\n\n\"I can't answer that,\" she said. \n\nManuel Giron Cadet, 52 \n\nCadet gave birth to her first son, Manuel Giron Cadet, in Havana on October 12, 1964. She later separated from his father. \n\nGiron learned about Castro's revolution in school and from his mother. He grew up around fading communist slogans plastered across billboards throughout the capital. \n\n\"I was taught a lot about the revolution, but I wasn't very revolutionary,\" he said. \n\nAs he got older, Giron started to ask questions about the struggles of everyday life under the socialist-nationalist system. About the inequalities and racism that persisted over the years. \n\n\"I was very tough,\" he said. \"I spoke the truth.\"  \n\nFor a time, Giron said, he attended the same schools as the children and grandchildren of Fidel and Raul Castro. \n\n\"I saw the differences in our lives,\" he said.\n\n\"That made me a little rebellious. There were the haves and the have-nots. The government people were not the same as the rest of us. They lived in houses with swimming pools. They traveled to Europe. We couldn't do that.\" \n\nCadet lived through the scarcity and severe hardships that started in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba's longtime benefactor.\n\nThe Special Period in Time of Peace, as the Castro euphemistically called it, lasted through the decade. Cuba continued to struggle well into the 21st century.\n\n\"It was all very hard for me,\" he said. \"We have been living a lie.\"  \n\nOver the years, as Cuba slowly experimented with free-market reforms, Giron became disenchanted with the growing economic divide. \n\n\"There is a new bourgeoisie -- people with small businesses and people who receive money from abroad,\" said Giron, who earns just over $20 a month -- about the national average -- as a massage therapist. \n\nThe Castros have maintained power through repression, Giron said.  \n\nHuman rights groups have said that among the practices that emerged under Fidel Castro's rule included surveillance, beatings, arbitrary detention and public acts of repudiation.\n\nAs a gay man, Giron said, he has never lost sight that gay men were put in labor camps in the early days of the revolution. Today, there is a little more tolerance.  \n\nHe knows he could be jailed for his comments, he said. He has never spoken out publicly against the government. \n\n\"I'm not afraid,\" he said. \"Raul himself has said we need to discuss things more openly. I speak the truth.\"\n\nThe pillars of Castro's revolution -- free access to public services such as health care and education -- have been undermined by repression, Giron said. \n\nGiron is not in mourning. The state, however, has held a number of public events honoring Castro\n\nMillions of Cubans -- many waving flags and chanting \"Fidel! Fidel!\" -- lined the route of the rebels' cross-country caravan. Flags are being flown at half-staff. On the streets of Havana, where music is always blaring, there was an eerie silence during a nine-day mourning period. Only some tourist hotels sell alcohol. \n\nMany Cubans, like Giron, go about their days as usual. They say they expect little change.  \n\nGiron, whose nickname is Manolo, said he felt nothing at the news of Castro's death. \n\n\"I'm not a communist,\" he said. \"I'm not a Fidelista. I am Manolo.\"\n\nHe added, \"The revolution will not die. This is a dynasty. It's all in the family.\" \n\nMaria de Fatima Bell Zerquera, 20\n\nMaria de Fatima Bell Zerquera, the only child of Cadet's daughter, was born in the Cuban capital on May 13, 1996. She studies accounting at the University of Havana. \n\nBell's mother works in a bank, her father at a market. They used money from their meager salaries to construct a small, two-story concrete house on what was a garden on the side of Cadet's home. \n\n\"We used to live better,\" she said. \"After the construction, we've had to limit ourselves economically.\"\n\nThe two homes share a narrow backyard. The family cooks and eats together. They watch TV or sit on the front porch on hot nights. Their ability to laugh at their differences has brought them closer.  \n\n\"My grandmother is a revolutionary,\" Bell said the other day. \n\nHer uncle shot back, \"No, she's a communist.\"\n\nThey burst out laughing.  \n\n\"No, my grandmother isn't a communist or a revolutionary,\" Bell said. \"My grandmother is Fidelista.\"\n\nBell said she has benefited from the fruits of Castro's revolution. She's grateful for the free health care and university education afforded to her.\n\nBut she admits there could be more personal freedoms and economic opportunities.\n\n\"Not everyone has the same rights,\" Bell said. \"There are people who just move a finger and they accomplish everything and people who work harder than others.\"\n\nShe was 10 when an intestinal illness that required several surgeries forced Castro to relinquish his duties temporarily to younger brother Raul in July 2006.\n\nCastro resigned as president in February 2008. Raul took over permanently.\n\nBell had little exposure to the man who was Cuba's leader for 47 years.\n\n\"I didn't know him and, in this time of my life, he wasn't in charge,\" she said.\n\nHer uncle interjected, \"Yes, I had to get Fidel.\" \n\nThey laughed. \n\nBell added, \"What I can tell you is that Fidel did a lot of things that we should applaud and he will always be a part of Cuba's legacy. He's the most important person Cuba has had and he will always be.\"\n\nWhen she awoke last Saturday, her mother told her Castro was dead. \n\n\"It wasn't that painful or emotional,\" Bell said. \"I didn't have that feeling that other people who knew him felt, people who benefited from him.\"\n\nBell hopes Castro's death portends a new beginning. \n\n\"I'd like to see a lot of changes... toward more freedom, a better economy, something better,\" she said.\n\n\"We need more freedom of expression, liberty to ... travel, to know other countries, study in other countries, learn other cultures.\" \n\nBell's generation will be the real architects of change, she said. \n\n\"I don't consider myself a revolutionary,\" she said. \"I consider myself a Cuban who is loyal to her country and who can help achieve big changes...a Cuban who wants to prosper and work for the well-being of her country.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.382488489151, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1744, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 16, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.40737176653, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 46, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161203180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.63761467889908, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.18181818182}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/opinions/trumps-fast-and-furious-first-week-zelizer/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Trump's fast and furious first week: The strategy", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1294, "date": "20170129040000", "story_content": "President Trump is moving at a fast and furious pace. He is overwhelming Washington with a series of provocative executive orders that aim to fulfill his campaign promises.\n\nTrump issued an explosive executive order closing the borders to refugees for 120 days and to citizens from seven countries with Muslim majorities for 90 days. \n\nThe president has instructed the agencies to scale back on the Affordable Care Act. He has directed them to start preparing to build the famous border wall with Mexico, in addition to hiring 5,000 more border agents. \n\nAnother executive order has called for the deportation of persons convicted or charged with a crime or who \"pose a risk to public safety or national security.\" If his order is enforced, sanctuary cities will not receive federal grants. There will be a major review of all regulations on American manufacturers while he is speeding up environmental reviews on key infrastructure projects.\n\nOffering a direct jab at environmental activists, the president has ordered permits for the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Keystone Pipeline. He has put into place a hiring freeze in many federal agencies. Fulfilling two major pledges, Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and announced that federal dollars would not be distributed to international non-governmental organizations that provide abortion. And there has been more.\n\nNo joke\n\nIf anyone doubted that President Trump meant business they should realize that this is no joke. Predictions about the First Hundred Days might now turn into discussions about the First Seven Days. Democrats are learning that the frenetic energy from FDR's famous start in office in 1933 doesn't feel so good when you are sitting on the other side of the political aisle. The president took some very big steps in his first week that signal the growing likelihood of a transformative and rightward period in American political history. The ban on refugees has awakened many people here in the US. and around the globe to just what's at stake with this presidency. \n\nWhile Republicans don't always like the way Trump handles himself personally and they have problems with some of the positions, such as his statements about Russia, overall on Capitol Hill there has been a lot for Republicans to celebrate. As President Trump told a retreat of Republicans, \"you're not wasting your time.\"\n\nFrom the moment of his inauguration, Trump is revealing exactly how he plans to handle the challenges that stemmed from the 2016 election. \n\nJust as President George W. Bush had to figure out how to govern after the contested 2000 election that was settled by a Supreme Court decision, President Trump needs to figure out how to move forward forcefully despite losing the popular vote by nearly three million votes and despite the controversy that surrounded the election as a result of FBI Director James Comey's letters about Hillary Clinton and the rampant evidence of Russian intervention.\n\nBehind the lies\n\nTo the frustration of his opponents, one of Trump's main tactics is to simply spread false information to support his claim that this was an election which gave him a mandate for sweeping change. Whatever his intentions are, he is telling lies. The most controversial and potentially damaging of these statements has revolved around repeated allegations that the only reason Hillary Clinton won the popular vote was because of massive voter fraud, much of it by illegal immigrants, that cost him at the ballot box.\n\nThere is zero evidence of such fraud and the claim has been debunked repeatedly. Regardless, Trump continues to make this claim, and he has called for an investigation as a way to erase the doubts that stem from the discrepancy between his Electoral College win and the popular vote. At the same time, Trump argues to Americans that if he had decided to campaign in places like New York and California, where the outcome of the electoral votes were never in doubt, he would have won the popular vote.\n\nThe controversy over how many people attended his inauguration, while one of the sillier moments of the week, also comes out of this effort by the administration to change the basic narrative about his weak support.\n\nFor many who were watching, it appeared that the inauguration drew only modest crowds, while the protests that followed attracted an enormous number of people all over the country.\n\nWith polls showing that he comes into office with the lowest approval ratings of any president in recent history, Trump is dismissive -- reminding people of the polling mistakes that were made with the election -- and keeps saying there are other polls out there showing this was not the case.\n\nBolstering his base \n\nMore important, Trump is betting that his big executive actions, which are all coming before he proposes any major legislation, will bolster his base of passionate supporters by throwing them red meat.\n\n\"Trump's done more in five days than Obama did in eight years,\" said one construction worker in Ohio. \n\nTrump is looking to bring his campaign coalition into the governing process in a way that President Obama had trouble doing. The recent announcements are as much about politics as policy. The effect of these actions will be to confirm to the millions of Americans who voted for him that he is a leader who moves forward with his promises and who is not afraid to take big steps, regardless of what the conventional wisdom says.  \n\nMany Americans might not like him, but the White House is betting that they will respect him as a chief executive who can move policies in an era in gridlock. This will be important so that when he does send Congress legislation, most Republicans will have little appetite to anger his energized supporters, and Democrats from swing states and districts, with a nervous eye on 2018, might just be willing to go along with some of his programs. The blitz of executive orders and memorandums are a way to undercut congressional opposition in the coming months.\n\nAnd right now, the Congress is proving just how much polarization and unified government are working in his favor. The basic fact is that, like LBJ in 1965, Trump now enjoys one of those rare moments of unified government where the conditions for legislating are very good.\n\nNot only do Republicans control the House and Senate, but the party is extremely disciplined and relatively united on most key issues. Congressional Republicans have rallied around the president on his Cabinet picks no matter how controversial. There has been little public blowback about the executive orders thus far, most of which fit very well on the conservative GOP agenda.\n\nCongressional Republicans are aware of the opportunity they have to legislate and to move American policy in a rightward direction while dismantling President Obama's legacy. Thus far, Trump has been able to count on them. \n\nAt the same time, recent weeks have shown just how fragile the Democratic Party has become. The resistance to Trump has been negligible. Democrats have stood by as Trump makes his moves. They look more like deer in the political headlights than prizefighters struggling to change the direction of a match.\n\nFor all the controversy and for all the chaos, the first week of the Trump administration, from the perspective of his supporters, has been a successful one. The outlines of a strategy have now become clear as are the very grave risks that Democrats will face if they keep passively watching this unfold.\n\nThe executive order on refugees might be the first of Trump's decisions to start stimulating some serious grassroots and political opposition to this exertion of presidential power. But, as the first week has shown, it will take much more than complaints and simple protests to check this ambitious presidential agenda.

And in a move that defies decades of tradition, it's been reported he is also taking an active role in shaping diplomatic efforts; there are reports that Israel asked Trump for help in getting the US to veto a Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements \u2014 proposed and then delayed by Egypt, and subsequently passed on Friday. Ultimately the United States abstained.\n\nFriedman, a bankruptcy lawyer with no relevant experience, is president of the US fundraising arm for Bet El, a settlement built on occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank. His extremist record includes calling President Obama an anti-Semite and labeling American Jews who criticize Israel's military occupation \"kapos,\" a term used for Nazi collaborators. At a time when bold US leadership is required to stop the Israelis from flying off a cliff, destroying any chance of peace, Friedman is the exact opposite of who we need in a diplomatic position. \n\nBoth Trump and Friedman have promised to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, thereby recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the city. At best, in one fell swoop Friedman would serve to normalize the acquisition of territory by force. At worst, such reckless disregard for international law and the highly sensitive issues involved could egg on a diplomatic Armageddon.\n\nFriedman is simply the latest in a string of indicators underlining the President-elect's intention to dismantle US policy going back to the Carter administration acknowledging that Israeli settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian territories violates the Fourth Geneva Convention, which states that an occupying power cannot transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.\n\nThough Secretary of State John Kerry said recently at the Saban Forum that the failure of peace talks is largely attributable to Israel's continued settlement construction, Trump has said he thought more settlements \u2014 not less \u2014 should be built in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. That wasn't just campaign bluster. Trump reportedly donated $10,000 to Friedman's settlement fund well before his run for the presidency. \n\nThe settlement in question, Bet El, is located deep in the West Bank, on Ramallah's doorstep, and only meters away from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' home. Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, whom the President-elect implausibly suggested could assist with brokering an Israel-Palestine peace agreement, is reported to have contributed through his family foundation to the same. \n\nFriedman shares Israel's vision of a state where a Jewish majority is maintained at all costs, even if it means treating Palestinians like a \"demographic threat\" by enforcing apartheid policies on both sides of the Green Line.  He isn't concerned about settlements because he believes  annexing the West Bank (but not Gaza) would not pose a threat to Israel's Jewish majority. He doesn't say whether Trump would support extending Israeli citizenship and voting rights to the 2.7 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank whose land will be annexed, but it is safe to say Israel would not be interested in doing so. Trump's adviser then appears to support legal apartheid. If Trump and his advisers believe Israel can annex Palestinian land without extending political rights to the people, January 20 will see the inauguration of a new US administration as well as the death of the two-state solution. \n\nThis potential future of America's Israel policy, shaped by Friedman, is indeed grim, prompting the international community to speculate about what Obama could do before leaving office to preserve the two-state solution. Some believe he won't do anything significant, despite the fact that according to a poll released by the Brookings Institution, 70% of Democrats and a plurality (46%) of all Americans favor some sort of US action at the United Nations.\n\nInstead of abstaining from Friday's vote, the United States could finally have taken a meaningful stand against illegal settlements by supporting the resolution. This would have been in line with longstanding US policy opposing Israeli settlements \u2014policy the United States has tragically not enforced \u2014 as well as with US public opinion.\n\nIn spite of the abstention, another option left to Obama is to recognize the state of Palestine on the 1967 borders, as former President Jimmy Carter has recommended. This would also send a clear message about the illegitimacy of Israeli settlements and the right of Palestinians to live free from military occupation and foreign domination.  \n\nLet's be clear: If Obama chooses not to act, he will hold the distinction of being the US president responsible for cementing Israel's occupation over Palestinian land indefinitely, which many observers, including no fewer than four former Israeli prime ministers, have compared to apartheid. In April 2014, Kerry warned Israel was in danger of becoming an apartheid state if a two-state deal was not reached soon. While it's true President-elect Trump may radically alter US policy, Obama still has a chance to salvage his own legacy in Palestine and Israel after spending the last eight years warning of the dangers of Israeli rejectionism and settlement growth while failing to take any concrete action to stop them.\n\nThe United States can and must demonstrate principled leadership. If Obama is truly concerned with the fate of Israelis and Palestinians, with US foreign policy objectives in the Middle East, or with US national security, one thing he can't afford to do is nothing. A bold move by Obama can help advance the cause of Palestinian freedom in the international arena, and move US discourse on Palestine and Israel forward before Trump and Friedman come to power. The policies of the incoming Trump administration may still cause havoc, leading to accelerated settlement growth and the death of the long-endangered two-state solution. But at least there will be a precedent for future American leaders to take stronger action to help bring peace to the region.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.8218693733215297, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1031, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.8633689747, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161223000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.9767216294859398, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.edition.cnn.com/2017/01/26/health/finland-tobacco-free-plan/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1441, "scraper_regex": 1543}}, "headline": "What Finland's plan to be tobacco-free can teach the world", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1543, "date": "20170126220000", "story_content": "The Finnish government has set an ambitious goal for residents in a bid to benefit their health -- and their bank balances.\n\nOfficials plan to make the country tobacco-free by 2040, meaning they want less than 2% of their adults to consume tobacco -- in any form -- by that deadline.\n\nSo that's more than 98% of the Finnish population saying no to cigarettes, snuff and other forms of smokeless tobacco, cigars, pipes and even e-cigarettes. \n\nAs per the trend in industralized countries, smoking rates in Finland have been on the decline in recent decades due to measures such as bans on advertising and shop displays, and the creation of smoke-free public spaces. In 2013, 16% of 15- to 64-year-olds in Finland smoked on a daily basis, while nearby in the UK, 19% of adults were smokers in 2014. \n\nBut at the start of this year, a new level of control measures came into force.\n\n\"The Finnish approach is revolutionary,\" said Kaari Paaso, head of the unit on harm prevention at the country's Ministry of Health and Social Affairs. \"We want to get rid of all tobacco products.\" \n\nExperts agree that the Finnish government is using innovation and creativity to get everyone to kick the habit.\n\nRather than targeting one area at a time, such as exposure in public spaces or cigarette use, Paaso said his ministry wants to be precautionary from every angle. It doesn't go down the path of advocating milder products that may do less harm, such as e-cigarettes or snuff. \"It's a comprehensive set of policies,\" he said.\n\nFor example, neighboring Sweden has also seen a dramatic reduction in the number of smokers -- just 12.7% among men and 15.2% among women in 2013 -- but achieved this in part by promoting the use of snus, an oral smokeless tobacco product. The product, along with all other forms of oral tobacco, is banned in other member states of the European Union.\n\nThe UK is also adopting a harm reduction approach to reduce the number of smokers. Instead of snus, it backs the use of e-cigarettes to help people kick the habit.\n\nBut Finland wants rid of it all.\n\n\"We don't want to fall into the trap of other policies that have less harmful products,\" said Paaso, who fears that promoting other products will result in a new addiction for health officials to deal with in the future. \"We want to phase out all products.\"\n\nAnd that phasing out has begun.\n\nRaising the cost of selling tobacco\n\nExperts agree that one of the strongest policies in terms of tobacco control globally has been taxation. The rising cost of the habit, linked to higher taxes, has meant that many can no longer afford to smoke, and those who can smoke provide revenue for anti-smoking campaigns and quitting support services, to name a few options.\n\n\"The evidence suggests increasing pricing is the single most effective way to reduce demand,\" said Vaughan Rees, director of the Center for Global Tobacco Control at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \n\n\"In states where we see the highest tax rates, we see the lowest prevalence,\" he said, highlighting New York City, where then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg introduced city taxes on top of state taxes in 2010. Just over 14% of New Yorkers smoked in 2016, according to the NYC Smoke-Free program.\n\nSo Finland has now introduced another giant financial barrier for users: It increased the costs for vendors selling tobacco products.\n\n\"There's quite a high fee to license it and to sell it,\" Paaso said.\n\nAny business wanting to sell tobacco must first apply and pay for a license, a one-off process, but an additional fee must be paid annually to cover the costs of surveillance officers in each municipality who will check that retailers are following the rules.\n\nThe surveillance fee is the killer, as this is calculated per checkout or cashier in any business and can be as high as \u20ac500 ($536) annually per checkout.\n\nThe fee is now set by individual municipalities, not the state, many of whom have decided this upper limit should be the actual cost. \n\n\"This has resulted in criticism from small shop owners and big stores ... saying it is disproportionally high from last year,\" Paaso said. \"But that was not the idea.\" The ministry had hoped the fee would be scaled up annually.\n\nA store with 10 checkouts could therefore pay more than $5,000 per year in addition to its license fee to sell tobacco to the public.\n\n\"Finland has come very far ... and now they're going to the next level, with innovation,\" said Kelly Henning, director of the public health program at Bloomberg Philanthropies, an organization working to promote impactful tobacco control policies, founded by the former New York mayor.\n\nHenning highlights that the World Health Organization's Tobacco Free Initiative has six steps it recommends for effective control, known as MPOWER. The last letter stands for \"Raising taxes on tobacco.\"\n\n\"They have in place all MPOWER policies at the highest possible level,\" she said.\n\nSmoke-free balconies and cars\n\nAnother unique approach the Scandinavian country implemented this month was the ability to apply for a ban on people smoking on neighboring balconies if their presence is a disturbance. \n\nHousing companies may now apply for the ban if smoke is seen to be spreading from someone's private balcony and onto other spaces. As in many other countries, bans are in place in public areas, but this new policy addresses a smoker's private space.\n\n\"You can apply for a ban,\" Paaso said. \"There hasn't been big change ... but these measures are still quite new.\"\n\nFinnish residents are also no longer allowed to smoke in private cars if people under the age of 15 are present. This is not unique, as other countries such as the UK have imposed bans in cars when children are present. In the UK, the cutoff age is higher, at 18.\n\nPreventing the appeal to minors\n\nOne key strategy in Finland's approach to eradicate smoking is reducing the number of teenagers picking up the habit in the first place, by reducing its presence and its appeal.\n\nAs a result, new policies also limit the purchase of products that imitate tobacco or cigarettes, such as sweets and chocolates shaped as pipes or cigarettes. Though these products aren't banned, they face restrictions. For example, stores where customers receive discounts through the use of a loyalty card cannot offer such discounts on such items.\n\nBut much bigger restrictions face the e-cigarette industry. \"E-cigarettes are sold in normal shops, but we have strict rules,\" Paaso said.\n\nAs of August, e-cigarettes had the same restrictions in terms of sales and public use as regular cigarettes, such as age limits, and they are no longer allowed to have any flavors. \"They cannot have any distinctive taste,\" Paaso said, adding, \"our approach is this basic idea to phase out all nicotine products.\"\n\nThe use of flavors in e-cigarettes has been the subject of much debate, amid fears that they will entice young people toward the habit and act as a gateway into smoking.\n\n\"That's absolutely crucial,\" said Harvard's Rees, who believes that e-cigarettes can be a useful tool to help people quit smoking and advocates the UK's stance on harm reduction. But his support ends when flavors are involved. \"We're seeing a proliferation in flavors, including gummy bear and candy flavors that are intrinsically appealing to children.\"\n\nA global mission?\n\nFinland is not alone in wanting to reduce smoking and all tobacco-related habits among its population.\n\nHenning and Rees highlight Australia, where plain packaging on cigarette boxes in combination with taxation has helped bring numbers down rapidly. In 2014-15, just 14.7% of adults 18 or over smoked daily -- less than than Finland -- compared with more than 16% in 2011-12.\n\n\"They increased the price dramatically, and we're now seeing a benefit,\" Rees said. \n\nOn the other end of the spectrum lies China. After a surge in demand for tobacco products in recent years as more people took up smoking, three cities have banned smoking indoors in public places, including the capital, Beijing.\n\n\"Tobacco-related deaths are rising because male smoking rates are so high,\" Henning said. More than 1.3 million people die each year of tobacco-related disease in China, according to the Tobacco Atlas, linked to the fact that more than 45% of men are smokers. \"We're optimistic that these cities are going to lead the way.\"\n\nOn a global level, the WHO set a goal to reduce tobacco use among people over the age of 15 by 30% by 2025, to fit in line with goals to reduce rates of non-communicable disease, like cancer, as a result.\n\nBut Finland remains a pioneer, the first country to set a goal to end the problem in its entirety. Experts, as well as the government, believe they can make it happen.\n\n\"Governments should set themselves that goal of achieving exactly that,\" Rees said. But he acknowledges that not all countries would necessarily be able to achieve it, with culture playing a key role. \"Finland, having a much more control over a relatively homogenous population, can realistically set that goal.\"\n\nAnd Henning agrees that simply setting a target can make a difference. \"It's a long shot,\" she said. \"But Finland believes it's achievable.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.12674270570278198, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1441, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.73936712242, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.80430256766135, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/22/europe/new-russia-generation/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1035, "scraper_regex": 1119}}, "headline": "What millennials think of Putin's Russia", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1119, "date": "20161222120000", "story_content": "They were born in the New Russia, after the old Soviet Union had collapsed.

But other people -- some journalists or writers, famous ones like Solzhenitsyn -- have a different view of this situation.\"\n\nFor Russian teenagers like these, the painful chapters of Soviet repression, midnight arrests and the forced labor camps of the Gulag, depicted by the writer Alexandr Solzhenitsyn, are like ancient history.\n\nBefore their time\n\nMost of the students have a on-the-one-hand... on-the-other-hand approach: a more theoretical, historical viewpoint, and a personal viewpoint, based on their parents' or grandparents' experiences.\n\nAlexander, 17, says the end of the Soviet Union \"had something good for the whole world,\" but also something bad.\n\n\"It was good for the world because everybody thought that 'this big Soviet Union wanted to conquer us,'\" he said.\n\nBut for people who lived in the USSR, he says, it was bad. \"They didn't know anything about their future, they thought it was the end of the world. Lots of people lost their money because of the change of the ruble from Soviet Union to the ruble of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nHis own parents, didn't suffer much, he says, and rarely talk about that time so he doesn't have any personal memories.\n\nAlexey, who's 18, recalls what his parents went through. \"Every collapse has negative consequences,\" he tells me. \"The country faced so many problems. My family faced them too.\"\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin has called the end of the Soviet Union the \"biggest geopolitical catastrophe\" of the 20th century. And for older Russians, the sudden collapse of their country was traumatic, thrusting them into a world of unemployment, rising prices -- even separation for families who now lived in separate countries. Many feel nostalgia for a simpler, more predictable time when they were young.\n\nBut, with time, that nostalgia is fading. In a new poll by Russia's Levada Center 83% of people over 55 said they regret the end of the USSR. For 40 - 54-year-olds, it fell to 63%. And among those under 40, only 40% said they regretted it.\n\nWhat does 'New Russia' look like?\n\nWith snow swirling about as we talk outside the university, Vasily, 17, is blunt: \"I think it was inevitable and it was right that it fell apart.\"\n\nI ask the students what they think their lives will be like in the New Russia. After all, they're studying at an elite university, can travel anywhere they want. They have computers, and mobile phones, and -- like teenagers everywhere -- they live on the internet and social media.\n\nSurprisingly, Daniel tells me: \"I can't say like this, that it's a good future. I think it's pretty bad, because I actually don't like the real situation in Russia now. Some things are really disappointing to me, like corruption -- it's terrible -- but I hope it will all change.\"\n\nYura tells me Russia is improving. \"There are a lot of projects being designed now. A path forward is being created. There's no stagnation or something. There's nothing bad.\"\n\nWhen I ask Alexey whether he thinks he'll have a good life in Russia, he uses a famous Soviet-era phrase in Russian that his grandfather could have used: \"a bright future.\"\n\n\"Well I hope for a bright future but who knows what's going to happen next. It's possible things will turn out not the way we wanted them. There might be war or something. There's a possibility there might be a Third World War.\"\n\nHis friend Vasily, on the other hand, is \"positive\" about his future. \"Life is ahead of me,\" he says, using another old Soviet expression, \"Hope and wait, all life is ahead!\"\n\nBut he doesn't see himself -- or Russia -- as part of Europe. The Russian \"mentality,\" he explains, \"is different from the European.\"\n\nRussia, he says, will find it's own way. \"Russia is a completely different state with its own mentality and its own moral principles that developed a long time ago. So to copy something and implement it here from the West - Europe or America - it's absolutely useless - it won't take root,\" Vasily says.\n\nIn their eyes: Putin the statesman\n\nThat idea sounds very much like the world view of Putin, who has been trying to build national consensus on Russia's unique history and role in the world.\n\nMost of these students seem satisfied with the man who has been in the Kremlin since before they were born.\n\nYura says he has a \"good\" opinion of Putin: \"Everything is great. I'm satisfied with everything in my country.\"\n\nAlexey agrees:  \"Of course, thanks to him, we have no problems in our country. Well, we do have them but he softens them. So his policy is right. I support it.\"\n\nThese young Russians may not remember the old Cold War, but they have their own \"new\" Cold War, with President Putin challenging America's leadership.\n\n\"What we see now is certainly unpleasant and everyone understands that no one benefits from it,\" says Vasily. \"I hope he (Donald Trump) will have a dialogue with us, we'll keep it going and everything will be good. Maybe we won't be friends but we will have fruitful economic relations.\"\n\nDaniel is less sure. \"It won't to be better,\" he says. \"I think it will be the same.\"\n\nIn the New Russia, personalities matter and, for many Russians, Putin defines his country.\n\n\"Relations are supposed to change because it's a change of person,\" Alexander tells me. \"Donald Trump talked about president Putin. He said he was actually a great leader, and I think that president Putin also respects Donald Trump. So I think that relationship will improve between America and Russia.\"\n\n Like these students, modern Russia is young -- born just 25 years ago. They will grow up along with their country. And what it will become is in their hands.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.43440487980842607, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1035, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 13, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.8462174184199993, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.60869565217391, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/24/opinions/cervical-cancer-rates-caudle-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "New cervical cancer research is personal ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 836, "date": "20170125010000", "story_content": "A new study published earlier this week in the journal Cancer reveals that mortality rates are far higher and racial disparities in mortality are far larger than was previously thought for cervical cancer,  a disease that can be screened for and for which there is a vaccine. \n\nAs an Osteopathic Family Physician who provides women's health services to my patients as well as medical care for general medical conditions, these findings directly impact my patients and my profession. As a black woman, they affect me personally. As a family physician, this study was a hard pill to swallow, but as a black woman it is even harder. \n\nRacial disparities in health exist not only with cervical cancer but other cancers and medical conditions as well. The National Cancer Institute states that African-Americans have the highest mortality rate \"of any racial or ethnic group for all cancers combined and for most major cancers.\" Furthermore, for all cancers combined, \"the death rates is 25% higher for African-Americans/blacks than for whites.\n\nResearchers who conducted the study found that a lack of consideration for hysterectomy rates in prior studies has resulted in an \"underestimation\" of mortality rates and racial disparities regarding cervical cancer. When researchers adjusted US cervical mortality rates and racial disparities for the presence of hysterectomy in the study population, the results were staggering.\n\nPerhaps one of the most dramatic findings by researchers is that without correction for hysterectomy, racial disparities for cancer mortality rates between black and white women have been underestimated by about 44%. Somewhat more hopefully, the study showed that black women had a significant yearly decrease in cervical cancer mortality overall when compared to white women after correction for hysterectomy. \n\nThe sobering news is, however, that upon adjusting for hysterectomy, researchers found that the mortality for black women increased from 5.7 per 100,000 (uncorrected) to 10.1 per 100,000 (corrected) and for white women, the mortality rate increased from 3.2 per 100,000 (uncorrected) to 4.7 per 100,000 (corrected). Both corrected and uncorrected age-specific cervical cancer mortality rates were much higher for black women than white women across all age groups except 20-29 and 35-39 -- and black women over 85 were at greatest risk of death. \n\nThe issue of the hysterectomy is clearly a key piece of information. One reason why is the body mechanics involved in complete hysterectomy, which also removes the cervix. Another reason, cited by study researchers, is a matter of numbers. Black women have the highest prevalence of hysterectomy. Thus the presence, or lack of, a hysterectomy potentially impacts how to measure the incidence of cervical cancer by race. \n\nI have long known that health disparities exist between and among social groups. This is not a new phenomenon and it is not unique to cervical cancer, but it still takes my breath away that racial disparities in health continue to be so robust. \n\nSo why do health disparities by race persist and what can we do to fix them? The answer to both questions: It's complicated. Institutions including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Institute of Medicine, the World Health Organization and so many others have been working on identifying and reducing racial disparities in health for years. In this study, researchers suggest as possible factors a lack of access to care, decreased follow-up for abnormal results and disparities in cervical cancer treatments offered. I agree with the study's authors. Access to quality care -- something I think all Americans should have -- is a crucial component to good health. This study underscores just how important this is. \n\nThe study also mentions that differences in cancer types may contribute to disparities in age and race: \"The rates of adenocarcinoma in black women increase with age, whereas they plateau at the age of 35 in white women. ... Compared with squamous histology, adenocarcinoma is associated with a worse prognosis and worse survival for both early  and late-stage disease.\"  \n\nThe most critical reason access to affordable, quality care is so crucial is because it increases the likelihood of prevention. As a family physician, I also know how important preventive services such as mammograms, colonoscopies and pap smears (the most common screening test for cervical cancer) are. For cervical cancer, vaccines are also important. HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) vaccines -- recommended since 2006 -- protect against strains of the HPV virus that cause most cervical cancers. Undoubtedly, the role of the HPV vaccine is important in preventing cervical cancer, and it is a vaccine that I routinely recommend and administer to my patients. \n\nThis study illustrates in stark terms the importance of accessible health care at a time when our current health care landscape is changing, as the Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010 will likely undergo change with the new administration. This may also mean a change for organizations that provide health services to women. As we work to improve mortality rates for all cancers and look for causes and solutions for racial disparities in health, these recent findings about cervical cancer should be part of the discussion.

This week, he tweeted that if Chicago can't get control of its murder rate -- 268 people shot so far just this month, 47 killed  -- then he may bring in federal assistance. \n\nOne thing I'm not is a Trump fan. One thing I am, though, is urgently concerned with the fate of poor black communities. In that, Trump's intention here brings to mind a conversation I had with Brown University economist Glenn Loury on the videochat series Bloggingheads.\n\nLast year, he and I speculated that if Trump made an offer to black America to directly address the problems of poor black communities, then no matter how constructive his offer was, the black punditocracy's  \"smart\" take would be to reject Trump's offer because he is Republican and seems less than pure of racist sentiments in his private person. \n\nSadly, this prediction has been borne out. The theme is logical contradictions.\n\nWhen Trump has called attention to the state of poor black communities, focusing on the level of violence their residents must live with daily, the concerned thinker has typically classified it as an insult to black people. Yet these are the same people who, on a different day, assail America for turning a blind eye to the problems of poor black Americans.\n\nTrump is called a racist to say of black communities that \"You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs.\" He is surely painting with a broad brush, but he should not be dismissed as a racist because he lacks subtlety. After all, the media urgently covers the anti-gang activities of figures like Father Michael Pfleger, a white pastor from Chicago, implying that people like him are battling a problem that is quite real.\n\nOr, Trump is supposedly a racist to talk of the \"carnage\" in places like Chicago, but then it is considered enlightened wisdom to assail the mainstream media for caring more about the disappearance of white people like Natalee Holloway than of the legions of black people killed by rarely-apprehended assailants year after year.\n\nIf America is to be indicted for not caring about black people killing one another, then why is it racist and dismissible when Trump says that we need to do something about black people killing one another?\n\nIt's also not as simple as just saying that these communities need jobs as Jesse Jackson said in a Twitter response to Trump's call for federal action in Chicago. However, anyone familiar with poor communities in America these days knows that the reason guys are shooting each other over sneakers is not only because they could not find gainful, legal employment.\n\nThere is more to the story. Even authoritative, sympathetic scholars' work shows that more than a few of these guys are tempted to the streets by the inadequacy of schooling, the availability of work on the black market selling drugs, and how easy it is to have a gun. \n\nParts of William Julius Wilson's \"When Work Disappears\" show such men turning down available work, for example. Beware also the op-ed page truism that black male unemployment is due to factory jobs moving overseas. The same men's unemployment rates went down and stayed down even in cities where factory jobs did not disappear in this way. \n\nRead classic works on inner city lives such as sociologist Sudhir Venkatesh's \"Gang Leader for a Day\" or Alice Goffman's \"On the Run,\" and any sense that men in these communities were all but barred from legal work falls to pieces. The reality is, as so often, much more complicated.\n\nBut we are not to think this way. Instead, there have been chin-scratching analyses of the term inner city, implying that Trump is wrong to even consider there to exist such settings. We are to think of the shooting death by white cops of Laquan McDonald -- itself absolutely appalling -- as somehow the \"real\" story in Chicago despite that the relatives of the 762 people killed in Chicago last year surely found the loss of their loved ones equally appalling. \n\nThe people reacting to Trump's statements in this way see themselves as agitating in poor black people's favor, but their actual positions all point to something somewhat different: patrolling Trump and the rest of America for racist sentiments. That patrol can feel like the quintessence of helping people, but it is quite often less relevant to actually helping people in their actual lives. \n\nI have no idea whether Trump, as unreflective and uninformed a soul  he is, will really be able to have an effect on poor black communities. However, given that we can't pry this man out of the White House for the time being,  we need to get over this impulse to go into denial mode about black communities' problems just because the person mentioning them isn't a paragon of racial sensitivity.\n\nOK -- he says \"the African-Americans\" instead of \"African Americans\" and dissed John Lewis. Disgusting, all of it. But, unfortunately, this man has his hands on the levers of power for a while, and it's time to be pragmatic.\n\nTrump's plan could be an overly punitive hot mess, in which case we shall resist. But suppose it isn't? We can't shut our ears to any idea just because Trump lacks manners.\n\nOld-time civil rights leaders didn't have the luxury of requiring the presidents they dealt with to act as maximally free of racist sentiment as possible, and yet they got a lot done.\n\nIt's time for us to walk in their footsteps in a realer way than just holding panels on Martin Luther King Day. If Trump has some plans to lessen the \"carnage,\" let's hear him out. After all, even a stopped clock is right twice a day.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.14499521255493, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1011, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.78288961381, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 42, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170128010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.1543026706231405, "mft_mean": 3.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/22/middleeast/aleppo-syria-evacuations/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 729, "scraper_regex": 789}}, "headline": "Aleppo: Heavy snow slows evacuations of civilians and rebels", "wordcount_as_scraped": 789, "date": "20161222150000", "story_content": "Heavy snowfall and rickety vehicles have slowed the evacuation of thousands of civilians and rebel fighters from war-torn eastern Aleppo, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Thursday, as Syrian regime forces stood poised to take control of the key city.\n\nEvacuations have gone on for more than a week as government forces have retaken the vast majority of eastern Aleppo, which rebels held for more than four years after the Arab Spring uprising.\n\nEmptying the enclave would pave the way for the regime to take all of Aleppo in a major turning point in Syria's brutal civil war that has raged for almost six years and left some 400,000 people dead. \n\nSyrian regime forces as well as pro-Assad militia entered eastern Aleppo by ground in late November, backed by government airstrikes.

Now, a source familiar with transition planning says that hard wall of resistance is crumbling fast. \n\nThere are \"boxes\" of applications, the source said. \"There are many more than people realize.\" \n\nSome of those applications are coming from the #NeverTrump crowd, the source said, and include former national security officials who signed one or more of the letters opposing Trump. \"Mea culpas\" are being considered -- and in some cases being granted, the source said -- for people who did not go a step further in attacking Trump personally. \n\n\"These are rock solid patriots who have committed themselves\" to the security of the United States, but \"made a mistake\" in signing the letters, perhaps not considering the possibility that Trump could actually win and be in a position to offer them a job, the source said. \n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Trump's victory, there has been some concern that the team he would have most difficulty drafting was the one core to US safety and security. \n\nFifty GOP national security experts signed an August letter saying Trump \"would put at risk our country's national security and well-being\" because he \"lacks the character, values and experience\" to occupy the Oval Office, making him \"the most reckless president in American history.\" \n\nAnother bipartisan letter cited concern about potential foreign conflicts of interest Trump might encounter as president, and called on him to disclose them by releasing his tax returns. Trump has refused to do so, saying he is under audit and will make the returns public only once that is done.\n\nIt remains to be seen what kind of team Trump will pull together, how many \"NeverTrumpers\" will apply for positions and to what degree the President-elect will be willing to accept them. \n\nThere's a fight underway within the Trump transition team about whether to consider \"never Trumpers\" for jobs, one official tells CNN. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who is leading the transition team, has been working to persuade Trump and other top officials to consider Republicans who openly opposed his campaign. That has caused some friction with those who see no place for people who didn't support their candidate.\n\nSome longtime observers of Washington's security scene say it could mean that Trump will still have a relatively thin bench to pull from, compared to other incoming presidents. As a result, the teams he pulls together may be not as effective or cohesive as a result, some say. \n\n\"He will get people of variable quality,\" said Elliot Cohen, an advisor to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice who now teaches at Johns Hopkins University. \"They will fill those jobs, but the question is, who will they fill them with and what kind of administration will they have.\" \n\nTrump is already at work on choosing Cabinet secretaries. Names reportedly on his shortlist for the Pentagon include Stephen Hadley, the National Security Adviser to President George W. Bush, Senator Jeff Sessions and Ret. Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn, a Trump adviser, is thought to be under consideration to be National Security Adviser or to head an intelligence agency.  \n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich is being floated as a possible Trump secretary of state, as is Bush's ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, and Senator Bob Corker, chair of the foreign relations committee. And at the Department of Homeland Security Trump is reportedly considering New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. \n\nBut Trump might have more difficulty finding experienced staff just below that level -- undersecretaries, assistant secretaries and deputy assistant secretaries -- for the State and Defense departments. \n\nCohen, who helped draft one of the letters criticizing Trump, says that people entering his administration should expect it will likely \"be torn by infighting and bureaucratic skullduggery.\" He elaborates that \"some of the people will join on to the administration with serious reservations with the guy at the top. And then there will be loyalists. You set up some quite serious tension that is going to be built in.\" \n\nOthers were more sanguine. Howard Schweitzer, a GOP strategist and managing partner at Cozen O'Connor, a Washington law firm, said Trump is a pragmatist and smart enough to know you can't govern the way you campaigned. \n\n\"You have to hope he's going to take a step back and realize the enormity of what he has to deal with and surround himself with people who will give him good advice,\" Schweitzer said. Beyond ensuring a well-run administration, doing so would send an important message to the world that there will be stable, competent continuity, he said. \n\n\"He has to show our allies that he's not Doctor Strangelove,\" he said, referring to the unhinged film character who launches a nuclear bomb. \n\nStill, Schweitzer is among those who says Trump's staffing choices will likely be limited and won't include the Republican party's most experienced security hands. The 50 officials who wrote about Trump in August, including former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and ex-CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, aren't likely to volunteer for the new administration. \n\nThe second, bipartisan group of national security experts who warned in September that Trump's overseas business could pose \"significant conflicts of interest\" included GOP security luminaries such as former national security adviser Robert Blackwill, former Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis Thomas Fingar and former acting CIA Director John E. McLaughlin. \n\nTrump has said his children will run his business while he's in the White House, but experts say that won't be enough to minimize potential conflicts of interest or protect him from potential foreign pressure.\n\nAnd Omarosa Manigault, the Trump campaign's director of African-American outreach, said there's an enemies list as well. \"Let me just tell you, Mr. Trump has a long memory and we're keeping a list,\" she said. \n\nIn the end. Trump may also not prize the kind of expertise and experience represented by the letters writers. In a statement responding to his critics' August letter, Trump said \"the names on this letter are the ones the American people should look to for answers on why the world is a mess.\"\n\n\"They are nothing more than the failed Washington elite looking to hold onto their power, and it's time they are held accountable for their actions,\" Trump said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 22, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.695047795772552, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1060, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 7.38325109245, "HarmVirtue": 18, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 53, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161111190000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.81818181818, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 5.0, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/health/med-students-depression-suicide/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1306, "scraper_regex": 1421}}, "headline": "Study: More than a quarter of medical students are depressed, suicidal", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1421, "date": "20161206170000", "story_content": "More than a quarter of medical school students report depressive symptoms or depression, while about one in 10 experiences suicidal thoughts, according to a new analysis in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The analysis reviewed nearly 200 studies involving more than 129,000 students in 47 countries.\n\nDepression is \"an open secret\" in the profession, said Dr. Douglas Mata, co-principle author, a resident physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a clinical fellow at Harvard Medical School. \n\nThese calculations are more than just numbers to co-principle author Dr. Srijan Sen. \n\n\"When I was a medical student, a couple of people just a little bit older than me really suffered with depression and had serious suicide attempts, and one of them completed  suicide,\" said Sen, a professor of depression and neurosciences at the University of Michigan. \"It hit home to me and made me realize how big a problem this was and was part of the reason why I got involved in this research.\"\n\nA worldwide problem\n\nMata, Sen and their colleagues searched databases for published studies reporting the prevalence of depression in medical students. All the studies but one relied on surveys in which students reported their own symptoms.\n\n\"There were several hundred individual studies of smaller groups of students that were out there, but each on its own is not that impactful,\" said Mata. \"I thought by combining everything and saying, 'listen, this is a study with over 120,000 people in it; this is something we're seeing around the world,' it kind of underscores how serious this is.\"\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines \"major depressive disorder\" based on nine cardinal symptoms to be diagnosed during an in-person interview. Technically speaking, the surveys (which probe for these symptoms in a standardized fashion) cannot diagnose depression, said Mata. But each survey had been validated in prior studies and shown to agree with interview-based diagnoses. \n\n\"That's why we trust the data that we were able to put together,\" Mata said, noting that surveys also offer the benefits of anonymity. Since there's still some stigma associated with mood disorders, medical students are more likely to be honest about their symptoms if they don't have to worry about their attending physician or the medical board finding out their responses.\n\nMata said he was motivated by the need to provide data for policy-makers on just how widespread the problem is among future doctors, so perhaps they can try to reverse these statistics.\n\nHigh rates of depression\n\nOverall, the researchers calculated the prevalence of depression or depressive symptom as nearly 26.7%, with exactly 37,933 of 122,356 total participants reporting symptoms. A subset of 24 studies from 15 countries looked at suicidal thoughts; here the overall prevalence was 11% (or 2,043 of 21,002 participants), say the researchers.\n\nWith some variation across regions, then, medical school students are between two and five times more likely to experience depression than the general population of the United States.  \n\nSadly, the study also found that the percentage of students who see a doctor about their depression is low: just 15.7%.\n\nLast year, Mata, Sen and their colleagues published a related paper focusing on depression in medical residents. \n\n\"Taken together, these two papers paint a full picture of the life cycle of mood disorder and wellness from the beginning of medical school to the end of residency.  The two studies in combination serve as an impetus for educators and policy-makers to take this problem seriously,\" Mata said. \"What is it about the medical school environment that is leading to these adverse outcomes?\" \n\nThough his research does not answer this question, clues can be found in the real life experiences of one medical student.\n\n'Prognosis Poor'\n\n\"I was taking care of eight patients in the hospital. One woman was very sick having on and off respiratory failure, and I was concerned about her. One morning I walked into her room to find that her lips had turned blue,\" wrote Dr. Frances Southwick in her book \"Prognosis Poor,\" an account of her medical training.\n\nAfter reviving the patient and calling for help, Southwick was chewed out by a nurse and then again by a senior physician, who said, \"Your poor planning ain't my emergency.\" This same doctor took a break before helping the patient, who died eight days later. Southwick felt angry and helpless.\n\nAs her residency progressed, Southwick says, she began to experience intense depressive symptoms, including feelings of worthlessness. She became confused and irritable. Her mistakes increased; the pace of her work slowed.\n\nSleep deprivation worsened her symptoms: \"It's literally used as a torture method in a lot of countries,\" she said. Meanwhile, she said, she was giving \"150% at work,\" and although she tried to maintain her personal relationships, her support system took a hit, too.\n\nTraining to become a doctor requires a skill set that goes far beyond book smarts, explained Southwick: You need to learn about hierarchy and psychology. \n\n\"There's this phenomenon called pimping: It's a universal medical term that sounds like slang, but it's well-accepted as a term,\" she said. \"It means a senior physician asking a junior physician questions about medical topics, usually in front of his or her peers, and sometimes it is meant for actual medical education, but often, it's used as a way to enforce the hierarchy.\n\n\"You never know if you're going to be the one targeted in a pimp session,\" Southwick said. Residents change jobs every four weeks -- one month in obstetrics followed by one month in surgery, for example -- and this too creates \"amazing amounts of anxiety.\"\n\n\"You kind of have this sense of 'If I speak out or I screw up rotation or whatever, I could be kicked out of the program,' \" she said. If that happens, she explained, you won't become a physician, and you'd be stuck with $250,000 in debt.\n\nFearful and exhausted, in an environment where speaking up is discouraged, her symptoms of depression climaxed in a suicide attempt. With the help of a faculty member who prescribed antidepressants after noticing her failing mood, Southwick muddled through the remainder of her residency. \n\nToday, Southwick is in her fourth year of practice in family medicine and doing well, thanks in part to therapy.  She believes that structural changes need to be made to the medical education curriculum while psychotherapy should be routine for all students.\n\n\"Everybody suffers,\" she said, adding that even medical students who don't become depressed \"develop some level of burnout or some level of poor functioning related to job stress.\"\n\nSystems and stressors\n\nMata agrees, noting that the focus is placed on individual students or residents when systemic issues are the root cause. \n\nMany students move to new cities to fulfill residency requirements. In their new homes, they lack friends for support while facing chronic sleep deprivation and becoming exposed to high-intensity situations involving critically ill or dying patients. \n\n\"Before students start medical school, their quality of life is higher than that of age-matched peers, but after they start, their quality of life  quickly becomes lower,\" said Dr. Joan Meyer Anzia, residency program director at Northwestern University/Feinberg School of Medicine. Anzia was not involved with the current study. \n\nSadly, the problem doesn't stop when school ends. \"Physicians suicide more than people in any other profession,\" Anzia said.\n\nAlthough the newly published study has statistics that were not previously known, the problem among physicians is. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, with help from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the Mayo Clinic, has created a campaign to provide support to medical students and doctors. The resource page, which shares information about programs and resources, even includes recommendations for how training programs should respond if a resident dies by suicide.\n\nMeanwhile, mood disorders like depression are not taken seriously enough, added Mata.\n\n\"In my opinion, I don't think we should look at depression and other psychiatric illness as quote-unquote 'psychiatric illnesses' because they're also medical illnesses,\" Mata said, explaining that the brain can have problems just like any other organ. \n\nTaking a different perspective on the study results, Sen believes some of the new insights gained from studying physicians in training might help other people.\n\n\"Military populations, women in the peri- and postpartum period, people taking care of sick parents and primary caregivers -- all of these groups have high rates of depression, PTSD, anxiety or other mental illnesses related to stress,\" explained Sen. \"Maybe some of the factors that we find in physicians will carry over to these other populations.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.34246587753296, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1306, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.67628081042, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161206170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.60796324655436, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/21/opinions/trump-drone-war-in-pakistan-bergen-sterman/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Will President Trump restart the drone war in Pakistan?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1364, "date": "20170121230000", "story_content": "The American drone war in Pakistan effectively ended nearly eight months ago when the US conducted its last drone strike, killing the Taliban's leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansour.\n\nAfter using CIA drones regularly for 7 years in Pakistan -- a country  where the United States is not waging a traditional war, such as in Iraq -- the Obama administration has now presided over the longest cessation of strikes since President Obama took office, according to data collected by New America.\n\nIt is in Pakistan where the majority of CIA drone strikes have occurred under Obama, resulting in the death of a minimum of 1,904 people and perhaps as many as 3,114, according to New America's research.\n\nThe drone program has continued in other countries outside of traditional war zones, such as Yemen and Somalia, but at relatively small levels, compared to the 122 strikes in one year that occurred in Pakistan at the height of Obama's drone war there.\n\nOn Friday, Donald Trump took the oath of office. He has a key decision to make as commander in chief: Will he re-start the drone strikes?\n\nThat decision should be guided by the scope of the real threat emanating from Pakistan, rather than simply a desire to do something other than what the departing administration has done, which is often the impulse of an incoming administration.\n\nThe threat from al-Qaeda in Pakistan has receded and the need for \"force protection\" of US troops in Afghanistan has much diminished with the significant withdrawals of American forces in the past years.   \n\nThere is also a widespread perception in Pakistan that drones kill too many civilians -- according to a 2014 Pew poll, two thirds of Pakistanis believe this to be the case.\n\nAny decision to reactivate the drone campaign in Pakistan should take into account that the program and the United States are quite unpopular in the country, which has a population of more than 180 million people. \n\nThe Trump team on drones\n\nThe incoming Trump national security team has not laid out a clear policy on drone strikes, but it has made general statements suggestive of a coming escalation.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump stated, \"The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families,\" and called President Obama's war on ISIS a \"politically correct war.\" \n\nTrump brings with him appointees who have long supported the drone war.\n\nIn 2013, Mike Pompeo, Trump's nominee for Director of the CIA, stated: \"I believe the president needs a lot of space to maneuver,\" adding, \"He should have a lot of authority to make decisions about when they've identified someone who is trying to kill Americans, to be able to go in and get them.\" \n\nIn 2011, General James Mattis, who at the time was Commander of Central Command, which directs American military operations stretching from Egypt to Pakistan, and is now Trump's Defense Secretary nominee, was among those who pushed for an escalation of air strikes in Yemen. \n\nOn the other hand, members of Trump's circle have also criticized the drone war.\n\nDespite his role in pushing for an escalation of strikes in Yemen, Mattis has warned that drone warfare can give a false impression that war is manageable. \n\nIn January 2016, Michael Flynn, who is slated to be Trump's National Security Adviser, told Al Jazeera, \"When you drop a bomb from a drone ... you are gonna cause more damage than you're gonna cause good,\" adding that \"there should be a different approach.\"\n\nFlynn, however, refused to condemn Trump's comments regarding killing terrorists' family members, commenting instead: \"I would have to see the circumstances of that situation.\" He added, \"These are very difficult political decisions.\" He has also criticized the current restraints on strikes that are meant to limit collateral damage.\n\nThe Trump team on Pakistan\n\nTrump and his team have also not laid out a clear policy on U.S. relations with Pakistan.\n\nTrump has at times taken a conciliatory tone. Shortly after being elected, he told Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, \"You are a terrific guy,\" and offered, \"I am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play to address and find solutions to the outstanding problems,\" according to a Pakistani readout of a call he had with Sharif. \n\nIn his answers to questions from the Senate Armed Services Committee before his confirmation hearing last week, Mattis cautioned that conditioning aid to Pakistan has had a \"mixed history\" and that the casualties Pakistan has suffered fighting terror is a \"sign of its commitment,\" but warned he would \"review all options.\" \n\nYet in 2012 Trump tweeted a demand that Pakistan apologize for the fact that Osama bin Laden had been hiding there, commenting, \"Some 'ally.'\" \n\n Why did the strikes in Pakistan halt?\n\nThere are two explanations for the halt, which are not mutually exclusive: either the Obama administration made a decision to refrain from strikes or the cessation derives from a lack of need or opportunity to conduct strikes.\n\nThe number of strikes in Pakistan has consistently declined since their peak of 122 strikes or about ten per month in 2010. In an October interview, President Obama said he was \"troubled\" early in his presidency by \"the way in which the number of drone strikes was going up.\" \n\nYet beyond Pakistan, there is little evidence that the Obama administration has reined in its air wars against terrorist groups. In Yemen, the United States conducted more drone strikes in 2016 than any year except 2012, the peak of the campaign in the country, according to data collected by New America.\n\nIn Somalia, the United States has conducted more strikes in 2016 than during any previous year, according to New America's research.\n\nIn 2016, Washington and its coalition partners conducted more than 7,000 strikes in Iraq and Syria. \n\nAnd in Libya, the United States has conducted more than 350 air strikes since August as part of its military campaign against ISIS there.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible the Obama administration decided that it is not worth antagonizing Pakistan with further strikes. Though Pakistan has criticized American strikes before \u2014 publicly, at least \u2014 the strike on Mullah Mansour may have generated a more significant reaction as it occurred in the province of Balochistan, violating an agreement that restricted American strikes to Pakistan's tribal areas. Pakistan called the strike \"totally illegal, not acceptable and against the sovereignty and integrity of the country.\"\n\nSuch protestations have not prevented previous strikes.\n\nAnother potential explanation for the cessation is that the United States is running out of targets in Pakistan. At the peak of the drone war in Pakistan, the United States had around 100,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, while today the United States has fewer than 10,000 soldiers there, reducing the need to conduct \"force protection\" strikes. The rise and fall in drone strikes in Pakistan closely mirrors the rise and fall of American troop numbers in Afghanistan. \n\nPakistan's military operation to secure its northern tribal areas along the Afghan-Pakistan border in 2015 resulted in an influx of militants into Afghanistan as they fled Pakistan, further reducing the number of targets.\n\nThe United States has killed more than 50 al Qaeda and Taliban leaders in Pakistan since the beginning of the CIA drone campaign. In 2011, before he was killed in a US Navy SEAL raid, bin Laden was considering moving al Qaeda's key figures out of Pakistan to avoid the strikes.\n\nEven the Taliban's leadership council, which has long been able to find shelter in Pakistan's cities, may now have moved back to Afghanistan in recent months.\n\nAccording to General John W. Nicholson, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan, the United States has killed or captured 50 key al Qaeda leaders and facilitators in Afghanistan in 2016 alone. \n\nGiven his rhetoric, Trump may well escalate the drone war in Pakistan and there isn't much to stop him if he chooses to do so. A decade and half ago, Congress authorized the war in Afghanistan, which was extended to Pakistan first by George W. Bush and then Obama. \n\nUnder Obama, the drone war in Pakistan reached its height, and Trump, should he choose to do so, can easily bring that war back.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.3780403137207005, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1327, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 26, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 8.07096622888, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 26, "mft_sum": 70, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170121230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.2750565184627005, "mft_mean": 6.3636363636399995}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/31/us/orlando-pulse-911-calls/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 643, "scraper_regex": 706}}, "headline": "Pulse nightclub: Chilling 911 tapes capture killer's voice", "wordcount_as_scraped": 706, "date": "20161101050000", "story_content": "Pulse nightclub killer Omar Mateen sounded alternately angry, frazzled, evasive and condescending in nearly 30 minutes of phone conversations with an Orlando police negotiator.\n\nThough transcripts of the calls were already available, a judge decided Monday that audio of the 911 calls should be made public, providing the real-time sounds of a hostage crisis -- plus a chilling record of the killer's voice.\n\nMateen first made contact with police, calling 911 at 2:35 a.m. to say, \"I want to let you know I'm in Orlando and I did the shooting.\" When the dispatcher asked his identify, he said, \"My name is I pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi of the Islamic State.\" Then he hung up.\n\nThe negotiator stationed at the 911 center then called and got through three times to Mateen, who was inside the nightclub.\n\nMateen started out repeating phrases in an insistent, almost robotic manner.\n\nWhen the negotiator asked what was going on, meaning at the nightclub, Mateen replied, \"What's going on is that I feel the pain of the people getting killed in Syria and Iraq,\" a subject he returned to repeatedly.\n\nWhen the officer asked if he'd done something about it, Mateen said he had. The negotiator asked what and Mateen replied: \"You already know what I did.\"\n\nDressed for 'a wedding'\n\nThough he killed 49 people, Mateen never gave his real name -- identifying himself as \"Islamic soldier\" and \"soldier of the God\" -- or talked directly about the violence he inflicted, instead dropping hints while trying to steer the conversation to his grievances.\n\nWhen the negotiator tried to determine if Mateen was wearing a bomb vest, Mateen sarcastically replied that he was dressed \"to go out to a wedding.\" Later he mocked the officer's negotiating skills, saying, \"So what year did you graduate from the police academy?\" and called him \"homeboy.\"\n\nAnger seeped through when the final call began, with Mateen saying, \"You're annoying me with these phone calls and I don't really appreciate it.\" \n\n'It's my turn'\n\nMateen killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 on June 12 at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. It was the deadliest mass shooting in American history.\n\nTimeline of the Pulse massacre\n\nAt 2:48 a.m., the negotiator called Mateen for the first time. Identified only as Andy, the officer prodded Mateen to give information about himself, because police didn't know the identify of the caller or whether he was actually inside the nightclub. \n\nMateen provided this clue to his motivation: \"My homeboy Tamerlan Tsarnaev did his thing on the Boston Marathon, my homeboy (unidentified name) did his thing, OK, so now it's my turn, OK?\"\n\nHe told the officer he had a bomb vest and that several vehicles outside had bombs that could \"take out a whole city block almost.\"\n\nThe call lasted nine minutes.\n\nWhat triggered him?\n\nAt 3:03 a.m., police reached him again after calling back several times. In this 16-minute call he provided more of his motivation, saying, \"Yo, the airstrike that killed Abu Wahib a few weeks ago ... that's what triggered it, OK?\" \n\nWahib was a top ISIS leader killed in May by a coalition airstrike in Iraq.\n\nThe last call, at 3:24 a.m., lasted about three minutes. By this time police had identified the caller and the negotiator addressed him as \"Omar.\" \n\nThe negotiator pressed, saying, \"I'm treating you like an adult. We need to stay in constant contact,\" and Mateen replied, \"No, no, no, no, no, no, no.\"  The call ended 30 seconds later.\n\nAt 5:53 a.m., police shot and killed Mateen, 29, during an operation to free hostages at the club. \n\nMore 911 calls\n\nMateen was a US citizen of Afghan descent who lived in Port St. Lucie, Florida. He was married and worked as a security guard. He entered the club as a customer on the night of June 11 and came back hours later with guns.\n\nAnother judicial decision must be made about the Pulse massacre.\n\nNews organizations want the city to release 911 calls that may have captured the sound of people dying inside the nightclub, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The city is opposing the release.\n\nThe judge said she would listen to the 232 calls before making a decision, the Sentinel reported.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.76569032669067, "HarmVice": 11, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 643, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.2320706972099997, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161101050000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.26594090202177, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/28/politics/space-war-us-military-preparations/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "US military prepares for the next frontier: Space war", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1154, "date": "20161129150000", "story_content": "Since man first explored space, it has been a largely peaceful environment.

China has launched the \"Shiyan\" -- equipped with a grappling arm that could snatch US satellites right out of orbit.\n\n\"We would absolutely be shocked if the US military were not on a war footing now based on what we see,\" said Paul Graziani, CEO of the civilian satellite tracker AGI. \n\nThese are not experimental weapons of the future, but weapons of today, already operating from Near Earth Orbit, just 100 miles up and home of the International Space Station, to Medium Earth Orbit at 12,500 miles, where the GPS satellites fly, all the way up to 22,000 miles in Geostationary Orbit, home of the nation's most sensitive military communications and nuclear early-warning satellites.\n\nHyten warned that adversaries will soon be able to threaten US satellites in every orbital regime. \n\n\"We have very good surveillance and intelligence capabilities, so we can see the threats that are being built,\" said Hyten. \"So we're developing capabilities to defend ourselves. It's really that simple.\"\n\nThe US Air Force Space Command was created in 1982 when Earth's orbit was less contested, and today has some 38,000 employees, an annual budget of nearly $8.9 billion, and 134 locations around the globe. The broader Pentagon space budget is $22 billion.\n\nAmong the units are the 50th Space Wing, a team of more than 8,000 people charged with monitoring US and foreign military satellites. For now, these space warriors are little more than spectators, watching and observing this new space battlefield with no ability to fire back.\n\nIn 2015, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work expressed his grave concern that the military was not \"ready to do space operations in a conflict that extends into space.\"\n\nHe was proven right when, months later, US space forces were overwhelmed in a mock attack on US military satellites.\n\nSo many took notice when, in April this year, Work vowed that the US would \"strike back\" if attacked in space -- strike back, he added, and \"knock them out.\"\n\n\"From the very beginning, if someone starts going after our space constellation, we're going to go after the capabilities that would prevent them from doing that,\" Work told CNN. \"Let me just say that -- having the capability to shoot the torpedo would be a good thing to have in our quiver.\"\n\nWork suggested a space equivalent of the depth charges US Navy warships dropped into the sea during World War II, setting off enormous explosions to fight off attack submarines. \n\n\"These satellites were built 15 years ago and launched during an era when space was a benign environment. There was no threat,\" said Lt. Gen. David Buck, Commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Space. \"Can you imagine building a refueler aircraft, or a jet for that matter, with no inherent defensive capabilities? So our satellites are at risk, and our ground infrastructure is at risk. And we're working hard to make sure that we can protect and defend them.\"\n\nSo far, such weapons remain in the conceptual category. But the US is quietly developing advanced capabilities that could, some day, have defensive or offensive missions in space.\n\nThese include the US Navy's Laser Weapons System, or LAWs, the US military's first operational laser weapon now deployed in the Persian Gulf on board the USS Ponce. The X-37b, a pilotless space drone resembling the space shuttle without windows or a cockpit, has already flown multiple missions to space and has space watchers and US adversaries wondering if it could be used as a weapon.\n\nStill, as Russia and China make rapid advances, some of the most senior military commanders are sounding the alarm that this is a war -- the next world war and the first to extend beyond the confines of Earth -- that America could lose.\n\n\"We'd be silly to say it's not a possibility,\" said Singer. \"What any defense (planner) will tell you is, don't look for the ideal outcome, plan for the worst day so that you can survive.\"\n\nWinning a space war means rethinking how the US wages war, and that rethinking is one our current military leaders and politicians are only just beginning to undertake.\n\nSo is the US moving quickly enough to respond to the new threats in space?\n\n\"I would say the answer was no,\" said Gen. William Shelton, former head of Space Command. \"Could we provide active defense of our own satellites? The answer's no.\" \n\nThe stakes couldn't be higher. How the US responds to this new threat could determine who wins the defining conflict of the 21st century.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been corrected to more accurately reflect the size, age and budget of the Pentagon's space efforts.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.82444620132446, "HarmVice": 20, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1108, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.7438432723399995, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 45, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161129150000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.090909090909999, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 4.06137184115523, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/11/politics/donald-trump-news-conference-fact-check/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 740, "scraper_regex": 1835}}, "headline": "Trump news conference: CNN's Reality Check team vets the claims", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1835, "date": "20170111200000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday held his first news conference since winning the election, and CNN's Reality Check Team vetted his statements.\n\nThe team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the event and analyzed key statements, rating them true, misleading or false.\n\nRussia ties\n\nReality Check: Sean Spicer says Trump does not know Carter Page\n\nBy Kate Grise, CNN\n\nTrump and his aides are denying new reports of the President-elect's possible ties to Russia. Carter Page is a former Trump adviser whose reportedly close ties to Russia have been called into question during the campaign. The FBI looked into allegations that, while in Russia last year, Page had meetings related to individuals under US sanctions. \n\n\"Carter Page is an individual whom the President-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign,\" Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, said Wednesday.\n\n Trump, however, does at least know Page's name.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post editorial board in March, Trump named \"Carter Page, Ph.D.,\" as one of the people he was considering for his foreign policy team.  \n\nOn March 21, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed those people, including Page, to CNN.\n\nPage founded an investment company, Global Energy Capital, and has worked as an investment banker in London and Moscow.     \n\nPage has denied the allegations that he met with sanctioned Russian officials, telling The Washington Post, \"All of these accusations are just complete garbage.\"\n\nHe told The New York Times in March he had been sending policy memos to the campaign.\n\nIn a September appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said Page was no longer involved in the campaign and \"not authorized\" to speak with Russian officials on behalf of the Trump campaign.\n\nIt's unclear whether Trump knows Page personally, but it's evident Page was involved in the campaign as an early adviser. We rate Spicer's claim that Trump does not know Page misleading and his claim that Page was \"put on notice\" as true.\n\nReality Check: Trump has no deals in Russia\n\nBy Lisa Rose, CNN\n\nTrump claimed he has no business ties with Russia, and punctuated his point by declaring that if he wanted to build in Russia, he could effortlessly find partners for a venture.\n\n\"I have no deals in Russia,\" Trump said. \"I have no deals that could happen in Russia because we've stayed away. ... We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to. I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict.\" \n\nIt would be much easier to verify Trump's claim if his tax returns were public information. But because he hasn't turned over his IRS records, we'll have to look at prior comments he's made and news stories about his international business interests. \n\nAs recently as 2013, the President-elect was negotiating a deal with Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire, to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, according to a Washington Post investigation. \n\nAgalarov told the Post that although the plan to bring the Trump brand to Moscow didn't pan out, he hoped his family can partner with the Trumps at some point in the future.\n\nWhile Trump claimed that it would be a piece of cake to build one of his signature monoliths in Moscow, he has been trying unsuccessfully to cut a deal in Russia for three decades. \n\nIn 1987, he visited the Soviet Union with his first wife, Ivana, and announced plans to develop a luxury hotel there. Nine years later, he filed paperwork to trademark the name Trump Tower in Russia and subsequently registered other business names such as Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Home, according to a CNN Money report. \n\n\"Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment,\" Trump said during a 2007 court deposition. \"We will be in Moscow at some point.\"    \n\nTrump's declaration that he and his company have stayed away from Russia is also dubious. He journeyed to Moscow in 2013 for the Miss Universe pageant, schmoozed with a clutch of oligarchs at a nightspot and ultimately collected $14 million from Russians who invested in the beauty contest, according to The Washington Post. \n\nTrump's son, Donald Jr., made a half dozen business trips to Russia in 2007 and 2008 on behalf of the Trump Organization, according to the travel industry publication eTurboNews.\n\n\"In terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York,\" Trump Jr. said in the eTurboNews story. \"We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\"\n\nIndeed. The President-elect earned nearly $100 million when he sold a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch named Dmitry Rybolovlev in 2008. During a press conference in July, Trump said that the sale of the mansion was his one and only link to Russia.\n\n\"That was a number of years ago,\" Trump said at the July press conference. He then conceded, \"I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, OK?\"\n\nIt is true that there are no Trump-branded properties under construction in Moscow or elsewhere in the country but there is no way to verify the President-elect's claim that he is completely clear of business links to Russia without seeing his tax returns. His statement that Russia doesn't interest him is in contrast with decades of business trips and talk of grand plans for Moscow. \n\nHis remarks aren't outright false but we cannot give his claims the green light because he hasn't disclosed his tax returns. Our verdict: misleading.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nReality Check: Trump says US most vulnerable to cyberattack\n\nBy Jen Christensen, CNN\n\nTrump said the US government \"is the worst\" when it comes to the nation's vulnerability in being hacked.\n\n\"If you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries -- they put this in a category of an industry -- the United States is last in terms of protecting, let's say hacking defense,\" he said.\n\nThat claim is true, according to a 2016 US government cybersecurity report from SecurityScorecard. \n\nWhen compared to 17 entities, including private retail and health care, the startup ranks the US government at the very bottom. The government is vulnerable to hacking, the report suggests, as it struggles with overall network security issues, software patching problems and malware infections. The problem, in part, stems from the large size of federal agencies; however, the report says, the upside is that those agencies may have larger budgets and larger security teams to deal with a hack attack.\n\nHacking has been a problem for the US government before. In July 2015, thieves stole data from Office of Personnel Management computer systems that included Social Security numbers of over 21.5 million people.\n\nPresident Barack Obama addressed the issue at a news conference last month.\n\n\"Our economy is more digitized, it's more vulnerable, partly because we're a wealthier nation and we're more wired than other nations,\" Obama said.\n\nCORRECTION: This Reality Check has been updated to clarify the number of entities ranked by SecurityScoreboard.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nReality Check: 'No conflict of interest' for president, Trump says\n\nBy Eve Bower, CNN\n\nRepeating a claim he has made several times in recent weeks, Trump appeared certain when he said, \"I have a no-conflict-of-interest provision as president.\" \n\nSpecifically, he added, \"I could actually run my business and run government at the same time.\"\n\nThe reality is much less clear-cut. Though there are a number of laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest for other public servants -- and do not apply to the President -- there are other constitutional and federal statutory provisions that may indeed be interpreted to restrict the business dealings of the President. \n\nNine such provisions were recently outlined in a memo from the Congressional Research Service. The provisions include both restrictions on gifts and other benefits the president may receive and financial disclosure requirements.\n\nOne key question concerns a part of the Constitution known as the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits the president from receiving gifts from foreign governments. Because courts have not interpreted this provision in detail, it is unclear whether the various interests of the Trump Organization could become a conflict for the President-elect.\n\nBecause the truth is far more nuanced and uncertain than Trump portrays it to be, we rate this claim misleading.\n\nEmployment\n\nReality Check: Trump on 96 million out of the job market\n\nBy Patrick Gillespie and Tami Luhby, CNN\n\nTrump cited a false statistic to cast the job market as weaker than it truly is.\n\n\"Ninety-six million really wanting a job and they can't get. You know that story. The real number. That's the real number,\" he said in defense of his plan to implement a border tax to keep American companies from moving jobs outside the US.\n\nHere's the real deal on that stat: Some 93.8 million people are not in the labor force, but the vast majority of them don't want a job, according to the most recent quarterly data from the Atlanta Federal Reserve. Some 44 million are retired, 15.3 million are disabled, 13.3 million are taking care of a family member and another 13.2 million are in college or job training. They are listed as not wanting a job.\n\nIn addition, about 1.8 million are listed as marginally attached -- people who are not in the labor force who have looked for a job sometime in the past year -- and nearly 4.1 million are not marginally attached but want a job.\n\nSome economists argue that the official unemployment figure -- 7.5 million in December -- understates the true state of the job market because it only counts people who are out of a job and have looked for work in the past four weeks.\n\nWhat is the 'real' unemployment rate?\n\nA wider measure of unemployment includes people who've left the labor force but want a job, and part-timers who want full-time positions. Altogether, these three types of job-seekers total about 16 million, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nBecause 16 million is a far cry from 96 million, we rate Trump's claim as false.\n\nTax returns\n\nReality Check: Americans 'don't care at all' about Trump's tax returns, he says\n\nBy Daniella Diaz and David Wright, CNN\n\nTrump insisted that Americans \"don't care at all\" about his unreleased tax returns.\n\nTrump was asked if he would release his tax returns to prove that he doesn't have business and financial ties to Russia that could be used as leverage against him. \n\n\"I'm not releasing the tax returns because, as you know, they're under audit,\" he said.\n\nTrump's comments are directly contradicted by most major public polls on the issue. A CNN poll from October found that 73% of registered voters surveyed think Trump should release his tax returns for public review, including about half of Republicans at 49%.\n\nWe rate Trump's claim as false.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.37922406196594, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 740, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.4995867427, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.2972972972972996, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/politics/tim-ryan-nancy-pelosi-leadership-race-democrats/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 869, "scraper_regex": 1064}}, "headline": "Pelosi challenger steps up criticism ahead of leadership fight", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1064, "date": "20161128210000", "story_content": "Rep. Tim Ryan is accusing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of seeking to \"further consolidate her power\" as he tries to stoke antipathy over her long tenure as the Democratic leader ahead of this week's leadership elections.\n\nRyan, an Ohio Democrat in his seventh term, is mounting an uphill battle to defeat Pelosi in the Wednesday elections, seizing on the Democrats' disappointing election results and continued status in the House minority to call for changes at the top of his caucus.\n\nWho is Tim Ryan?\n\nWhile Pelosi remains a prohibitive favorite, she has taken a series of steps aimed at easing House Democratic concerns that rank-and-file members -- particularly those elected in recent elections -- have little influence over the messaging and strategy. So Pelosi has sent two letters to her colleagues laying out a series of changes she'd like to make, including giving more junior members a bigger say at the leadership table.\n\nAnd on Monday evening after Ryan publicly criticized Pelosi, she sent a third letter, telling her caucus she would bring a freshman Democrat into the leadership ranks while putting off an idea that irked at least one member of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nBut Ryan said Pelosi's initial changes did not go far enough.\n\n\"I am very disappointed in Leader Pelosi's proposed caucus reforms which are seemingly designed to further consolidate her power over the caucus,\" Ryan said in a Monday statement. \"There is a clear desire among our members to democratize the Democratic Caucus by returning more power to our rank and file members.\"\n\nPelosi's office declined to respond to Ryan's criticism, but the Monday letter seemed designed to respond to some of her challenger's attacks.\n\nRyan says Pelosi should change how Democrats select the leadership of the House Democrats' main campaign arm -- the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- to give members more say in influencing the direction of the group. And Ryan is seizing on criticism leveled by Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond -- a prominent member of the Congressional Black Caucus -- who privately told his CBC colleagues over the Thanksgiving holiday that some of Pelosi's changes could have \"severe unintended consequences that could diminish our power within the Democratic Caucus.\"\n\n\"We must continue our efforts to democratize the caucus and decentralize the power of the Democratic leader so each member of our caucus plays a role in our future path,\" Ryan said.\n\nRyan has just seven public endorsements, with the latest from Alcee Hastings of Florida, whose office told CNN Monday he's backing the Ohio Democrat for the job. While Pelosi has said confidently she has the support of two-thirds of the caucus, Ryan's aides said that the race is much closer, especially since a secret ballot election gives members a chance to vote their will without fear of repercussion.\n\nPelosi has been resistant in the past to diffusing the power of the leadership, but under increasing pressure from members who have pushed for specific changes she announced her support for some proposals to provide more opportunities for more junior members to serve in senior committee posts or newly created leadership positions. \n\nShe proposed that the current third-ranking position, called the \"assistant leader\" position that is now held by South Carolina Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, be switched to an elected position awarded to members who have served fewer than three terms. \n\nPelosi created the job after Democrats lost control of the House in 2010 and gave it to Clyburn, a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, who worked as the chief vote counter. Now she says that job should be held by a member who has been in Congress fewer than three terms -- after Clyburn leaves office. After criticism from the CBC members, Pelosi said Monday she would shelve discussion about the proposal to elect an assistant Democratic leader until a later time.\n\n\"Since the proposal addressing the Assistant Democratic Leader position is one that does not apply to this Congress, any further discussion should occur through the Committee on Organization, Standard and Review,\" Pelosi told her colleagues.\n\nFollowing the 2014 midterms, Pelosi added a position to the leadership team to focus on message development.  She tapped New York Democratic Rep. Steve Israel for that job, but she says she wants that post expanded to go to three \"co-chairs\" and suggests they should be drawn from those who have been in the House for less than 10 years. \n\nOn Friday, Pelosi nominated Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a rising star from the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Cheri Bustos from Illinois and Rep. Matt Cartwright from Pennsylvania to be the new co-chairs for this effort in the next Congress.\n\nShe also tapped California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, already a close ally of hers who led an effort to reach millennial voters, as a co-chair of the internal group that determines committee assignments for House Democrats.\n\nAs a way to boost profiles of younger members on various committees, Pelosi is proposing that each panel add a \"vice chair\" with the requirement that those be given to members who have served less than four terms in the House.\n\nA senior Democratic aide said the Pelosi proposals were not a final decision made by the minority leader -- and would only serve as a basis of future discussions within the Democratic Caucus.\n\nThere was grumbling within the caucus that Pelosi's plans still did not give enough say to freshman members. So on Monday evening, Pelosi also proposed including a freshman in leadership discussions.\n\nStill, Pelosi's move has irked at least one member of the influential CBC. In a letter last week to his colleagues, Richmond said that such proposals could hurt veteran members -- including many in the CBC -- who currently hold just one leadership position. Moreover, he raised concerns over Pelosi's proposal to turn the assistant leader position into an elected leadership spot for a more junior member -- given that it is currently held by Clyburn, the veteran CBC member.\n\n\"We must make sure that we do not send the message that, of the top three leaders, the assistant leader bears the blame for the losses,\" Richmond said.\n\nRyan seized on that criticism in his statement Monday.\n\n\"That is why my proposed reforms would not change this position, but instead add to the current leadership team a new elected position reserved for members with three terms or less,\" Ryan said.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.6163792610168501, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 869, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 33, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 9.52508649448, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 33, "mft_sum": 44, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161128210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.06329113924051, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/16/opinions/trump-following-authoritarian-playbook-ben-ghiat/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 806, "scraper_regex": 849}}, "headline": "Trump is following the authoritarian playbook", "wordcount_as_scraped": 849, "date": "20170116210000", "story_content": "In less than a week, America will embark on a new political experience: rule by an authoritarian President. Donald Trump won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million. So, for every American who looks forward to the Trump era, there is likely another who fears he will lead us into ruin. \n\nWhat can we expect from Donald Trump, based on his words and actions over the 19 months since he declared his candidacy? \n\nMany Americans were initially confused by Trump and his unorthodox behavior, or dismissed him as a joke. I have spent decades studying authoritarian and fascist regimes and saw in Trump a deeply familiar figure: the strongman who cultivates a bond with followers based on loyalty to him as a person rather than to a party or set of principles. \n\n Such individuals inevitably seek to adapt the political office they inhabit to serve their needs. They are clear from the start about this intention, refusing to submit to shared customs and norms -- such as releasing tax returns -- that would mean they were submitting to the will of the political class. Anyone who believes that Trump will morph into anything resembling a traditional politician will be sorely disappointed. Authoritarians never pivot. \n\nHe has been open and unconcerned about his most provocative character traits -- his penchant for aggression and for serial untruths -- from the start of his campaign. Two years ago, he boasted that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose any voters -- and voters still rewarded him with the GOP nomination and the presidency. What incentive does he have to change now?  \n\nTrump has followed the authoritarian playbook in targeting the media. And once in power he's very likely to step up his attempts at intimidation. \n\nStrongmen show aggression to the press as part of a slow-drip strategy of discrediting all information that is not dispensed by their close allies.  Many were surprised at Trump's rude treatment of CNN at his recent press conference. Calling the media outlet \"fake news,\" he refused to allow reporter Jim Acosta to ask a question. This was classic authoritarian posturing. \n\nTrump was delivering a lesson: anyone, no matter how powerful, can be humiliated and deprived of access if they displease him. No wonder Trump's Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan praised him for putting Acosta \"in his place.\" \n\nWe can hope that Trump does not follow Erdogan's criminalization of the media (thousands of Turkish journalists have been arrested). But recall the fencing-off of journalists at Trump's campaign rallies and his incitement of the crowd to treat them in a hostile manner. This does not bode well. The media must push back strongly now or pay a heavy price later. \n\nStrongmen also target the judiciary, since it stands in the way of their \"reforms\" that often veer into extra-legality. Those with a history of legal troubles can be particularly focused on this sector. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose conflicts of interest and legal involvements were so numerous that they have their own Wikipedia pages, spent enormous energy attacking the Italian judiciary. \n\nTrump, too, has a complicated legal history -- and has demonstrated a similarly vindictive character. \n\nSo look forward to Trump administration efforts to tar individual judges who seem to block the fulfillment of GOP agendas or interfere with Trump's personal interests. Remember the President-elect's campaign to discredit Judge Gonzalo Curiel due to his Mexican heritage? We can expect more such accusations of bias, and rhetoric about \"draining the swamp\" of our legal system as well. \n\nOne more thing: Authoritarians love to think they are making history, and never hesitate to rewrite the past to suit their political agendas. Trump's use of racism as a campaign tool laid the foundations for what will be a concerted effort to delegitimize the history of civil rights struggles in our country. \n\nTrump often levies tweet-attacks on those who criticize him, but his denigration of Representative John Lewis on the Martin Luther King holiday weekend sends a message that he intends to fulfill promises to his white voters to try and reverse the course of racial emancipation. \n\n \"Be courageous or be complicit,\" Representative Cedric Richmond recently stated in his testimony against Senator Jeff Sessions. The Trump administration promises to test that wisdom. \n\nEach of us can stand our ground in our own way, but the lessons that come to us from a century of authoritarian rule around the world -- and the civil rights movement in America -- meet up in one phrase: Do not lose hope. Do not hide away. Be visible and be heard, on the street and in phone calls to your elected officials.  \n\nSome of us have taken our freedoms for granted. We now have a reason to value them all the more.

These weren't conjurers who worked for tourists, but the magicians who performed for locals. We spent the nights in fairly nice hotels, but the days we spent on the streets in real Egypt, real China and real India.\n\nBefore this trip, we'd never considered ourselves overly patriotic; we never really thought about it. But we landed back in the USA feeling that John Wayne was a bit too hippie for our taste. Nothing can make you love the USA more than overseas travel.\n\nWhen we got back to doing our own magic show at our own theater in Las Vegas, we wanted to do a new magic trick that would express our newly-understood patriotism. We wanted to publicly salute the American flag and the republic for which it stands.\n\nOverseas, we saw poverty, disease and injustice, but what really struck us, what made us kiss the ground at McCarran airport in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States of America, was freedom. Freedom was what those other countries were so sorely lacking --  freedom that we must never take for granted.\n\nWe decided to do a magic trick that would celebrate the freedoms we could now taste so intensely. One of the standard plots in magic is a restoration. You rip, cut, tear or burn something and restore it into one piece.\n\nUsually a restoration means nothing but sleight of hand skill. You borrow a handkerchief, put in a rolled up piece of paper, burn it up, and then \"abracadabra\" it's back!  It's a miracle for no reason.\n\nBut what if instead of a handkerchief that meant nothing, we used a piece of cloth that was nothing but meaning?  What if we used the flag of the United States of America?  And what if instead of a meaningless piece of paper to wrap it in, we wrapped it in first 10 amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America, the Bill of Rights?\n\nWhat if, instead of \"abracadabra,\" we used a verse of \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" and what if the magic power the audience would cheer for was the freedom to burn the very flag that we loved so dearly? What if the magic of freedom restored the burnt flag?\n\nEvery night in our show we burned an American flag and then, with the celebration of freedom of speech, we made it reappear, whole, waving high on its flagpole. We did that trick thousands of times live for a couple million people, and every performance my eyes teared up just a little bit.\n\nMany veterans and other patriots told us after the show it was their favorite magic trick. We didn't kid ourselves; carny trash like Penn & Teller don't deserve that kind of reaction. These people were cheering freedom.\n\nWithout the right to burn the flag, without that freedom of expression, the flag is just a piece of cloth. It means nothing. With that freedom, with our Bill of Rights, it's the greatest symbol on earth. It's magic.\n\nFor the TV show \"The West Wing\" we performed our flag burning trick at the fictional first daughter's birthday party. Within the plot of the show, some people didn't understand our passionate magic trick. They didn't understand that it was a celebration of freedom, and they demanded to know whether we'd burned a flag in the White House.\n\nThe fictional president stuck up for us and explained that the Supreme Court and the Founding Fathers knew that for the flag to be revered, it must stand for real freedom.\n\nDo we really burn a flag in that trick? Do we symbolically burn the flag? Or do we vanish the flag in a patriotic flash of fireworks? It doesn't matter at all. The flag burning trick is a celebration of American freedom any way you look at it.\n\nMaybe some people don't understand what really makes this country great. Maybe they think it's a crime if Penn & Teller burned a flag on national TV.  Maybe some people will think that we should go to jail, or lose our citizenship, for a patriotic magic trick.\n\nI sure hope no one misunderstands our simple message because I promise you that although many other Americans love this country as much as I do -- no one loves it more.

Food, fuel and medical supplies are almost exhausted with no safe route out.\n\nOne activist in eastern Aleppo told CNN as many as 200,000 people -- including rebels and their families -- were crammed into 10 rebel-held neighborhoods, some having fled from other areas under fire.\n\nHe described the situation as \"apocalyptic,\" saying the few hospitals still operating were packed with injured civilians and resembled \"slaughterhouses,\" with no medical supplies or proper facilities.\n\nDozens of people have been killed daily in the strikes and crossfire between the regime and rebels since the Syrian forces began their push into eastern Aleppo on November 26, activist groups said.\n\nThough their territory is shrinking, rebels are also inflicting losses.\n\nAt least 12 civilians were killed and 64 others wounded Wednesday in rebel shelling of government-held neighborhoods in western Aleppo, Syrian state media reported.\n\nThe report said rebels fired dozens of rockets on residential neighborhoods and that the death toll was expected to rise.  \n\nFleeing Syrians line up at crossing\n\nHundreds of exhausted Syrians pushing carts and carrying suitcases and plastic bags filled with their life's possessions waited Wednesday morning for buses to take them from eastern to western Aleppo.\n\nSome who spoke to CNN in the Agheour area, by the main Maysaloon crossing, described appalling conditions -- days gripped by hunger and fear of airstrikes.\n\nA CNN crew saw 25 people cross on foot in 20 minutes, with more coming all the time, while others waited for buses to the town of Jibreen, on the southeastern outskirts of Aleppo, where many of those fleeing are being housed.\n\nA Syrian commander told CNN that more than 2,000 people had passed through the Maysaloon crossing point since 10 Tuesday night. \n\n\"We have suffered a lot,\" said a man in his early 60s who was traveling with eight relatives and asked not to be named.\n\n\"We've been deprived of food -- the amount of bread we were being given wasn't enough to feed my family,\" he said. \"My vision has been affected by the lack of food.\"\n\nHis family received one loaf of bread between two people every three days, which wasn't enough to feed them, he said. \n\nShrapnel from an airstrike hit one of his sons, but the man said he was mainly concerned that family members would starve if they stayed in eastern Aleppo.\n\nThe CNN crew also saw Syrian soldiers carrying old and weak people out of Agheour. There were also families with small infants, the youngest a girl named Ghazal who was 7 days old. Two men helped carry an elderly woman on a chair.\n\nRebel forces controlled the Agheour area for at least 3\u00bd years before it was retaken by Syrian government forces Tuesday night.\n\nUNICEF said in a statement Wednesday that some 31,500 people had been displaced from eastern Aleppo in 10 days. Estimates indicate at least half are children, it said.\n\nA joint statement Wednesday by the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Britain and the United States called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" and condemned the Syrian regime and Russia for their actions in Aleppo.\n\nIt called on the United Nations to hold accountable those who have committed \"war crimes\" and said \"only a political settlement can bring peace for people in Syria.\"\n\nWhile it is difficult to estimate how many people are still in eastern Aleppo, according to the statement some 200,000 civilians -- including many children -- are cut off from food and medical supplies there.\n\nOpinion: After Aleppo falls, Syria's bloodshed may continue\n\nResident: Death better than fleeing to regime\n\nAbdulkafi al-Hamdo, a teacher and father of a 9-month-old baby, is one of those trapped in the remaining rebel-held area under heavy bombardment.\n\n\"I get up (to) the sound of planes, feeling cold, not finding suitable food for breakfast and no clean water to drink. I go out to see my people in pain and fear,\" he told CNN via text message.\n\nMany people \"are dying without finding someone to bury them,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he and his family would leave, he replied, \"Where? Regime area? Death is much better. How can we go back to someone who killed our brothers, sisters and children?\"\n\nHamdo said his wife could no longer breast-feed and their baby is hungry and crying all the time. They feed her some crushed rice and bread dipped in tea, he said.\n\nIntense, continuous shelling\n\nActivists inside besieged eastern Aleppo told CNN that heavy artillery shelling and airstrikes were pounding the area Wednesday. The shelling is intense and doesn't show any signs of ceasing, they said.\n\nActivists with the Aleppo Media Center said the regime \"was able to capture the neighborhood of Tareeq al-Bab after capturing al-Muwasalt neighborhood, as well as al-Shaar, Karm al-Jabal and several neighborhoods in the old city of Aleppo such as Bab al-Hadeed, Agheour, Bab al-Nasser, al-Bayada and Qadi Askar\" after rebel forces withdrew.\n\nAleppo Media Center activists said regime forces had reached the Citadel in the old city of Aleppo but not the main gate.\n\nRebels call for humanitarian ceasefire\n\nRebels in eastern Aleppo have called for an immediate five-day humanitarian ceasefire and for the evacuation of about 500 emergency cases under UN supervision, according to a statement released in the name of the Aleppo City Leadership Council. \n\nThe rebel group urges any civilians who wish to leave Aleppo be allowed to flee to the northern countryside, calling the northwestern province of Idlib \"not a safe area\" due to recent airstrikes on towns and villages.\n\n\"Once the humanitarian situation has been alleviated in Aleppo city, the parties concerned can negotiate the future of the city,\" the statement said.\n\nThe state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Wednesday that the Syrian army had \"restored security and stability\" to more than a dozen Aleppo neighborhoods in the past two days. It also said repairs had begun on the Aleppo airport road after the Syrian army captured the area.\n\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces are backed by Russia, has said \"terrorists\" must be driven out to protect civilians.\n\nUN resolution vetoed\n\nRussia and China on Monday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Aleppo to allow desperately needed aid into the war-ravaged zone.\n\nThe United Nations has repeatedly called for safe passage for its humanitarian staff, but it said the Syrian government and Russia have failed to guarantee it.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry reported Wednesday that a Russian military officer, Col.

From the moment the blue wall crumbled and formerly safe states flipped to Donald Trump, the left has had a tenuous grasp on political reality. Rather than accepting that Trump will be the President on January 20, many have instead jumped from one desperate strategy to another in an effort to overturn the will of the American voters. \n\nIt began with Jill Stein's ill-conceived recount, a more than $7 million boondoggle that ended up netting more votes for the President-elect. Some on the left then turned to an unseemly campaign,  ranging from celebrity videos to threats of violence, to persuade electors to ignore the voters in their states and cast their ballots for someone, anyone, other than Donald Trump. \n\nWith these efforts failed and Trump's inauguration but days away, Democrats have taken up a new strategy: They will cripple the American government before they'll see Donald Trump lead it. \n\nAs reported in the Washington Post,  Democratic Party leaders, well aware that they lack the votes in the Senate to defeat Trump's Cabinet choices, have vowed to delay them for as long as possible, saying they want to see more information from the nominees on their personal finances. If successful, Democrats may prevent Trump from filling critical posts in government, from secretary of state to the United States attorney general, until March or beyond. \n\nThis strategy is an \"unprecedented break with Senate tradition.\" Certainly, Republicans and Democrats have been guilty of holding up confirmation hearings for nominees before, but this tactic usually comes into play later in an administration. Both parties, no matter how contentious the election and no matter how disliked the victor, have refused to put the continuity of government at risk over petty partisanship. One need look no further back than 2009 for an example of this principle in action.  \n\nBefore Barack Obama even stepped foot in the Oval Office, Republican leaders vowed to oppose much of his agenda. But when President Obama nominated Eric Holder for attorney general, Republicans gave him a vote and he was confirmed on February 2.   The Senate confirmed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state on January 21, the day after President Obama took the oath of office. \n\nRepublicans could have pulled any number of parliamentary tricks to delay the confirmation of two people whom they had every reason to oppose. But they didn't, and for good reason. The secretary of state and attorney general are two of the most important positions in government. The first is responsible for our nation's foreign policy, the second for upholding the rule of law. \n\nEnsuring that the men and women nominated to fill these and other Cabinet positions are qualified is one of the Senate's primary tasks, one enshrined in the Constitution itself. And Democrats should do their job. Ask tough questions. Hold thorough hearings. And if necessary, vote against the nominees. \n\nBut to delay the swift and orderly transition of government out of pure petty partisanship should be unacceptable to Democrats and Republicans alike. And that is exactly what Senate Democrats are threatening to do. Allowing the ship of state to run adrift or for the nation's chief law enforcement agency to go without a leader is shameful, but worse than that, it threatens American lives both at home and abroad. \n\nLosing is never easy, and losing this election was certainly harder than most. So Democrats can be forgiven for overreacting. But some tantrums go too far. Donald Trump will be president. Nothing is going to change that fact. And if Democrats don't realize that soon, the results of the 2018 election may be even more difficult for them to swallow.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.148784160614009, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 632, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.99171839093, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.16455696202532, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/16/politics/kfile-monica-crowley-huma-abedin/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Trump national security pick Monica Crowley repeatedly pushed conspiracy theory about Clinton aide ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 669, "date": "20161216180000", "story_content": "Fox News analyst Monica Crowley, Donald Trump's pick to be senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council, repeatedly pushed an unfounded conspiracy theory that claimed Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin has ties to Islamic extremists. \n\nThe claim, which circulated among far-right websites, has been labeled as false and unfounded by fact-checkers from the Washington Post, Politifact, and Snopes.\n\nClaims Abedin was tied to the Muslim Brotherhood are based on flimsy connections tying together people and events from decades ago. Crowley made the charge in radio appearances, columns, and on Fox News over the years, a CNN KFile review found. \n\nThe claims have also been strongly rebutted by high profile Republicans. Former House Speaker John Boehner called the accusations  \"pretty dangerous\" and then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers called Abedin an \"American patriot.\" The allegations received a passionate rebuke from Republican Sen. John McCain on the Senate floor.\n\nStill, Crowley pushed it repeatedly. An email seeking comment sent to a Trump transition spokesperson, Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, and Crowley was not immediately returned.\n\nIn a 2013 exchange on Fox News's \"Hannity,\" Crowley responded to another panelist who claimed ties between Abedin and the Muslim brotherhood by saying, \"That's the real Huma Abedin story. It's not about Weiner's Weiner. It's about Huma Abedin and her ties to Islamic extremists.\"\n\nIn another instance, in January of this year, Crowley praised Frank Gaffney of the far-right fringe think-tank Center for Security Policy for his efforts in investigating Abedin.\n\n\"One of whom I've been very concerned about, as I know have you, Huma Abedin, the woman who was tied extensively through personal, as well as family, relations with the Muslim Brotherhood, among other things,\" said Gaffney on his radio program. \"There's a new movie that will be coming out shortly about the Weiners, her husband and Huma, and I just wonder what you make of her role in all of this as so far we can determine it.\"\n\nCrowley responded, saying, \"Well, what we do know, at least so far, we've known for years Frank,  that Huma Abedin is Mrs. Clinton's closest and most trusted aide, apart from Bill, we know that to be true. You have done yeoman's work in investigating her background, her family's background, in terms of links to the Muslim Brotherhood and Muslim Sisterhood. That exists.\"\n\nOn her personal website, Crowley has also linked to stories about the conspiracy, writing on her blog, \"the REAL Huma Abedin story, involving her and her family's ties to Islamic supremacists.\" In one column last year, Crowley said Abedin's family had \"alleged ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.\"\n\nIn August of this year, Crowley said on \"Hannity\" that Abedin's parents were \"essentially tools of the Saudi regime,\" and an academic journal they published was designed to spread sharia to the West. The Washington Post reported, however, the journal was \"a sober academic journal with a range of viewpoints on Muslim life around the world.\n\n\"There are two really big points about Huma Abedin and this Institute for Muslim minority affairs and the journal she was on the masthead of,\" said Crowley. \"One, 'Muslim Minority Affairs' does not refer to getting social welfare programs for Muslims who happen to be minorities, no. What it's about is preparing the Muslim minority to be the Muslim minority in places like the west and the United States. Number two, and this is really important because she referred to her family, her parents, along with the major Al Qaeda financier named Omar Naseef began this institute as a Saudi regime initiative.\"\n\n\"This was funded by the Saudi regime in order to spread Islam and sharia across the west, including in the United States,\" she continued. \"This is Huma Abedin's life's work. This is what her parents do. They're essentially tools of the Saudi regime in order to make this transition globally. So this is not an innocent journal.

The movement's narrative is simple: Whether Trump's election signals triumph or doom, America's most important next step is to reach out, embrace, and better understand the ignored, maligned and threatened white working class. Heralded by voices on both the left and right, the narrative explains Trump's victory, diagnoses Hillary Clinton's Electoral College loss, and prescribes how the nation should move forward. \n\nThe narrative supporting the new white wants us to accept four primary truths. The left's identity politics are too divisive. Liberal elites are too insular. Class -- not race -- anxieties animate today's white working-class frustration and fears. Finally, whether Trump maintains the new order, or the left overthrows it, we must invest our time and energy understanding white people. As much as this narrative might argue otherwise, however, the new white is the old white under different cover. If we allow their pleas to heap more attention on white America, black and brown Americans will find ourselves refighting the battles our civil rights forebears fought, rather than continuing our long march toward racial justice. \n\nOur present moment is strikingly similar to our past, and today's racial politics are just as troublesome as they were at the dawn of Reconstruction, when the power of race to spur white anxiety was most palpable. Take as an example the 1875 political cartoon in Harper's titled \"Colored Rule in a Reconstructed State.\" In it, Thomas Nast caricatured black legislators towering over cowering white counterparts with raised fists. The caption chastises them for \"aping the lowest whites.\" The message was clear. In a nation where whiteness and white people were the principal measure for good, good citizenship, and good governing, the idea of black rule was untenable. So what does this have to do with today's new white? Turns out, a lot. Both Nast's gambit and the narrative of the new white depend on strategies of old-fashioned white supremacy.  \n\nWhen the new white lumps together all liberals, leftists, Democrats and elites and rejects them, they take a tack from Thomas Nast. They essentially accuse nonwhites of aping the worst of white people. When Donald Trump asks African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans what the hell they have to lose by rejecting the lumped-together (white) liberals, he manages to call nonwhites stupid while calling liberal whites out for their myopia, as research shows that whites are more likely not to try to understand nonwhites than the other way around. \n\nWhen whites do interact with people with different views than themselves, more than half say they come away thinking they have less in common with the person. Significantly fewer blacks leave such conversations believing so. The simple fact is, the structure of everyday life in the United States practically dictates that many nonwhites must inhabit and socialize in white spaces. Blacks and Hispanics, more than whites, believe churches should be more diverse, and attend mostly white churches more than whites attend black and Hispanic churches. Blacks and Hispanics go to jobs every day in workplaces that are mostly white. \n\nEven Newt Gingrich has admitted, \"If you are a normal white American, the truth is you don't understand being black in America.\" By not distinguishing these failures by race, the new white narrative discredits nonwhites along with their white allies. By doing so it also minimizes and discredits the larger cause for which they fight, whether that cause be the 19th century's radical Reconstruction or the 21st century fight for racial justice.\n\nWe must see the new white narrative for what  it really is, an attempt to refocus public attention and political capital away from people of color. Trump and many of those he's chosen to lead his administration are the new white's principal ambassadors. They take stock of the last few years as blacks fought against police brutality, Muslims battled religious persecution, and Hispanics defended themselves and their families from mass deportations. These representatives of the new white respond: Your concerns don't matter as much as working-class folk (white people) for whom America's promise was designed but has been denied. \n\nThis is not new. \"Race\" was a concept applied originally to African slaves. Whites made Africans raced beings, and they saw themselves only as \"Americans.\" This sleight of hand allowed whites then and now to position themselves as \"normal\" and dismiss black and brown people's grievances as racially self-indulgent. When a majority of blacks vote for Obama, white people say race motivates them. When most white folks vote for Trump, Romney or Bush, they say those candidates' race doesn't matter. The new white narrative claims blacks and other people of color are blinded by race, while white people are race blind. This fallacy makes the new white's plea for attention seemingly justifiable. \n\nHistorian Mark Lilla claims that \"the fixation on diversity in our schools and in the press has produced a generation of liberals and progressives narcissistically unaware of conditions outside their self-defined groups.\" What he and others including Joan Williams, Michael Lerner, and Charles Camosy are really saying -- to Black Lives Matter activists and others pushing for racial progress -- is hold up. Slow down. Don't push too hard. Not yet. Stop what you're doing and think about the greater good, about America, about unity. Reach out and try to understand white people's grievances so that we can come together and govern together.\n\nWe've heard this clever distraction before. In the 1950s and 1960s and beyond, ardent racists and racial justice sympathizers alike slow-played civil rights. While the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. dismantled this rationale in the press and elsewhere, Nina Simone best captured the sentiment of King and others. \"I don't trust you any more,\" Simone scolds in \"Mississippi Goddam.\" \"You keep on saying 'Go slow!' Go slow!' But that's just the trouble. 'Do it slow.' Desegregation. 'Do it slow.' Mass participation. 'Do it slow.' Reunification. 'Do it slow.' Do things gradually. 'Do it slow.' But bring more tragedy'. Do it slow.' Why don't you see it? Why don't you feel it? I don't know. I don't know.\" \n\nBut white supremacy accomplishes its most insidious work by imposing one simple demand on those who fight for racial justice: Wait. When it comes to debunking the myth of the new white, we cannot and must not wait.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.64783763885498, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 999, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.90624861148, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 4, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161220190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.4034034034034, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/18/politics/obama-commutes-prison-oscar-lpez-rivera/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00f3": [34, 261, 533, 816, 1109, 1489, 1620, 1714, 2366, 3732, 3974, 4709, 6578, 6809, 6896, 6909, 7066], "\u00ed": [131, 5408, 6426]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 943, "scraper_regex": 1246}}, "headline": "Obama commutes FALN member Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera's prison sentence ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1246, "date": "20170118110000", "story_content": "[Editor's note: A prior version of this story called Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla the governor of Puerto Rico. He is a former governor.]\n\nPresident Barack Obama's commutation of the sentence of Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera, who was convicted for his role in a Puerto Rican nationalist group linked to bombings in US cities, ends a decades-long fight to free a man who supporters call a \"political prisoner.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officials have labeled him a terrorist since the 1970s.\n\nL\u00f3pez Rivera, who was serving more than 50 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the US government, belonged to Armed Forces of National Liberation, known by its Spanish acronym FALN. The group often fought for Puerto Rican independence through violence and was connel\n\nIn 1981, L\u00f3pez Rivera was sentenced to 55 years in prison for \"seditious conspiracy\" and other felonies. He was later sentenced to an additional 15 years in 1988 for conspiracy to escape; to transport explosives with intent to kill and injure people; and to destroy government buildings and property.\n\nL\u00f3pez Rivera wasn't charged directly in FALN's attacks but more broadly with charges of plotting to overthrow the US government.\n\nHis prison sentence was expected to expire in 2051, but he will walk free on May 17, 2017.\n\nMultiple groups, including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus and other elected officials lobbied the Obama administration for L\u00f3pez Rivera's release. \n\nMelissa Mark-Viverito, the New York City Council speaker who was among the politicians who advocated for L\u00f3pez Rivera's release, told CNN affiliate NY1 that the day was historic.\n\nMark-Viverito said L\u00f3pez Rivera's imprisonment for an \"unjust number of years\" was based solely on his political beliefs.\n\n\"He is a political prisoner,\" she added. \n\nObama's commutation reduces the sentence being served, but it does not change a conviction, whereas a pardon forgives a certain criminal offense.\n\nThe FALN had claimed responsibility for bombings in the 1970s.\n\nJoseph Connor, whose father Frank was one of four people killed in the January 1975 bombing of the historic Fraunces Tavern in Manhattan, called the commutation a \"travesty\" and \"disgraceful.\" \n\nJoseph Connor was 9 at the time of the lunch-hour attack -- for which FALN claimed responsibility. L\u00f3pez Rivera was not convicted in connection with the bombing. \n\n\"He's never shown any remorse for what he did,\" Connor said. \"We went to his parole hearing in 2011 and had he shown any contrition at all, had expressed any atonement, any sympathy, we would have been willing to forgive him and would have recommended that he be released. But he has shown none at all. He has no atonement and no contrition.\"\n\nHistory of attacks\n\nFALN first announced itself in 1974, when it took credit for five bombings in New York. \n\nThe group was responsible for dozens of bombings and incendiary attacks during the decade, according to law enforcement officials. The bombings were called terror attacks and resulted in at least five deaths and more than $3 million in property damage, according to a 1999 House report for the Committee on Government Reform.  \n\nIn one attack for which the group claimed responsibility, a booby-trapped body was used to lure a NYPD officer into an abandoned building. The resultant explosion permanently disabled the officer. \n\nThe statement taking credit for the attack warned:  \"(To) make it clear, for every repressive action taken against our communities or against FALN. independentistas, we will respond with revolutionary violence.''\n\nIn late 1976, Chicago police uncovered a bomb factory run by FALN, a discovery that led to the arrest of L\u00f3pez Rivera, the House report said. \n\nIn 1999, then-President Bill Clinton offered clemency to 16 FALN prisoners who had been incarcerated while fighting for an independent Puerto Rico through violent means. Fourteen accepted the offer, but L\u00f3pez Rivera was one of two prisoners who declined.\n\n\"None of them were convicted of doing bodily harm to anyone. And they had all served sentences that were considerably longer than they would serve under the sentencing guidelines which control federal sentencing now,\" Clinton said at the time.\n\n\"I did not believe they should be held in incarceration -- in effect -- by guilt by association,\" he said.\n\nClinton said he received petitions on behalf of the prisoners from hundreds of people, including former President Jimmy Carter, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, other religious leaders and congressmen.\n\nThe decision sparked strong criticism from law enforcement officials and some political leaders.\n\nSupporters celebrate\n\nL\u00f3pez Rivera's supporters include \"Hamilton\" writer and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda, who said he was \"sobbing with gratitude\" about the news. \n\n\"Sobbing with gratitude here in London.

Here are 5 key demands", "wordcount_as_scraped": 888, "date": "20161112070000", "story_content": "Demonstrations against President-elect Donald Trump are erupting across the United States.\n\nFrom New York to Atlanta to San Diego, thousands of people have taken to the streets. \n\nThe protests have been largely peaceful, but some have turned violent. In Portland, Oregon, police described one as a riot after vandals threw objects at officers and damaged cars.\n\nProtesters are raising a range of concerns as they take to the streets. But they seem to be standing together on several key points.\n\nHere are five things they're pushing for:\n\n1. 'Dump Trump'\n\nMany demonstrators have used \"Dump Trump\" as a rallying cry. \n\nWhat does that mean exactly? It's a slogan that first gained traction as some Republicans pushed for the party to cut ties with Trump. But now that the election results are in, it's taking on a different meaning. \n\nFor some, it's a catchy way to sum up their rage about the President-elect. But others are taking things a step further, signing an online petition and writing letters to members of the Electoral College, asking them not to vote the way their states did at the polls.  \n\nCould that happen? The Internet rumor debunking website Snopes.com describes the prospect as \"extremely, extremely unlikely,\" noting that it would be \"wholly unprecedented in American history and would require a sudden and drastic change in the United States' political traditions.\"\n\nThe Electoral College itself has also become a focus for some protesters, since Clinton won the popular vote but lost the election.\n\n2. Build bridges, not walls\n\nTrump made immigration a focal point of his campaign, and it's a key issue for many protesters who are against Trump's vows to deport undocumented immigrants. \n\n\"I'm out here for my undocumented friends,\" protester Spencer Smith, 19, told CNN in Atlanta.\n\nAt protests in Miami, demonstrators held signs that said, \"build bridges, not walls,\" taking aim at Trump's oft-touted plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.\n\nIs there any chance the wall plan could come off the table? Don't hold your breath, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, one of Trump's advisers on immigration, told CNN affiliate KWCH this week.\n\n\"There's no question the wall is going to get built,\" Kobach said. \"The only question is how quickly will it get done and who pays for it?\"\n\nWhether or not Trump heeds protesters' calls, building a wall along the border may be harder than it sounds.\n\n3. Making a statement\n\nSome protesters say they know Trump will take the reins January 20, but they want to make it clear that they're not happy about the election results -- and they're not going to be quiet about it.\n\nProtesters in Iowa this week had two main goals, said Rachel Walerstein, who attended protest in Iowa. First, they wanted to let people know that rhetoric-fueled violence against people of color, immigrants and LGBT people won't stand, she said. \n\n\"The second is to make a statement of political instability to render it difficult to govern, and in particular, to make it impossible for Trump to implement his policies in the first 100 days,\" she said. \"For me, it's important to make these statements known and visible.\"\n\n\"It's mostly to raise awareness,\" said Dalina Aim\u00e9e Perdomo, who also joined protests in Iowa City this week and said she felt angry and disappointed that her state had gone with conservative choices at the polls. \"We gathered to share how we felt and how our families felt.\"\n\nTrump has slammed protesters as \"paid professionals,\" but later praised their passion on Twitter.\n\nLove the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016\n\n4. Trump should denounce the divisive things he's said \n\n\"He needs to really address all the divisive, hateful things he's said in the past and recant them, denounce them,\" protester Nick Truesdale told CNN in New York on Friday.\n\nTrump told The Wall Street Journal this week that he doesn't think his rhetoric on the campaign trail went too far. But he also said he wanted people to come together, according to the newspaper.\n\n\"I want a country that loves each other,\" he told the Journal this week. \"I want to stress that.\"\n\nOthers have called for Trump to denounce an upcoming KKK parade scheduled to celebrate his victory in North Carolina.\n\nTrump himself hasn't spoken out publicly about the event, but the North Carolina Republican Party condemned it.\n\n5. 'Not my president'\n\nAcross the country, protesters have been waving signs that say \"not my president.\" \n\nOrganizers of a protest in Atlanta said their message is simple. \"We do not respect the fact that Trump is president of the United States,\" they wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"No to Trump and no to any future leaders who prey on our fear and lie to us plainly, be they dressed as friends or foes. No to a president that wants to ban all Muslims. No to a president who calls Mexicans rapists,\" the Facebook invite for an Atlanta protest says. \"No to rape culture. No to a president that not so subtly romanticizes white supremacy and mourns its loss though we all know it has been alive and well. No to leaders who propagate the destruction of our environment.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 6, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.11627912521362, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 785, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.17010832258, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161112070000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6942675159235696, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/04/europe/italian-referendum-beppe-grillo-profile/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Italian referendum: Who is Beppe Grillo?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 581, "date": "20161204140000", "story_content": "One of the benefactors of the political uncertainty created by the Italian Prime Minister's resignation is former comedian Beppe Grillo.\n\nNow leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S) party, the former funnyman campaigned for the \"no\" vote which won Sunday's referendum.\n\nAmong other measures, voters were asked to approve an overhaul of the country's legislative process, namely the Senate -- one of Italy's two chambers of parliament -- which would see its membership cut from 315 to 100, reducing much of its power. \n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Matteo Renzi lobbied hard for the changes, arguing they would benefit the country and help push his much-needed economic policies through Italy's bureaucratic red tape. \n\nThe resounding loss for Renzi now sets the stage for a general election -- and a possible win by Grillo's Five Star Movement (M5S) party.\n\nSo who is the leader of the anti-austerity M5S party and what does he stand for? \n\nRELATED: Visual guide to populism in Europe\n\nAn anti-establishment entertainer?\n\nGrillo, 68, founded the party in 2009 after making a name for himself on Italian TV in the 1970s and 1980s. He capitalized on his show-business bravado to promote an anti-establishment movement spanning both the left and right of politics.\n\n\"He's used to entertaining the public, so his speeches are also very entertaining,\" said Vincenzo Scarpetta, senior policy analyst at think tank Open Europe. \n\n\"Even if you don't speak Italian, if you watch his body language you can see he's always very expressive and entertaining -- he moves a lot, running back and forth on stage.\"\n\nGrillo has called for greater transparency in government, holding \"V-Day\" rallies -- short for an Italian expletive beginning with V -- which he says also invoke the revolutionary spirit of \"V for Vendetta.\" \n\n\"He's definitely a straight-talking guy,\" said Scarpetta.\n\nGrillo's party's politics may be harder to pin down.\n\n\"It's difficult to place the movement on the political spectrum, precisely because they have refused so far to be categorized as either left or right wing,\" Scarpetta added.\n\nWhat does Grillo stand for?\n\nEnding the euro: The party's flagship policy centers around Italy abandoning the euro. \"They have long promised to hold a referendum on Italy's membership of the single currency,\" said Scarpetta.\n\nOpposing free trade: M5S also opposes major free-trade deals between the European Union and US (known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership), and the EU and Canada (called the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement).\n\n\"In that sense, they would be much more protectionist on trade policy than the current government,\" Scarpetta said. \n\nLower taxes for the poor: \"The movement believes taxation for middle- and low-income people should go down, because these people have been stifled by successive governments raising tax,\" said Scarpetta.\n\nCould he really be Italy's next prime minister?\n\nEven if the M5S were to win a general election, Grillo -- who maintains a popular blog -- has long said he has no ambition to be prime minister.\n\nA 1980 manslaughter conviction from a car accident which killed three people has also thrown doubt over whether Grillo would even be eligible for the office.\n\nSo who from the party might be a candidate for the prime ministerial job? \n\n\"Luigi Di Maio is an obvious name,\" said Scarpetta, referring to the 30-year-old vice president of the Chamber of Deputies -- the other chamber of Italy's parliament.\n\n\"But remember this is also a movement that makes a big deal of transparency and accountability, selecting candidates by online surveys,\" he said. \"I'm inclined to think they may do the same again.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.32414910197258, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 557, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.05234880934, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161204140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.43626570915619, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/trump-wall-mexico-challenges/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1351, "scraper_regex": 1492}}, "headline": "The many challenges facing Trump's wall", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1492, "date": "20170125120000", "story_content": "President Donald Trump is following through with one of the first pledges he made a year and a half ago when he announced his long-shot bid for the White House -- directing federal resources toward building a wall along the southern border. \n\nBut the reality of building the wall could be more difficult than the rallying cries would suggest. The length of the wall, when construction will begin, how much it will cost and who will pay for it remain fundamental questions. \n\nThere is also ongoing debate about the feasibility of the structure and the need for it in the first place.\n\nTrump's push for a wall dates back to the day in June 2015 when he announced his campaign and promised to \"build a great, great wall on our southern border\" and said Mexico would pay.\n\n\"Mark my words,\" he said for added effect. \n\nHis effort to turn those words into reality is expected to be formally announced Wednesday and is among several immigration-related actions anticipated in a multi-day rollout from the new administration. \n\nSince he first made the pledge, walling off our neighbors to the south became an oft-repeated promise and rallying cry, both for the candidate and his supporters. Chants of \"build that wall\" thundered through arenas and convention halls. In at least one instance, Trump himself led the cheer. Building \"an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border, on day one\" is listed as item No. 1 on his \"10 Point Plan to Put America First.\"\n\nReality of building the wall\n\nAt the first press briefing of the new administration Monday, one of the first questions to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was about the wall. Spicer said the administration was working with agency heads and Congress to move forward on the project. He offered no further details.\n\nDonald Trump's immigration policy: Then and now\n\nNot everyone is as enthusiastic as the President about building a wall, including the man whose job it was to secure the U.S. border for the past three years.\n\n\"I don't see any efficacy in building a wall across the border,\" said Gil Kerlikowske, who until last week served as Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"The border and migration issues are just unbelievably complex,\" Kerlikowske said in an interview with CNN. \"And a simple answer to a complex problem is most assuredly the wrong answer.\"\n\nTrump has yet to appoint Kerlikowske's replacement.\n\nKerlikowske said the rugged terrain in the Arizona desert and the shifting Rio Grande River in Texas, which routinely changes depth and even direction, both represent natural obstacles to building a border wall. Some of the land along the border in the Rio Grande Valley is privately owned, representing another challenge, he said.\n\nKerlikowske also noted that the vast majority of people trying to enter the US are actually showing up at border entry points and seeking asylum or turning themselves in. Most are not trying to scale the fence in the dark of night, he said. Even if a wall was built, he said, it would require a significant hiring increase to have enough agents to monitor the wall. That would be no easy feat for an agency that is currently 1,200 employees below full strength.\n\nKerlikowske said that, in addition to some 700 miles of fencing, the border is currently patrolled by agents on foot, bikes, motorcycles, ATVs and horseback. There's also an air wing, unmanned predator drones, ground sensors, infrared video and tower-mounted video with a range of 25 miles.\n\n\"It's all preferable to a wall,\" Kerlikowske said. \"Unless you monitor that wall.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump told a crowd of supporters in Anaheim, California, in May that he'd reached out to leaders in the union representing Border Patrol agents and asked whether a wall was truly needed.\n\n\"Mr. Trump, It's absolutely vital,\" came the reply, he told the crowd. \"It's an absolutely important tool. Maybe our most important tool to stop what's going on.\"\n\nBuilding Trump's wall: For Texans, it's complicated\n\nHearing that, Trump told the crowd:\n\n\"We're going to build the wall. We have no choice.\"\n\nAt the point, the crowd began chanting, \"build that wall.\" Trump joined in from the podium.\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol agents, endorsed Trump for President -- marking the first time the group had taken such an action. \n\nBrandon Judd, president of the council, said in a recent interview with CNN, that Trump was \"by far the best on border security\" when compared with other candidates.\n\nJudd said he didn't reach that decision based on his pledge to build a wall. He said his group favored \"barriers in strategic locations.\"\n\nBut, importantly, he didn't say those barriers had to come in the form of a wall as Trump is suggesting.\n\n'Doesn't have to be a wall'\n\n\"It doesn't have to be a wall,\" Judd said.\n\nHe called the double fencing along the border in the San Diego area \"insanely effective.\"\n\nJudd, who said he met with Trump and his transition team, argued such fencing allows agents to confront people on the US side of the border while they still have a fence in front of them to slow their progress.\n\n\"He was very much willing to listen to our perspective,\" Judd said. \"It was, you know: 'I didn't realize that'. And 'that's good to know'.\"\n\nTrump would then turn to an aide, Judd recounted, and say: \"Hey, get on this. Get back with me. I need to know more about this.\"\n\nJudd said he was confident his group's views were being taken into consideration.\n\n\"If you look at the areas they're currently surveying -- if you look at what the talk is, a lot of that is coming from us,\" he said. \"They absolutely 100% are in the process of implementing things we suggested.\"\n\nJudd said he signed a non-disclosure agreement that prohibited him from going into detail about planned construction.\n\nTrump believes millions voted illegally, WH says -- but provides no proof\n\nShawn Moran, vice president of the Border Patrol union, said he thinks most people would be surprised to learn that it's possible to drive for 30 minutes in some Border Patrol sectors and not encounter agents on patrol.\n\n\"I think a lot of Americans think you're going to see agents in towers every hundred yards,\" Moran said. \"That doesn't exist.\"\n\nHe said one instance in which a wall may have made a difference was in the 2009 slaying of Border Patrol Agent Robert Rosas. Rosas was shot to death by assailants who crawled under fencing near the eastern San Diego County town of Campo.\n\nThe US-Mexico border is approximately 2,000 miles long, running from San Diego to Brownsville, Texas. Trump initially said he wanted to wall off the entire border, but has since said that 1,000 miles may do.\n\nFew details\n\nHe has offered few details on the wall since being elected president. But speaking at a news conference earlier this month, he reiterated his pledge, referring to the border as \"an open sieve.\" He made construction sound imminent.\n\n\"Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin,\" he told reporters on Jan. 11.\n\nCNN reported earlier this month that Trump transition team officials had been in discussions with the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Interior Department to begin planning a wall, including how certain environmental laws could come into play.\n\n\"It seems clear they were trying to size up the environmental laws that may be obstacles to building the wall,\" said one U.S. official familiar with the inquiry.\n\nA review of Trump's statements on the campaign trail offers a glimpse of what he envisions -- or did at the time.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's thin skin\n\nTrump said his wall would be solid, strong and \"probably 35 to 40 feet up in the air.\"\n\n\"It will actually look good,\" he added. \"You know, as good as a wall is going to look.\"\n\nThe dimensions of the border barricade grew when former Mexican President Vicente Fox insisted his country would never pay for it.\n\n\"It just got 10 feet taller,\" Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer last year.\n\nWhen then-Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush referred to the proposed wall as a fence in August of 2015, Trump took to Twitter to correct him:\n\n\"It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL,\" Trump tweeted, \"and there's a BIG difference!\"\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC in February, then-candidate Trump said he'd priced out the project at about $8 billion. Later that month, he told Fox News' Sean Hannity the cost would be $10 billion.\n\n\"It's going to be a very terrific wall,\" Trump said. \"$10 billion is not bad.\"\n\nHannity asked Trump, whose name is synonymous with his brand as a builder and hotelier whether the name Trump will be on the wall.\n\n\"Only if its' beautiful,\" he replied.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.5471956133842469, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1351, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.3966439440499996, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.55440414507772, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/16/politics/donald-trump-times-bild-interview-takeaways/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1042, "scraper_regex": 1279}}, "headline": "Trump rattles NATO with 'obsolete' blast", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1279, "date": "20170116140000", "story_content": "Donald Trump's accusation that NATO is \"obsolete\" has led to \"astonishment and agitation\" within the alliance, Germany's foreign minister has said.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels before a meeting of EU foreign ministers, Frank-Walter Steinmeier suggested the alliance was rattled by the remarks by Trump.\n\nIn a joint interview with the Times of London and the German publication Bild, Trump signaled that US foreign policy in a range of areas could be turned on its head. He suggested that sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea could be eased in return for a deal to reduce nuclear weapons, that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had pursued \"catastrophic\" policies on refugees, and that his son-in-law Jared Kushner could lead a Middle East peace effort.\n\nSpeaking in Berlin, Merkel shrugged off the interview, saying she would make no substantive comment before Trump was inaugurated.\n\nNATO said it was \"absolutely confident\" that the US would remain \"committed\" to the organization \n\nNATO alliance 'obsolete'\n\nTrump used the interview to restate his doubts about NATO.  \"I said a long time ago that NATO had problems,\" he said in the interview.\n\n\"Number one it was obsolete, because it was designed many, many years ago. \n\n\"Number two the countries weren't paying what they're supposed to be paying,\" adding that this was unfair to the United States. \n\nSteinmeier said he had spoken with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, \"who is concerned that President-elect Trump regards NATO as obsolete.\"\n\nHe also noted Trump's position was \"in contradiction\" to that of James Mattis, Trump's nominee for defense secretary.\n\nRELATED: These NATO countries are not spending their fair share on defense\n\nNATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu pushed back against the comments. \"A strong NATO is good for the United States, just as it is for Europe.\"\n\nBut Dmitry Peskov, the press spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, agreed with Trump's assessment of NATO, saying on Monday that \"the systematic goal of this organization is confrontation.\"\n\nRussia and sanctions\n\nThe US and European Union both imposed sanctions on Russia after it seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 -- those sanctions were extended for a further six months in December 2016.\n\nTrump suggested they could be eased in return for a nuclear weapons deal. \n\n\"They have sanctions against Russia -- let's see if we can strike a few good deals with Russia. I think there should be less nuclear weapons and they have to be reduced significantly, that's part of it. \n\n\"But there are these sanctions and Russia is suffering lots from it. But I think there are things, which lots of people can profit from. \"\n\nREAD MORE: Trump suggests he would be open to lifting sanctions on Russia\n\nResponding to Trump's comments Monday, the Kremlin said that \"sanctions are not a question on our agenda, neither internally, nor in discussions with our international partners.\"\n\nJared Kushner: 'Middle East peacemaker'\n\nElsewhere in the interview Trump heaped praise on his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has been appointed as senior adviser to the president, reiterating he could play a peacemaker role. \n\n\"Do you know what? Jared is such a good guy; he will conclude an Israel agreement that no one else can do. You know, he is a natural talent, he is amazing, he is a natural talent,\" Trump said, according to Bild.\n\nAngela Merkel's 'catastrophic mistake'\n\nTrump set his sights on German Chancellor Angela Merkel, calling her \"by far the most important leader\" in Europe while tearing into her immigration policies, labeling them \"catastrophic.\"\n\n\"I have great respect for her, I felt she was a great leader, I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all these illegals and taking all these people where ever they come from and nobody really knows where they come from.\"  \n\nMerkel, who will run for a fourth term in elections this year, has stood firm on Germany's position of accepting nearly all asylum seekers found to be legitimate refugees. \n\nGermany took in more than one million refugees in 2015, making it the most open country in Europe to asylum seekers.\n\nSpeaking at a  joint press conference with New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English on Monday, Merkel said she would not comment before Trump's inauguration. \n\n\"We have known what his position is for some time, and my position is also known,\" she said. \n\nBrexit will be a 'great thing'\n\nAn enthusiastic Trump praised Britain's impending exit from the European Union as being \"so smart.\"\n\n\"I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing,\" Trump said to his interviewer from the Times, Michael Gove, one of the former leaders of the Brexit campaign, and a  sitting member of the UK Parliament.\n\nAsked why he thought the UK's Brexit campaign was successful, Trump blamed loose borders and concerns about the effects of immigration. He also tied it to US security concerns.\n\n\"Countries want their own identity. The UK wanted its own identity. I do believe this, if they hadn't been forced to take in all of the refugees so many, with all the problems that entails, you wouldn't have a Brexit... it probably could've worked out.\"\n\nAccording to the Times, Trump would offer Britain a \"fair\" trade deal with America within weeks of taking office. (In fact, Britain will not be able to begin negotiating new trade deals until the Brexit process is complete).\n\nHe also revealed that he was inviting Prime Minister Theresa May to visit him \"right after\" he gets into the White House.\n\n'Extreme vetting' of immigrants\n\nTrump said he will immediately take action to tighten US immigration restrictions once he's sworn in. \n\n\"This country we're going to go very strong borders. From the day I get in. One of the first orders I'm going to sign. Day one.\"\n\nTrump reiterated plans to implement what he calls \"extreme vetting\" of people from the Muslim world, according to a Bild transcript translated into English by CNN.\n\n\"There will be extreme security vetting, it won't be like it is now. We don't have any proper security controls for people entering our country, they don't really exist at the moment, like it has been the case in your country at least in the past.\"\n\nWhen asked if he would impose similar restrictions on Europe, the President-elect was noncommittal, according to Bild.\n\n\"That could happen. But we will see,\" he said.\n\nIran deal 'worst' ever made\n\nTrump also touched on the Iran nuclear agreement but declined to say whether he would demand changes to it. \n\n\"Well I don't want to say what I'm gonna do with the Iran deal. I just don't want to play the cards. I mean, look, I'm not a politician, I don't go out and say, \"I'm gonna do this\" \u2014 I'm gonna do, I gotta do what I gotta do . . . But I'm not happy with the Iran deal, I think it's one of the worst deals ever made,\" he said, according to the Times. \n\nTrump repeatedly slammed the deal on the campaign trail and in a 2015 op ed Trump said: \"When I am elected president, I will renegotiate with Iran.\" \n\nRepublican members of Congress have sharply criticized the deal since it was announced in 2014.\n\nTrump on Twitter\n\nTrump said he doesn't intend to lay off Twitter once he's in the Oval Office and will keep his @realDonaldTrump account, according to the Times of London.\n\n\"I thought I'd do less of it, but I'm covered so dishonestly by the press \u2014 so dishonestly \u2014 that I can put out Twitter \u2014 and it's not 140, it's now 280 \u2014 I can go bing bing bing . . . and they put it on and as soon as I tweet it out \u2014 this morning on television, Fox \u2014 'Donald Trump, we have breaking news.'\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.48471617698669, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1042, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.56163687338, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170116140000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.8790786948176605, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/01/politics/week-in-politics-trump-russia/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 763, "scraper_regex": 823}}, "headline": "Trump's Russia claims drive this week in politics", "wordcount_as_scraped": 823, "date": "20170101210000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump claims to have inside information on Russia's meddling in the United States' election -- and promises to reveal it \"Tuesday or Wednesday.\" \n\nAt a New Year's Eve party at his Mar-A-Lago estate, a tuxedoed Trump maintained that another culprit aside from Russia could have been behind the election intrusion.\"It could be somebody else.

John McCain, will hold a hearing on cyberthreats and the election-related hacking Thursday. \n\nThe issue could set the tone for relations between Trump and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate. \n\nNew Congress kicks off\n\nThe newly elected Congress will begin its work Tuesday at noon with a vote to officially re-elect Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as House speaker. \n\nSeveral new faces will appear in Congress, including Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and former Republican Florida governor and Senate candidate Charlie Crist, who is set to become a Democratic congressman. So will Florida's Brian Mast, a Republican and Army veteran who lost both of his legs in Afghanistan. \n\nAn old face, meanwhile, will appear in the Senate. Vice President Joe Biden will be back in the body where he spent more than three decades to swear in new senators, including California's Kamala Harris and Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto, who replaces retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. \n\nHill Republicans eye busy first 100 days of 2017\n\nThe Senate will quickly move toward confirmation battles over Trump's nominees -- with Democrats complaining that nominees aren't submitting materials they've requested, including their financial information and shouldn't get hearings and votes until those are provided. \n\nHouse Republicans, meanwhile, will condemn the Obama administration's handling of a United Nations vote on Israeli settlements on the West Bank. And House Democrats are opposing a GOP-backed rule change that would impose new fines for members who break rules of decorum. It's an effort to stop Democrats from using platforms such as Periscope and Meerkat to live-stream sit-ins on the House floor, as they did last year. \n\nObamacare strategy session\n\nPresident Barack Obama will make an unusual trip for a lame-duck president -- visiting Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning to meet with congressional Democrats and discuss how to fight Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to push the repeal of Obama's signature domestic achievement in the first week of the new Congress. \n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, face a defining moment in the early stages of the Trump era: If party members pledge not to help the GOP pass any replacement, it would place enormous pressure on Trump and congressional Republicans to come up with a way to keep 20 million Americans insured -- and get Congress to approve such a program. \n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will hold a conference call with House Democrats Monday on Obamacare. \n\nWhat else can Obama get done before leaving office? He's still working toward closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and could make additional pardons. His farewell speech will also be formally announced Monday. \n\nFilling out the Cabinet\n\nAfter a holiday getaway at his Mar-A-Lago estate, Trump has several cabinet positions left to fill. \n\nHe's expected to soon announce his choices for secretary of Veterans Affairs and Agriculture. \n\nOther key roles remain unfilled, as well -- including solicitor general, where top aide Kellyanne Conway's husband George Conway is reportedly a candidate, as well as Director of National Intelligence and deputy secretary of state. \n\nTrump to give deposition\n\nTrump will attempt to conclude a piece of older business this week with a deposition at Trump Tower this week. \n\nThe deposition comes as part of Trump's legal battle with the chef Jose Andres. \n\nAndres was supposed to launch a restaurant in the new Trump International Hotel in Washington. But after Trump's attacks on Mexicans as he began his presidential campaign in June 2015, Andres withdrew, and Trump sued him for breach of contract. \n\nCNN's Steve Brusk, Deirdre Walsh and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.07913672924042, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 763, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.4995867427, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170101210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.22804718217562, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/opinions/five-worrying-signals-from-trump-ghitis/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Five dark clouds hanging over Trump presidency", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1077, "date": "20161123020000", "story_content": "People everywhere have been wondering what kind of president Donald Trump will make. Will his shocking statements during the campaign turn out to have been political theater, or a sign of what's to come? \n\nWell, a couple of weeks into the transition, there's much to suggest that what we saw was no act, and that President Trump will implement policies that embody many of the most disturbing traits and statements displayed by candidate Trump.\n\nThe list is long, but here are five of the most troubling things we are already seeing:\n\nA welcome mat for extremism. Last week, America's reinvigorated neo-Nazis held a jubilant gathering to celebrate the rise of their beloved Trump. Snapping arms in the Nazi salute, some declared \"Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!\"\n\nBy victory, of course, they mean the incoming Trump presidency. The group's leader, Richard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, has reportedly called for \"peaceful ethnic cleansing,\" with a view to bringing America back to its white, European roots.\n\nSpencer and his ilk describe themselves as the \"alt-right,\" a deceptively anodyne term that masks an ugly white supremacism. Indeed, Spencer has quoted Nazi propaganda about Jews, the media, and others, and when he called on the crowd to use \"the original German,\" he wasn't talking about the language of Goethe. They shouted \"Lugenpresse,\" the Nazi term for critics in the media, meaning \"lying press.\"\n\nWe don't know how Trump feels about his most distasteful backers. In a meeting with The New York Times on Tuesday he made an attempt to distance his campaign from extremists. But there is no question the election awakened waves of bigotry around the country. Yes, his spokesman issued a statement saying Trump condemns racism. But why is it the President-elect can find the time to personally criticize \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"Hamilton\" via Twitter, yet struggles to squeeze in condemnation of some of the ugliest talk imaginable about minorities and women in America?\n\nA hotbed for conflicts of interest. Trump's failure to release his tax returns and the countless lawsuits against him cast a shadow over his campaign. But the Trump presidency risks bringing unprecedented levels of corruption to the US government.  \n\nIt is troubling enough to know that Trump is likely to allow his children to run the business rather than setting up a blind trust. But he is already including these same children in top-level meetings and calls with world leaders. In addition, he has taken time off from building a government to meet his partners from India, and suggested Tuesday that he may have lobbied Scotland against a wind farm near his golf course. And then there is Trump's hotel in Washington, which has reportedly hired a new \"director of diplomatic sales.\" Already, foreign dignitaries appear to see stays as a way of currying favor with the President-elect.\n\nThe conflicts of interest are rolling along like an unstoppable freight train headed for a collision with the Constitution's Emoluments Clause. \n\nBut the issue goes beyond any actual efforts by Trump to enrich himself. A sense of corruption at the highest levels would be disastrous for America. And the truth is that Trump apparently doesn't understand the problem. He tweeted that we all knew about his businesses around the world, and that only the \"crooked media\" minds. On Tuesday, he allegedly told The New York Times: \"The law's totally on my side, the president can't have a conflict of interest.\"\n\nFree press, free speech under attack. Attacking the media was a crowd pleaser at campaign rallies, and the undermining of professional journalists looks set to become a primary strategy under chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nTrump, clearly, has little respect for the First Amendment. When asked about his commitment to it on Tuesday by The New York Times, he claimed, \"I think you'll be happy.\" But the day before, in a most inappropriate use of his position, he was relentlessly attacking the media, including individual outlets, in what seemed to be an effort to intimidate potential critics and undercut their credibility. \n\nDonald Trump is about to become the world's most powerful man, yet he has busied himself attacking television comics, award-winning professional journalists and Broadway actors. If he didn't want to be criticized then he ran for the wrong job.  A man with such a low tolerance for criticism is a threat to everyone's freedom of speech.\n\nA hazy view of the world. It was easy to overlook candidate Trump's simplistic and contradictory foreign policy pronouncements. But now that he has been elected, the world is on edge, especially as Trump's objectives for America are astonishingly hazy. \n\nWith Trump seemingly prepared to throw in America's lot with Russia, it seems possible the biggest winners will be the most dangerous regimes. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said Trump may be a \"natural ally.\" The Syrian people, meanwhile, are being massacred by a Syrian regime propped up by Iran, Russia and the terrorist group Hezbollah. Trump, who says he wants to focus only on destroying ISIS, may end up throwing America's weight behind the axis of destruction in Syria. But if he helps Assad win, he will only have strengthened Iran, a country he claims he wants to get tougher with.\n\nMeantime, in Europe, America's allies are wondering how much he respects NATO, the alliance that has underpinned global security since World War II.\n\nTurning back the clock on the environment. Trump's pre-election statements on the environment could not have been more alarming. Trump has dismissed climate change as a Chinese invention aimed at hurting America. True, during his New York Times interview he allowed that there is \"some connectivity,\" between human activity and the climate. But the man overseeing the transition for the Environmental Protection Agency, Myron Ebell, heads an organization The New York Times notes is funded \"in part by the coal industry,\" reminiscent of the tobacco-funded think tanks that used to challenge the idea that cigarettes are harmful. Ebell, who like Trump vows to dismantle environmental protections, is a climate denier. But if temperatures rise, he wrote, fewer people will die from the cold, and people will rather enjoy the balmy weather.\n\nOf course, it is early yet.

The trendy young face of Austria's far-right", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1056, "date": "20161203000000", "story_content": "At the stroke of midnight in Vienna city center, members of Austria's so-called Identity Movement slipped on high-visibility vests and boarded a crane to pull off an audacious political prank: Draping a huge black cloth resembling a giant niqab -- the Islamic face veil -- onto a 90-meter-tall statue of the Habsburg ruler, Empress Maria Theresa.   \n\nIn case their political motivations were in any doubt, they also tacked up a sign that read \"Islamization. No thank you!\" and signed it with the symbol of the Identity Movement.  \n\nVienna police were less than amused to wake up to the sight of a national monument draped in such a provocative political protest -- but no one has been arrested for the stunt. \n\nMartin Sellner, however, was pleased: \"We try to teach patriots in Europe methods of non-violent action. That's our main principle. No violence. No real hate speech.\"    \n\nA clean-cut 27-year-old graphic designer, wearing black-framed glasses and brightly-colored shirts advertising Identity Movement slogans such as \"Europa Nostra\" -- \"Our Europe\" -- Sellner has been called the \"hipster\" of the far-right. \n\n\"We see ourselves as patriots, not neo-Nazis,\" he says. \"We don't hate immigrants. But we also don't want to see the country change and end up minorities in our countries. We wanted to express this opinion without anti-Semitism, without the racism of the old right.\"\n\nIt is a carefully cultivated image: a sunny veneer masking a political ideology centered on a white Christian identity which rejects immigration and globalization.\n\nREAD MORE: What does the alt-right do now?\n\nInflux of refugees\n\n\"My generation was never asked if we want this mass immigration, this Islamization and population replacement in this country,\" he explains over several cups of Viennese coffee. \"We were born into a society that believes we are racist for simply saying that we are becoming a minority in our own country.\" \n\nIn a series of posts on YouTube, Sellner suggests white Christians are on the verge of \"extinction,\" increasingly marginalized by growing numbers of migrants in what he calls the \"Great Replacement.\"\n\n\"My biggest fear is that at some point demographics could kill democracy,\" he says, \"that our society by mass immigration becomes such an ethnically fragmented society that a real democracy is not possible anymore because there is no common ground of values, history and identity.\"\n\nBut that fear isn't supported by the numbers. \n\nWhile an estimated 15% of Austria's population are foreign citizens, approximately half of those come from within the EU. For Sellner, intra-European migration -- white and Christian -- is acceptable. Non-European residents in Austria are outnumbered 10 to one. \n\nStill, Sellner is not alone: Worries about migration reached fever pitch last year when more than a million asylum seekers crossed into Europe, at least 700,000 of them via Austria. \n\nMany were from Syria and Afghanistan, and while most were simply passing through on their way to Germany, Sweden and elsewhere, an estimated 90,000 opted to stay and claim asylum in Austria. \n\nREAD MORE: Can Europe survive the Trump effect?\n\nSurge in far-right support\n\nThe Austrian government responded by erecting border fences, decreeing that only 3,200 migrants would be allowed to enter the country each day, and capping resettlement claims to 80 a day until an annual limit of 37,500 was reached. \n\nAcross Europe, the tide of new arrivals has prompted waves of anti-immigrant sentiment; far-right parties such as France's National Front and Austria's Freedom Party are seeing a surge in support.\n\nSellner is a big fan of US President-elect Donald Trump, whom he calls \"God Emperor.\" He hopes Trump's election victory -- on a platform that included plans to build a wall along the Mexican border and a ban on Muslim immigrants -- will further inspire the far-right across the continent. \n\nThe Identity Movement began in France, but has since spread to Austria, Denmark and Germany. It appeals to a younger generation seeking to distance itself from the openly racist, xenophobic far-right parties of the past. \n\nSellner insists that the movement is not racist but \"ethno-pluralist\" -- it doesn't believe that white Christian culture is superior, he says, but that globalization is forcing countries to adopt a multiculturalism that destroys the ethnic and cultural values of individual states. \n\n\"We are not fighting against diversity. We don't think that people need to be racially pure,\" he says, adding that the group rejects \"anti-Semitism or (anything) that identifies the problem with a certain people.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Holocaust survivor: Don't let far-right win\n\n'Crazy ideologies'\n\nYet the Identity Movement does single out one group: Muslims. Only an estimated 7% of Austrians are Muslim. But in Vienna and its suburbs -- where Sellner grew up -- Muslims make up more than 12% of the population, and some neighborhoods are majority Muslim. \n\nSellner claims this is \"Islamization\" and that the Muslim religion is incompatible with Austrian values -- but even he admits Islam has a long history in Vienna. \"After all,\" he says, gesturing to the mirrored salon of the Viennese cafe we are talking in. \"We are drinking coffee brought by the Turks!\" \n\nGiven Europe's history, its 20th-century slide into fascism, the great wars that killed millions and singled out Jews and other minorities for genocide, isn't Sellner worried that the Identity Movement may be one step on a slippery slope to repeating that dark past?  \n\nNo, he says: \"I feel a kind of fatherly responsibility for young Austrian patriots not to let them go into these extreme subcultures that are driven by hate and crazy ideologies.\"\n\nInstead he claims, perhaps counterintuitively, \"I think the entire movement is the strongest force against far-right extremism in Austria.\"\n\nIt's difficult to know just how many support the Identity Movement, but Sellner hopes far-right anti-immigrant candidate Norbert Hofer will be voted into power in Sunday's presidential election.  \n\nREAD MORE: Who is Austria's Norbert Hofer?\n\nAnd while that may not change Austrian policy immediately -- the Austrian president's role is largely ceremonial -- it would be proof of what Sellner believes is a \"silent majority\" in the country who share his beliefs.  \n\n\"The main idea of equality and opportunity is great. No one would object to that. But the problem is egalitarianism. People are different. We look different. We have different cultures, languages and traditions. Politics and policies need to reflect that,\" he says. \n\n\"I think every society has only a certain capacity for integration. I think we have gone far beyond that capacity in Europe.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.90534210205078, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 950, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.56808125306, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 7, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161203000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.05263157894737, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/02/opinions/why-we-burned-the-flag-for-freedom-jillette/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Penn Jillette: Why we burned the flag for freedom", "wordcount_as_scraped": 740, "date": "20161203010000", "story_content": "At the beginning of this century, Teller and I made a TV show in which we traveled around the world watching street magicians. These weren't conjurers who worked for tourists, but the magicians who performed for locals. We spent the nights in fairly nice hotels, but the days we spent on the streets in real Egypt, real China and real India.\n\nBefore this trip, we'd never considered ourselves overly patriotic; we never really thought about it. But we landed back in the USA feeling that John Wayne was a bit too hippie for our taste. Nothing can make you love the USA more than overseas travel.\n\nWhen we got back to doing our own magic show at our own theater in Las Vegas, we wanted to do a new magic trick that would express our newly-understood patriotism. We wanted to publicly salute the American flag and the republic for which it stands.\n\nOverseas, we saw poverty, disease and injustice, but what really struck us, what made us kiss the ground at McCarran airport in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States of America, was freedom. Freedom was what those other countries were so sorely lacking --  freedom that we must never take for granted.\n\nWe decided to do a magic trick that would celebrate the freedoms we could now taste so intensely. One of the standard plots in magic is a restoration. You rip, cut, tear or burn something and restore it into one piece.\n\nUsually a restoration means nothing but sleight of hand skill. You borrow a handkerchief, put in a rolled up piece of paper, burn it up, and then \"abracadabra\" it's back!  It's a miracle for no reason.\n\nBut what if instead of a handkerchief that meant nothing, we used a piece of cloth that was nothing but meaning?  What if we used the flag of the United States of America?  And what if instead of a meaningless piece of paper to wrap it in, we wrapped it in first 10 amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America, the Bill of Rights?\n\nWhat if, instead of \"abracadabra,\" we used a verse of \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" and what if the magic power the audience would cheer for was the freedom to burn the very flag that we loved so dearly? What if the magic of freedom restored the burnt flag?\n\nEvery night in our show we burned an American flag and then, with the celebration of freedom of speech, we made it reappear, whole, waving high on its flagpole. We did that trick thousands of times live for a couple million people, and every performance my eyes teared up just a little bit.\n\nMany veterans and other patriots told us after the show it was their favorite magic trick. We didn't kid ourselves; carny trash like Penn & Teller don't deserve that kind of reaction. These people were cheering freedom.\n\nWithout the right to burn the flag, without that freedom of expression, the flag is just a piece of cloth. It means nothing. With that freedom, with our Bill of Rights, it's the greatest symbol on earth. It's magic.\n\nFor the TV show \"The West Wing\" we performed our flag burning trick at the fictional first daughter's birthday party. Within the plot of the show, some people didn't understand our passionate magic trick. They didn't understand that it was a celebration of freedom, and they demanded to know whether we'd burned a flag in the White House.\n\nThe fictional president stuck up for us and explained that the Supreme Court and the Founding Fathers knew that for the flag to be revered, it must stand for real freedom.\n\nDo we really burn a flag in that trick? Do we symbolically burn the flag? Or do we vanish the flag in a patriotic flash of fireworks? It doesn't matter at all. The flag burning trick is a celebration of American freedom any way you look at it.\n\nMaybe some people don't understand what really makes this country great. Maybe they think it's a crime if Penn & Teller burned a flag on national TV.  Maybe some people will think that we should go to jail, or lose our citizenship, for a patriotic magic trick.\n\nI sure hope no one misunderstands our simple message because I promise you that although many other Americans love this country as much as I do -- no one loves it more.

When asked about it by German media, Mathies said, \"The term was used in a very unfortunate way. It is used within the police internally and also in the media. But again, it is very unfortunate it was used in the midst of this situation, I regret this very much and I cannot take it back.\"\n\nSome say the expression is free of any racial connotations, while others, including politicians from the left leaning SPD and the Greens, say it is highly dehumanizing.\n\nThe increased security operations also saw officers carrying out random ID checks throughout the night while two dozen police vehicles including armored personnel carriers, water cannons and concrete roadblocks were also in place to maintain peace throughout the festivities. \n\n\"Thanks to the good collaboration of all security partners, the City of Cologne, the Cologne Police and the Federal Police, our New Year's Eve in Cologne was cheerful and safe,\" said Gergor Timmer, spokesman for Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker, who cited the enhanced security measures behind the city's safe holiday period.  \n\n\"This turned out to be a success. The citizens of Cologne and our guests from all over the world reclaimed the places and streets around the cathedral.\"\u00a0\n\nRoughly half a million visitors attended the New Year's Eve celebrations in Cologne to watch a firework display, with an estimated 50,000 revelers around the Cologne Cathedral and another 10,000 partygoers in the old part of the city.\n\nLast year's attacks fueled a political firestorm over immigration in Germany after police described the perpetrators as gangs of Arab or North African men. Over the last 12 months anti-refugee sentiment has increased in the country.

Supporters of the independence movement claim the region has been marginalized from government participation and development.\n\nThe Igbo are one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa's most populous nation, and their historical grievances carry over after the Nigerian Civil War, which started in 1967 and was largely fought to repress the Igbo secessionist movement. The Igbo lost the war, which ended in 1970.\n\n \n\n \n\nFor more than a year the IPOB have been staging a series of rallies seeking the establishment of a Biafran state. \n\nProtests intensified in October 2015 when Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the IPOB, was arrested.

The GOP leadership, which controls the cameras in the chamber, recessed the House and shut down official coverage, but Democrats turned to livestreaming tools like Periscope and Facebook Live to broadcast dozens of members making speeches from the House floor. \n\nThe unprecedented use of social media from the sit-in gained national attention, but didn't result in any action on gun bills. Rank and file Republicans, irritated at the flagrant disregard for decorum rules, pressured leaders to punish the rule breakers, saying letting it go would only encourage more disruptions in the future.\n\nThe rules package for the 115th Congress doesn't penalize any of those Democrats who participated in the summer protest, but it includes a provision imposing a $500 fine for any House member who uses electronic photography or audio recording that broadcasts any proceedings from the House floor in the future. For any additional violation the fine would be increase to $2,500 per offense and the money would be taken out of a member's salary.\n\nRELATED: Rep. John Lewis goes back to his roots\n\nHouse Democrats continue to be unapologetic for their strategy that effectively allowed them to take over the House floor. They disregarded those presiding over the chamber who cut off the session and instead remained in an empty chamber filming their protest on social media, which news outlets used in reports, even after being warned repeatedly they were out of order. \n\nHouse Minority leader Nancy Pelosi taunted Republicans earlier this year as GOP leaders mulled over option for retaliation, saying, \"make my day.\"  \n\nTop Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan repeatedly denounced those involved in the sit-in, but struggled on how to respond.

Rex Tillerson, tipped to be the next secretary of state, is not a KGB agent. \n\nDonald Trump is, however, trying to reset US policy toward Russia to begin a constructive dialogue. For this, he ought to be applauded. Instead, he is almost accused of treachery. The situation is surreal.\n\nLet's analyze those two allegations separately. First, the CIA reportedly believes that Russia likes Trump, hacked the Democrats during the election, and leaked information via WikiLeaks to assist their preferred candidate. If the CIA's claims are true, and doubts exist, then this is very bad news and must be investigated. \n\nTrump is wrong to criticize the CIA without having all the facts at his disposal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is right to lend his support to a congressional hearing into Russian activities. Conservative David Frum, a senior editor at The Atlantic and the chairman of Policy Exchange, lays out five critical questions that the public needs answers to: who did they hack, when did it happen, was it coordinated, are there financial ties involved and are the Russians doing this elsewhere, too?\n\nBut let's keep the Trump hack story in perspective. Messing about in other people's elections is -- however awful -- not unheard of. Trump supporters are sharing a Los Angeles Times article from 1996 in which American political strategists boast about their role in helping re-elect President Yeltsin in the recent Russian presidential election, and foreign governments have had a hand in various aspects of the US electoral process for decades.  \n\nThe question that Frum omits from his list is \"did the Russians change the outcome of the 2016 election?\" The answer is almost certainty \"nyet.\" After all, WikiLeaks had a very small role in the campaign; the Trump people complained that its revelations were overshadowed by the infamous \"grabbing women\" tape. The FBI's investigation of Clinton's emails certainly had a much, much bigger impact than anything done by the KGB. Who were they working for? The North Koreans?\n\nIf I sound cynical then it's because I am. The core of senators demanding an investigation of Russian involvement -- Chuck Schumer, Jack Reed, John McCain and Lindsey Graham -- are two Democrats who have votes to win on this issue and two Republicans who are prominent neoconservatives. \n\nMcCain and Graham opposed Trump throughout the primaries in part because he threatens the hawkish consensus that has dominated Washington for a very long time. A consensus that sees Russia as a perpetual and imminent threat to Western security.\n\nTrump's people see things differently. Peter Beinart of The Atlantic suggests they are informed by a view of history at odds with the Russophobic neocons. For Trumpites, the Cold War was a struggle with an atheist, socialist superpower that had to be won. Once it was over and Russia reverted to its Christian roots, Moscow evolved from an enemy to a cultural ally in the far more relevant conflict with radical Islam. Many Trumpites, it is true, see Vladimir Putin as a champion for traditionalist values. They ask why America pretends to loathe him when he's fighting on the same side in Syria.\n\nThe answer, of course, is that he's not. Putin is fighting with President Bashar al-Assad -- not for democracy but to sustain a bloodthirsty dictator who serves Moscow's strategic interests. Russophiles are just as myopically enthusiastic about Putin as the neoconservatives sometimes seem suicidally hell-bent on war. Between these two positions is a rational third way. There's evidence that Trump inhabits it.\n\nTake Rex Tillerson, the subject of the second allegation I noted at the beginning of this article -- that Trump is thinking about appointing a Moscow patsy as secretary of state. This is nonsense. Yes, Tillerson knows Putin and has done business with him. Are these not strong qualifications for dealing with Russia? He has received Russia's Order of Friendship, true. But so have a former archbishop of Canterbury and the former Prime Minister of Canada. If those two are KGB assets then the world really is in trouble.\n\nFinally, Tillerson has opposed sanctions on Russia. But that makes sense given that he is the CEO of ExxonMobil, which was hurt by sanctions imposed after the partitioning of Ukraine. He is a statesman of business -- that's what stands out about his appointment. Trump is compiling a Cabinet of mini-Trumps, of largely aging, white, male business leaders who see the world in terms of the bottom line rather than grand theories of international relations. \n\nThey are not, I suspect, motivated by Slavophilia or a passion for Russian orthodoxy. Rather, they see Putin for what he really is: a strong man in a weak position. Russia's economy and army are antiquated and not particularly strong -- and the country is surrounded by a ring of NATO countries committed to mutual defense.\n\nAll Putin really has to his advantage is a lot of hackers and an arsenal of nuclear weapons. The latter is why we still have to be very, very careful when dealing with him.\n\nWhy not talk to Putin? Why not acknowledge that America cannot run the world and that other nations have legitimate strategic interests? What's fascinating about Trump is that while he might regard America as an exceptional country, he's honest about its failings and refuses to pretend it has a right to global domination. \n\nHe is assembling a team that does contain some hawks, such as, potentially, John Bolton, and that has tough talk for countries like Iran. But it's also a team of realists. \n\nSomewhere between Obama's retreat from the Middle East and George W. Bush's invasion of it is an approach based on cautious national self-interest. I sincerely hope Trump adopts it.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.8459274768829306, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 948, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.18560277821, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.74261603375527, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/health/shyamalan-split-movie-dissociative-identity-disorder/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1309, "scraper_regex": 1420}}, "headline": "What Shyamalan's 'Split' gets wrong about dissociative identity disorder", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1420, "date": "20170123210000", "story_content": "Psychiatrist Dr. Garrett Marie Deckel received a \"moving\" email last week from a patient with multiple personalities, a condition known as dissociative identity disorder, or DID.\n\n\"There's a new movie out about a person with DID. It's a thriller/horror movie,\" her patient wrote, referring to M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie. \"Do I ever scare you?\"\n\nIn Shyamalan's latest film, \"Split,\" actor James McAvoy plays the villain, a man with 24 personalities who abducts and torments three girls in a windowless bunker. The film opened at No. 1 this weekend with more than $40 million in domestic sales. Though McAvoy, best known for his work in the \"X-Men\" prequels, has received praise from critics for his performance in \"Split,\" the Hollywood film has faced criticism for how it portrays mental illness. \n\nMental health advocates warn that the film stigmatizes dissociative identity disorder and may directly impact those living with it.\n\n\"You are going to upset and potentially exacerbate symptoms in thousands of people who are already suffering,\" said Deckel, a DID specialist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, immediately after seeing the film.\n\nA coping mechanism\n\nAmelia Joubert, 18, of Fort Mill, South Carolina, was diagnosed with DID three years ago. She lives with 11 other personalities, or alters. Even before she was diagnosed, the way she spoke would change throughout the day: sometimes with a Southern accent, sometimes like a small child. \n\nLike most patients with DID, Joubert suffered ongoing trauma as a young child.\n\nAccording to Deckel, people who have been chronically abused, typically in situations with no viable escape, may \"reconfigure the mind\" into different parts or personalities. Some of these parts can step in to handle traumatic or stressful situations, while other parts dissociate, or escape, from reality.\n\nFor an introverted Joubert, this may mean calling on her energetic alter, Scarlet, in large crowds. \n\nSince beginning therapy, she has been able to better control and agree on the switches with her alters. For Joubert and many others with DID, the goal of therapy is not always to \"integrate\" the different parts back into one, but to learn to function and work together.\n\n\"She has been able to use them very effectively,\" said her therapist, clinical psychologist Bilal Ghandour. \"There's no reason to disrupt that system, as she calls it.\"\n\n\"It really is a survival or a coping mechanism,\" said Joubert, who does not plan to see \"Split.\"\n\nIn contrast with McAvoy's character, Deckel said, people with DID, who may represent over 1% of Americans, are rarely violent. Research has shown that they are far more likely to hurt themselves than to hurt others. \n\nBut movies tend to portray only \"the most extreme aspects\" of the disorder, she said. This can misrepresent a form of mental illness that is not well understood by the lay public, and even some psychiatrists, she said.\n\n\"In my residency, I don't even think DID was brought up,\" said Deckel, who believes that a lack of training and research is one reason why even some mental health professionals approach the disorder with skepticism.\n\nJoubert, who has been hospitalized in residential and acute care facilities, said she often felt that her doctors did not understand or even believe in her disorder. \n\n\"I was tired of hearing this and feeling like I had to be ashamed of something ... that helped me survive trauma as a child,\" she said.\n\nA community reacts\n\nJoubert maintains a YouTube channel and manages a DID support group on Facebook with nearly 4,000 members. Many are people living with DID, but some are family members and clinicians.\n\n\"People are upset\" about the film, she said. \"They're feeling discriminated against ... but this is nothing new.\"\n\nLike the patient who emailed Deckel, Joubert said people have asked whether she was dangerous. She works as a nanny and said one online commenter suggested that she should not be working with children.\n\nJoubert said she thinks \"Split\" is having a larger impact for younger people with DID; they're less familiar with older films, such as \"Psycho\" and \"Identity,\" that also contain violent characters with multiple personalities. She is afraid that \"Split\" may deter young people from coming out and seeking help.\n\n\"This is the first big movie they've experienced that has a stigma to it,\" she said. \"It's hitting hard for that reason.\"\n\nThere are some more positive portrayals in the media, she said, such as \"United States of Tara.\" In the Showtime dramedy about a suburban American family, Toni Collette played a mother who is diagnosed with DID. The series, which Joubert said was \"overexaggerated, but had a lot of relatable things,\" ran from 2009 to 2011.\n\n\"At this point, any movie that doesn't villainize us is a win,\" she said.\n\nLeah Peterson, 46, of San Diego, California, has written about her experience with DID and was brought on as a consultant on all three seasons of \"United States of Tara.\"\n\nWhen the trailer for \"Split\" came on in a movie theater, Peterson \"had to get up and leave.\"\n\n\"It's not about the acting or the people who wrote it,\" she said. \"But are you doing a disservice to the people you're portraying?\"\n\nScottish actor McAvoy, whose representatives did not respond for comment, has said he was unable to speak to someone with DID in preparation for the role. Instead, he told \"Today Show\" host Matt Lauer that he \"spent a bit of time with some medical professionals\" and watched YouTube diaries made by people with DID.\n\n\"I couldn't find anybody that would sit and talk with me, unfortunately,\" McAvoy said.\n\nHoping to shape the conversation\n\nClinical psychologist Bethany Brand, a professor at Towson University, was contacted in late 2014 by Shyamalan, who was hoping to learn more about DID. They met twice in early 2015, once at his home in Pennsylvania. \n\n\"I understood it was a big gamble,\" Brand said, adding that she was not paid to speak with Shyamalan. \"I hoped that I would be able to influence the movie.\"\n\nBrand said she offered to help introduce people with DID to Shyamalan, who did not respond to CNN's request for comment. She did not speak with McAvoy or Joaquin Phoenix, the film's original lead.\n\nShortly after the trailer was released in July, Brand emailed the filmmaker to express concern.\n\n\"The trailer for Split is causing outrage among trauma and general therapists,\" she wrote in emails she shared with CNN. \"Do you plan to do anything to help the patients you are portraying as dangerous?\"\n\nShyamalan responded that he and Universal Pictures were interested in promoting information and support for those with DID.\n\n\"When the film opens we will work ... together and raise awareness,\" he wrote.\n\nBrand was also put in touch with a representative from Universal Pictures. She described their conversation as encouraging.\n\n\"And then, crickets,\" said Brand. \"There was nothing.\"\n\nShyamalan told Yahoo Movies for a story published last week that he has seen no backlash over the film's treatment of mental health issues among people who have seen the final product.\n\n\"We've had no issues from people that have seen the finished film, just zero,\" he said.\n\nThe International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, a leading professional organization in dissociative disorders, of which Brand is a member, released a statement (PDF) today calling on Shyamalan and Universal Pictures to support DID research and education.\n\nJoubert sent her own petition to Shymalan's production company, Blinding Edge Pictures, in September. With more than 16,000 signatures, it called on the actors to publicly affirm that violence is rare among those with DID in the form of a PSA. A similar petition calling for a boycott of the film was signed by more than 20,000.\n\nJoubert did not receive a response to her petition.\n\n\"I feel like the DID community is being ignored,\" she said.\n\nJoubert said that she is not against people seeing the film but that she hopes for more education about the realities and misconceptions of DID. \n\nThe movie portrays the negative side of something in which many have found positives, according to experts and people living with DID.\n\n\"The brain is amazing that it's able to do this,\" said Peterson, a mother of four.\n\nThough Peterson no longer has alters, she credits them with getting her through traumatic periods in her life and said she understands the role they play for many people with DID.\n\n\"They are some of the strongest, most big-hearted people you will ever meet,\" she said. \"And you know some of them.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.7630662918090803, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1309, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.5698461665599996, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123210000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.90985485103132, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/26/americas/trump-latin-america/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00f1": [1072], "\u00e9": [5127, 9783, 9828]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1631, "scraper_regex": 1791}}, "headline": "Trump's wall isn't Latin America's only problem", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1791, "date": "20170127010000", "story_content": "US President Donald Trump kicked off his presidency announcing an \"America First\" hard-line approach of governing. And after several executive orders signed within his first week, he seems to be on track to see it through. But growing tensions between the United States and Mexico are not all that await President Trump when it comes to Latin America.\n\nAs leader of the free world, he also faces a deepening recession in Brazil, an economic disaster in Venezuela, a desperate migrant crisis in Central America and potential return to frosty relationship with Cuba. Here's a preview of the headaches that await:\n\nA 20% import tax to fund a border wall could be the end of NAFTA \n\n\"When the US sneezes, Mexico catches a cold.\" \n\nIt's a well-known catchphrase that sums up the close ties the neighboring countries share.\n\nNow, Mexico is trying to stave off pneumonia as tensions between the United States and Mexico are on high alert within the first week of Donald Trump's presidency. \n\nOn Thursday, Mexico President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto canceled his meeting with Trump after the US President announced sweeping measures to begin construction on a border wall that Mexico has repeatedly expressed no interest in having or paying for. The White House later announced Trump wants to impose a 20% import tax on goods from Mexico to pay for the wall, effectively ending the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\n\"Mexico doesn't believe in walls. Our country believes in bridges,\" President Nieto said before canceling his meeting. \"Our border should be our best space for living together -- a space of shared safety, prosperity and development.\" \n\nOn top of plans to build a wall and deport undocumented immigrants, President Trump is also threatening companies in Mexico with a 35% \"border tax.\"\n\nTrade experts say a Trump tariff on Mexico would cost jobs on both sides of the border. But it would be especially painful for Mexico, which sends over 70% of its products to the United States. Trump's threats are already a major reason why Mexico's currency, the peso, is near an all-time low. \n\nTrump hasn't said exactly what he wants in a new trade deal with Mexico, just that it better benefit US workers. He blames NAFTA for an exodus of US manufacturing jobs to Mexico. Congressional research found that NAFTA didn't cause massive job loss. Still, Trump plans to get tough on Mexico. \n\nMexico doesn't plan to take any threats lying down. Its economy minister said the government would respond immediately to any trade actions Trump imposes on Mexico. \n\nThe economic collapse of Venezuela \n\nVenezuelans suffer from chronic food and medical shortages, leaving many to starve and some to die in hospitals lacking basic supplies. \n\nAt the core of Venezuela's problems is an economic crisis caused by massive government overspending, mismanaged resources, low oil prices and government corruption. The International Monetary Fund projects Venezuela's economy will shrink 6% this year and inflation will soar 1,660%. \n\n\"Venezuela has not only become an economic problem, but a humanitarian concern,\" Alejandro Werner, the  International Monetary Fund's director of the Western Hemisphere, said Monday at the Council of the Americas.  \n\n\"Walking back all the destruction that's happened will take several years,\" Werner said.\n\nOn top of its domestic crises, Venezuela has increasingly relied on China and Russia for aid in exchange for cash and weapons, adding to its geopolitical importance. The once wealthy nation has the most oil reserves in the world. \n\nTrump criticized Venezuela's socialist president, Nicolas Maduro, on the campaign trail for oppressing Venezuelans. And his administration could be getting tougher on Maduro. Trump's secretary of state nominee, Rex Tillerson, butted heads with Maduro in a feud over oil when Tillerson was CEO of ExxonMobil. Tillerson could bring that same strong-arm approach to Venezuela as America's top diplomat. \n\nDespite bad blood with Tillerson, Maduro has hesitated to criticize Trump so far.  \n\n\"He won't be worse than Obama,\" Maduro said at a news conference on January 17. \"Let's wait and see.\" \n\nWhere does that leave US-Cuba relations?\n\nSince the election, Cubans have wondered what the Trump presidency will mean for the communist-run island and whether former President Barack Obama's landmark opening with Cuba will survive.\n\nDuring his second term, Obama re-established diplomatic relations with Cuba after more than 50 years, made history by becoming the first US president to visit the island since the 1959 revolution and ended the so-called \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy that allowed Cubans who reached the United States to stay there.\n\nMany Cubans are hopeful that Trump will restore their special immigration status, but so far he has not given any indications that migrants from Cuba would be exempt from his stringent anti-immigration policies. \n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump shifted from saying he agreed with the Cuba opening, even if he would have negotiated \"a better deal,\" to then promising to scrap the new d\u00e9tente with Havana if Cuba's leaders did not allow greater political and religious freedoms.\n\nAfter Fidel Castro's death in 2016, Trump in a statement signaled he would take a harder line on Cuba.\n\n\"Fidel Castro's legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights,\" the statement said, referring to Castro as \"a brutal dictator.\"\n\nSo far Cuban officials have taken pains to avoid criticizing Trump and are waiting to see what the new President will do before returning to the adversarial relationship of the Cold War.\n\nBut Trump's choice of Rex Tillerson for secretary of state seemed to indicate that dealings with Cuba will be much chillier in the new administration.\n\n\"Our recent engagements with the government of Cuba wasn't accompanied by any significant concessions on human rights,\" Tillerson said during his confirmation hearings. \"We have not held them accountable for their conduct. Their leaders receive much while their people receive little. That serves neither the interest of Cubans or Americans.\"\n\nThe migration crisis you might have missed could get worse \n\nTens of thousands of migrants trek across South and Central America every year and those dreams aren't likely to end with the Trump presidency. They take buses, trains and boats -- braving huge swaths of uninhabited swampland, criminal gangs and hunger -- in the hopes of making their way to the United States, where they dream of a good job and a better life. \n\nAfter Trump's election, there was a surge in migrants fleeing violence in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, trying to make it across the border before tougher controls are imposed by the new administration.\n\nWith Trump vowing to begin building a wall along the US-Mexican border, the bottlenecks at border crossings across the Americas are expected to get worse.\n\nThe stakes are even higher when it comes to Cuban and Haitian migrants. When thousands of Cubans abandoned their homes, they expected to take advantage of decades-old special immigration privileges extended to those who made it to US borders, the so-called wet-foot, dry-foot rule.\n\nBut their lives were upended when Obama eliminated the policy on January 12, just days before the end of his second term. Cuban migrants accumulating along American borders are pleading with President Trump to take them in as political refugees, as part of his pledge to take a hard-line stance against Cuba's Communist government.\n\nFor the tens of thousands of Haitian migrants who fled poverty and hunger in the wake of the 2010 earthquake, the outlook is bleak. Many took advantage of humanitarian visas extended by Brazil at a time when its economy was booming. \n\nBut with a deep recession that has dragged on for two years, many Haitian migrants began to look north to the United States, which had started allowing Haitians in after the earthquake. That moratorium on deportations was lifted in September. But not before some 40,000 Haitians, according to the US Secretary of Homeland Security, began the monthslong journey toward the United States.\n\nNow, thousands of desperate Haitians are also camping out along the southern borders. Thousands more are getting stuck at border crossings throughout Central America, sparking fears of a big spike in human trafficking.\n\nIn Brazil, populism is out. Corruption is still in\n\nIn Brazil, a massive corruption scandal implicating politicians in all the leading parties, as well as a two-year economic recession, has Brazilians calling for their own version of Trump.\n\n\"There is a lot of discontent in Brazil,\" said Joao Augusto de Castro Neves, Latin America director for the Eurasia Group consultancy. \"The common denominator is anti-establishment sentiment. The political class is not delivering.\" \n\nJoao Doria, also a former host of Brazil's edition of the reality TV show \"The Apprentice,\" was elected mayor of Brazil's biggest city, Sao Paulo, in a landslide. A political outsider, Doria built his own successful business and promotes conservative social values. But he hasn't exactly warmed to the nickname \"The Brazilian Trump,\" telling local media he would have voted for Hillary Clinton if he'd lived in the United States. \n\nThen there's Jair Bolsonaro, an outspoken congressman who has defended the military dictatorship, which ended in the 1980s. He is doing well in polls for the 2018 presidential election despite often outlandish outbursts on Twitter and on the congressional floor. Bolsonaro is an avid admirer of Trump, tweeting his congratulations on Inauguration Day.\n\nCongratulations, new President of United States of America - Parab\u00e9ns, novo Presidente dos Estados Unidos da Am\u00e9rica! @realDonaldTrump\u2014 Jair Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) January 20, 2017\n\nBut there are many things about Trump that don't go down well with Brazilian voters these days: Populism and protectionism are out of vogue. Many see free trade and market-friendly policies as the solution to soaring unemployment and inflation.\n\nIt's still too early to say if the Trump presidency will help or hurt the ailing Brazilian economy. \n\nOn the one hand, all emerging markets could take a beating if the world's biggest economy puts up barriers to trade as part of Trump's declared focus on \"buy American, hire American.\" But unlike Mexico, Brazil doesn't have a major trade agreement with the United States, so it has much less to lose.\n\nIn fact, analysts say Brazil, along with China, could benefit from Trump's decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and question NAFTA. As Latin America's biggest economy, there is room for Brazo; to negotiate bilateral deals.\n\n\"This could be an opportunity to redraw its strategic neighborhood,\" said Eurasia's Castro Neves.\n\nIn the end, the biggest challenge for Brazilian President Michel Temer might not be the new administration to the north, but the ongoing bribery and corruption investigation at home. Top politicians have been found guilty of taking bribes from construction companies and others in exchange for helping line up lucrative contracts with the state-run oil company Petrobras and passing beneficial legislation in Congress.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.81593704223633, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1631, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.2814224870199995, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 42, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170127010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.5751072961373396, "mft_mean": 3.8181818181800002}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/23/europe/berlin-christmas-market-attack-suspect-killed-milan": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 575, "scraper_regex": 968}}, "headline": "Berlin attack suspect Anis Amri killed in Milan shootout", "wordcount_as_scraped": 968, "date": "20161223140000", "story_content": "Video has emerged of Berlin Christmas market attack suspect Anis Amri pledging allegiance to ISIS. The footage appeared hours after the Tunisian man was killed in a Friday morning shootout with police in Milan, Italy. \n\nThe subject of a Europe-wide manhunt since Monday's deadly market attack, Amri was stopped in Sesto San Giovanni, a district in the northeastern part of Milan, just after 3 a.m. local time, Italian police said on Twitter.\n\nA video released on ISIS-affiliated website Amaq shows Amri pledging allegiance to the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and vowing that \"we will slaughter\" the \"crusaders who are shelling the Muslims every day.\"\n\nHe does not refer to Monday's attack that left 12 dead and injured 48, and it's not clear when or where the video was recorded. \n\nWho was Anis Amri?\n\nThe encounter that led to Amri's death began when Italian police asked for his papers. When that happened, Amri pulled a .22-caliber gun out of his backpack and fired at them, police said. \n\nThe driver of the police car returned fire, killing the 24-year-old suspect. A police officer, Cristian Morio, was shot in the encounter and is recovering in the hospital. A second officer, Luca Scata, was unharmed.  \n\nTwo countries tried to deport him\n\nAmri shouted, \"Bastard cops,\" before he was killed, according to Milan police Chief Antonio De Iesu.\n\nAt a press conference, Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti said the slain man was Amri \"without any doubt.\" The Tunisian had previously lived in Italy. \n\nThe officers were not searching for him but stopped Amri as part of normal patrol operations, De Iesu said.\n\nNobody had alerted the police to Amri's presence in the city.\n\nAmri traveled from France, report says \n\nItalian news agency ANSA said Amri came to Milan by train from the French region of Savoy.\n\nA spokeswoman for the French anti-terrorism prosecutor's office, Agnes Thibault Lecuivre, could not confirm the report, telling CNN the investigation was ongoing.\n\nMilan police said Amri arrived at the city's central station about 1 a.m. Friday.\n\nIf he did travel from France, Amri would have passed through at least two European borders after fleeing Berlin. \n\nIn response, Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Front Party, criticized the European Union's open borders policy as a \"security disaster.\"  \n\nGerman officials are working to determine whether Amri had a network of people helping him flee to Italy, German federal prosecutor Peter Frank said.\n\nAmri was on threat list \n\nAmri was considered to be one of the most dangerous Islamists in the country for months before Monday's attack, according to German intelligence officials.\n\nIn March, he was put on a German security services list of dangerous people, which currently includes 549 individuals, the officials said. \n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a press conference that government ministers will be assessing what security measures need to be adapted in the wake of this week's attack.\n\nMerkel said she had spoken to Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi about speeding up the process of returning Tunisians living in Germany illegally. \n\nLinks to Italy\n\nWithout identification, Amri entered Italy in February 2011 and claimed to be a 17-year-old minor, a spokesman for the Italian state police, Mario Viola, told CNN earlier this week.  \n\nWhile in Italy, he served four years in prison after being involved in an arson attack on a school, his father told Tunisian radio. \n\nViola said that Amri's jail term for damaging state property, assault and arson at the Lampedusa refugee center began in late 2011. He was released in May 2015.\n\nItalian authorities ordered his deportation, but Tunisian authorities wouldn't accept the request on the grounds of a lack of proper documentation, Viola said.\n\nAt that point, Italian authorities told Amri to leave the country, and officials lost track of him.\n\nAmri was \"not suspected\" of terrorism at the time and was considered a \"petty criminal,\" Viola said. The Tunisian came to Italy at the same time as thousands of others amid the turmoil of the Arab Spring, he said.\n\nHe left for Germany more than a year ago. \n\nHow the manhunt unfolded\n\nAmri's fingerprints were found in the cabin of the truck used in Monday's attack, and German authorities are investigating whether the gun Amri used Friday was the same one in the shooting death of the truck's Polish driver. \n\nThe slain driver may have been involved in a struggle with Amri before being shot. \n\nGerman authorities initially detained a Pakistani asylum seeker in connection with the Christmas market attack, but he was later released and a search began for Amri. \n\nEuropean authorities offered a reward of up to 100,000 euros (about $104,000) for information on his whereabouts.\n\nAccording to German investigative files obtained by CNN, Amri had ties to an ISIS recruitment network in Germany and had previously discussed launching an attack there.\n\nAmri's mother: 'I want the truth\n\nAmri's mother, Nour Elhouda Hassani, said her son called last Friday to catch up. Nothing had struck her as odd. \n\n\"All we talked about was how are you and how is everything. I did not notice anything strange about him,\" she said, speaking to CNN exclusively from her family's home in the small Tunisian town of Oueslatia. \"When he calls me, he was playful and always laughing.  He was not an extremist, he was like all young men around here. He always went out and drank alcohol.\"\n\nShe demanded answers about his death. \n\n\"I want the truth about what happened to my son,\" she said. \"I want the Tunisian and German government to tell me what happened to my son. We want the truth. Why did they kill him? He was a suspect; they could have gotten more information from him, had they captured him alive. Was he a terrorist?

Meanwhile, rising powers such as China, Russia and Iran are closely watching the developments to determine whether the convulsions in the West give them an opening to advance their own interests.\n\nOf course, the 15 years since the September 11 attacks have been dominated by war, strife and economic disruption. But what makes 2017 so unique is that America -- long a force for stability -- is poised to inaugurate one of the most impulsive presidents ever to walk into the Oval Office. \n\nFar from acting as a brake against turmoil sweeping the globe, America under Trump could exacerbate it. Nicholas Dungan, an Atlantic Council senior fellow, said uncertainty about the President-elect could widen divides in the transatlantic alliance, the bedrock of 70 years of Western stability.\n\n\"Donald Trump is in many respects the anti-Barack Obama,\" said Dungan, who teaches at Sciences Po, an international research university in France. \"With Obama, there was tremendous trust but very little performance. With Trump it looks like there will be a deficit of trust and a surfeit of action.\" \n\nWorld on edge\n\nIt's no wonder that Trump has the world on edge, despite arguments among supporters that the unpredictable statesmanship he has previewed in the presidential transition could strengthen the US position around the globe by keeping rivals off balance.\n\nHe has questioned US alliances that kept the peace for decades in Europe and Asia and suggested he will \"expand\" the US nuclear arsenal. He has spent his transition feuding with spy agencies that concluded Russia interfered in the election. And he signaled to China that the taboo topic of Taiwan is on the table, casting doubt on 40 years of diplomatic protocol.\n\nThe Trump effect could be all the more pronounced because the political equilibrium of much of the world has been upset, straining institutions and assumptions in international relations that have endured for decades. To judge how much has changed, and why the prospects of 2017 look so uncertain, it's worth looking back a year.\n\nWhen 2016 dawned, Obama, fresh from an Iran nuclear deal and seeing Obamacare upheld by the Supreme Court had every reason to expect a Democratic successor would secure his legacy. Republicans were confidently waiting for an establishment champion to emerge from their primary to send Trump back to reality TV.\n\nIn Britain, David Cameron was basking in a surprising parliamentary majority won in a 2015 election. Most end-of-year polls predicted the Remain camp would win a referendum on membership in the European Union.\n\nIn Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel, Time Magazine's reigning Person of the Year, was lauded for her moral example in embracing desperate refugees from the Middle East and was Europe's undisputed leader.\n\nAnd in Italy, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was readying a trip to the US to receive Obama's blessing after harnessing hope and change as a successful political message of his own.\n\nUnthinkable happened again and again and again\n\nBut within months, the unthinkable happened -- again, and again, and again.\n\nIn a blink of an eye, Cameron was gone, felled by a referendum in which voters who felt economically and culturally dispossessed opted to leave the EU.\n\nTrump won the US election after a vitriolic campaign that tore at social, cultural and political divides and left the rest of the world confused about American power and identity.\n\nRenzi is history, crushed Cameron-style by his own referendum defeat which dealt a second hammer blow to the EU.\n\nAnd Merkel, rocked by a year-end terror attack in Berlin, faces a fight for political survival in a fall election hinging on immigration politics and a right wing resurgence spurred by her open door refugee policy.\n\nIn France, where Islamic terrorism has become more frequent, President Francois Hollande acknowledged his dismal approval rating and nixed a re-election bid. The best hedge against an earthquake election win in May by far right national front leader Marine Le Pen is France's two-round election system that could unite opposition against her.\n\nA March election in the Netherlands promises a strong showing by far right leader Geert Wilders built on skepticism towards Brussels that is threatening the existence of the EU.\n\nStill if Merkel or an establishment rival prevails in Germany, and the hot favorite in the polls to win the French presidency, Francois Fillon, is also victorious, 2017 could be remembered as the year the populist revolt began to ebb.\n\nAdversaries mobilize\n\nAs the West reels, its adversaries are mobilizing.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin defied Obama's predictions his venture in Syria would end in a quagmire. Now, he seems on the way to restoring the lost Russian influence that he watched ebb in despair after the fall of the Soviet Union. \n\nIn Asia, Chinese President Xi Jinping is accelerating that country's accumulation of regional power and challenging US influence and allies in the South China Sea. A volatile President in the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, is trashing a prized US alliance.\n\nTrump's rejection of a vast Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact has already empowered China and undermined eight years of Obama's Asia pivot. \n\nThe instability and uncertainty makes the choices Trump makes once he is inaugurated in January especially crucial.\n\nShould the new administration follow through on the President-elect's tough rhetoric on China and take protectionist steps that could incite a trade war, tensions in Asia could spike considerably.\n\nIf Trump walks out on the Iran nuclear deal or infringes the Paris climate pact, he could send transatlantic relations into a spiral. Aligning the US closer to Moscow could also alarm European allies unless he makes a full-throated defense of NATO on his first trip to the continent.\n\nAsian allies Japan and South Korea are nervously trying to work out what Trump's campaign trail rhetoric means for crucial national security infrastructure in Asia. North Korea, meanwhile, is brewing what could be Trump's first big foreign crisis with its race for a functioning nuclear arsenal. \n\nIn the Middle East, Trump's vow to move the US embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv could light a match to Palestinian-Israeli antagonism and put US Arab allies in a tough spot.\n\nCould Trump's strategy work?\n\nOf course, there's no certainty that Trump will plunge the world into a new spiral of instability. Major policy shifts can be disorienting, but they aren't always negative.\n\nEvery President's foreign policy is in some ways a correction to that of his predecessor. So Trump's spontaneity could perhaps be an antidote to Obama's caution, which some critics said frittered away US power.\n\nQuestioning trade deals, alliances and conventions could actually end up strengthening the US at home and in the world, Trump supporters argue. And just because the One China policy has dictated relations between Washington and Beijing for decades does not mean it should always be so, they say. Trump's naval buildup, meanwhile, could reassure US allies who feel bullied by China.\n\nAnd in an era of strongman leaders like Xi, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a harder-to-read US President might keep American rivals off balance.\n\nForeign policy often begins at home. And if tax cuts and slashing regulation ignites explosive economic growth, a Trump boom could help lift anemic economies in Euorope and Asia.\n\nThose who hope Trump will not upset the geopolitical apple cart also question whether responsibility will sober the President-elect.\n\n\"There's just a whole different attitude and vibe when you're not in power as when you're in power,\" Obama said in his year-end press conference. \"What we have to see is how will the President-elect operate and how will his team operate when they've been fully briefed on all these issues, they have their hands on all the levers of government and they've got to got to start making decisions.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.2142856121063197, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1274, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.99310502421, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 7, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170102170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9042386185243303, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/12/opinions/new-direction-for-democrats-tasini/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Democrats, we need this new direction", "wordcount_as_scraped": 925, "date": "20161112220000", "story_content": "After Tuesday's election, Republicans will continue to hold power in 67 of the 98 state chambers, and, for the first time in history, will control every statehouse in the South. Republicans also upped their control of governors' mansions to 33 by winning races in Missouri, Vermont and New Hampshire (the North Carolina race is still undecided). \n\nFinally, notwithstanding tiny gains Tuesday by Democrats in congressional races, Republicans still hold a near-record margin in the House of Representatives (because of the 2010 shellacking in which Republicans gained 63 seats) and will likely increase their slim Senate majority in 2018 when the electoral map appears quite hostile to Democrats.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Democratic Party has shrinking power and influence over the shaping of public policy. \n\nThis new era of Republican control in Washington has startled -- some might say shocked -- many Democrats. However, looking a bit deeper, it shouldn't be a surprise; the party's national leadership has been a colossal failure for a long time. That makes the choice of who will lead the Democratic National Committee -- and steer the direction of a renewed party -- a matter of survival. \n\n And it has only itself to blame. This isn't simply a reflection of the incompetence of DNC leaders such as Debbie Wasserman Schultz, or the foisting on us of a truly weak presidential candidate. It goes to the core of what the party stands for and the guiding principles of its leaders.\n\nWe need new leadership, and as Sen. Bernie Sanders has argued persuasively, Rep. Keith Ellison fits that bill.\n\nAs I wrote this week, for a quarter of a century, the party embraced Clintonomics as a central guiding principle. Clintonomics, boiled down to its essence, is a kinder, gentler neoliberal philosophy: It embraces so-called free trade, deregulation, extols the free market and worships the \"honest\" financial sector (partly for campaign contributions), all with a light touch of regulation and meek taxes on the wealthy.\n\nBut that philosophy has been a resounding failure, not just in this country but around the world. Seeds of the revolt against Clinton-like neoliberalism can be found in the many rejections of governments in Europe and elsewhere. And, indeed, that anger, in many instances, has spawned Trump-like racism and bigotry.\n\nWhen Wasserman Schultz was shown the door (because of her manipulation of the party's primary contest on behalf of Hillary Clinton -- and because the party lost 910 state legislative seats during Barack Obama's presidency, the names of a number of possible replacements surfaced. Those included elected officials, longtime party activists and some leaders of Democratic-affiliated organizations. Most of them are precisely not the people the party needs. \n\nIt's not that former governors, past members of Congress or heads of advocacy groups are not competent. It is that they have either been longtime advocates of Clintonomics or, while the party spiraled downward in loss after loss because neoliberalism-lite alienated voters who had been robbed of their jobs and livelihoods, they sat silently at the DNC or in Washington.\n\nFormer Vermont Gov. Howard Dean is now in the race. Dean is running on his past advocacy of a 50-state political strategy and an undeserved reputation as a progressive. I give credit to Dean for speaking up against the Iraq War when, in the wake of 9/11, most Democrats were cowering before George W. Bush. \n\nBut, on economics, he was a pretty moderate governor who embraced most of the failed principles of Clintonomics. More recently, he's turned into a classic political insider. He's been working for a firm that lobbies the health care industry. He is the absolute wrong person to head up the party.\n\nEllison, however, is the right DNC chair to lead the party forward. He represents an urban-suburban district in Minnesota that is quite diverse: two-thirds white, 18% black, 9% Hispanic and 5% Asian. He is a Muslim. In other words, he understands, and can speak to, a huge swath of the public on matters of justice, race and tolerance.\n\nEllison was one of the few elected officials to support Sanders. But more important he rejects the model of the Democrats as a big-donor, Wall Street-driven party. As co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus -- the largest Democratic caucus -- Ellison has espoused for many years the principles that Sanders ran on in 2016, principles I believe would have carried Sanders to the White House had he been the Democratic nominee: Medicare for all, free college tuition, expanded Social Security benefits (in contrast to the hand-wringing, and factually incorrect, \"crisis\" rhetoric too many Democrats spew about Social Security), reining in and cutting down the size of the financial sector and a rational foreign policy where diplomacy is paramount.\n\nSome of the more traditional party bigwigs seem to be waking up to Ellison's vision. Sen. Charles Schumer, perhaps the most visible Democrat with longstanding ties to Wall Street, endorsed him. My hunch is that Schumer, a fairly canny political operative, sees two trends.

A global election report card", "wordcount_as_scraped": 802, "date": "20161107130000", "story_content": "Donald Trump has promised to \"make America great again.\"\n\nHillary Clinton thinks it's already an \"exceptional nation.\" \n\nHow does the US measure up to the rest of the world on key issues that are important to voters? Here's what we found:\n\nECONOMY\n\nThe economy is the top issue for voters, according to a July survey from the Pew Research Center. But if high unemployment rates were an issue during the 2008 and 2012 races (6.1% and 7.8%), that isn't the case this year. \n\nAmerica's jobless rate is hovering around 4.9%. It's the tenth best among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) -- a group that includes the world's richest nations. \n\nBut if the jobless rate is declining, income inequality is on the rise.\n\nThe US scores an abysmal 0.39 on the Gini Coefficient, which measures how evenly income is distributed. According to this metric, a score of 0 would mean every person made the same amount of money -- and a score of 1 would mean all the income was made by one person.\n\nIn simple terms: America's rich are getting richer and its poor are getting poorer. \n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nHealth care is a key issue for many voters, and that's no surprise -- the US spends more on health care per person than any other high-income country in the world.\n\nOn average, Americans dish out $1,810 more per head than the next highest spenders in Luxembourg, twice as much as Canadians, and almost nine times more than Mexicans, according to our calculations based on OECD data. \n\nHowever, the extra money doesn't deliver better health-related outcomes. Studies have shown that Americans have a shorter life expectancy and higher prevalence of chronic illnesses than citizens of most other wealthy nations.\n\nGUN POLICY\n\nAn estimated 310 million guns are owned by American civilians, according to the US Department of Justice, while the US Census Bureau estimates the current population of the US at 324 million people. \n\nThe US has more guns per capita than any other country in the world -- and one of the highest rates of death by firearm in the developed world, according to World Health Organization data.\n\nOur calculations based on OECD data show that Americans are 51 times more likely to be killed by gunfire than in the United Kingdom.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nThe US is home to the most immigrants in the world -- 19% of the world's total. \n\nBut when it comes to refugees -- last year 65 million people were displaced worldwide -- countries in the Middle East and Africa take the most. \n\nOf particular concern are the nearly five million Syrians who have fled since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011.\n\nMany voters are worried about an influx of Syrian refugees, but the US has accepted far fewer refugees than other Western countries.\n\nGermany has vowed to resettle one million Syrians. Canada said it would welcome 25,000. The US admitted just 1,900 Syrian refugees in the first four years of that country's conflict, although the number was expected to increase to more than 10,000 by the end of the fiscal year.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nLast December, 193 countries signed the Paris Agreement, a landmark deal that requires every country to reduce greenhouse emissions.\n\nPresident Barack Obama called the treaty \"a turning point for the world,\" but his successor will have to take drastic steps to decrease the country's huge carbon footprint.\n\nChina overtook the US as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses nearly a decade ago -- but in the developed world, the US is still the worst carbon polluter per capita, according to the World Bank.\n\nABORTION\n\nAbortion is another hot-button issue for many voters.\n\nAmerica is one of around 60 countries that provides legal access to safe abortions. Although abortion has been legal since 1973, access to treatment depends on laws determined by each state.\n\nAlthough it's almost always a big issue in presidential campaigns, the number of abortions in the US has been generally declining since the 1990s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTERRORISM\n\nThe terror threat also weighs heavily on the minds of many voters. \n\nSo how big of an impact does the threat of terror have on the US when compared to the rest of the world? Not very, according to the Global Terrorism Index. \n\nTerrorism is highly concentrated in a small number of countries -- and although the number of countries that have experienced a major terror attack is on the rise, the US still ranks low in both attacks and fatalities worldwide.\n\nVictims of terror attacks are mostly from the Middle East and Africa.\n\nCountries like India, Afghanistan and Pakistan have experienced terrorism over an extended period of time. Since 2000, the United States has only been featured once (in 2001) in the top ten countries most affected by terrorism.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.244694232940669, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 734, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.05703790891, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161107130000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.54223433242507, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/22/world/mh370-husband-speaks-out/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [4394]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1513, "scraper_regex": 1651}}, "headline": "Search for missing plane ends but a grieving husband's journey goes on", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1651, "date": "20170123180000", "story_content": "This time, the terrible news came in an email.\n\nAt least it wasn't a text, like the hasty, solitary line that exploded K.S. Narendran's world almost three years ago: \"We deeply regret that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived.\" \n\nHis wife of 25 years, Chandrika Sharma, was one of the 239 people aboard the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing on March 8, 2014. \n\nRELATED: Relatives of MH370 victims to appeal to Malaysian minister over search\n\nOn Tuesday, Narendran learned the search for the missing plane had been suspended. He saw the email a little before noon at his home in the southeastern Indian city of Chennai. \n\n\"An email is an improvement over an SMS message,\" he posted on Facebook. \"So, small mercies in an otherwise difficult period.\"\n\nThen came the media requests for interviews. India Today, BBC, The Guardian, Deutsche Welle, NPR. He had become a spokesman for the MH370 families. After a group statement on the search suspension was made public, every journalist wanted to know Narendran's reaction.\n\nHe expressed deep disappointment that the search was over. Anger that the governments of Malaysia, China and Australia had not followed a recent recommendation to search another 25,000 square kilometers north of the last search area. And betrayal: Those governments, he said, had made a commitment to the families of the lost passengers, and now they were reneging.\n\n\"I sensed my faith in the search and investigation erode precipitously, indeed faith in the entire gamut of institutional arrangements in place globally to keep us safe and secure, reassured that the journeys we undertake will indeed take us to our chosen destinations,\" he wrote on Facebook. \n\n\"MH370 didn't make it to Beijing. And we may never know why it didn't. We can never be sure that there will not be another tragedy.\"\n\nThe day seemed not to end. A flurry of emotions led to many moments of futility. Suspending the search was in part a message that the world was asking him to move on. As though he could.\n\nThe next morning, he boarded a cplane for a business trip to Mumbai on India's west coast. After MH370, Narendran developed a dread for planes. Sometimes in his seat, he role-plays and goes to a dark place. What was the experience like for his wife? \n\nThe question consumes him to the point where he, an articulate man with considerable language skills, finds himself at a loss for words. He has to virtually kick himself out of that state and force himself to sleep. It's his only way out. \n\n \"I don't even wait for the plane's doors to close,\" he tells me. \"I just try to sleep.\"\n\nI first spoke with Narendran a few days after MH370 vanished from the skies. I reached out to him after a mutual friend showed me his Facebook posts, and we have been in touch ever since.\n\nRELATED: One man's quiet reckoning on Flight 370\n\nThis time, we talk two days after he learned of the decision to stop the search. I want to ask him many things, but first he analyzes the mystery of the missing plane. He doesn't understand why the search was called off when debris -- confirmed to be from MH370 -- had been found off the coast of southern Africa.\n\n\"Common sense would suggest they would be hurrying to go and look there,\" he says. \"It is really puzzling. I have wracked my brain all this time on why then have been such a laggard on this front.\"\n\nThat leaves him wondering whether there is truth to conspiracy theories that suggest a cover-up.\n\n\"Maybe they know more than what was said and they want a closure to this investigation,\" he says.\n\nI can hear the frustration in his voice. I can hear the exhaustion.\n\nI ask him about a difficult question a radio interviewer posed the day before: \"Have you been able to have any kind of ceremony for her  -- funeral?\"\n\nHe attempted to answer: \"We have had no ceremony. It's hard to think of one when you don't know ... when was the end? Where was the end?\"\n\nNarendran and I have discussed this several times in our many conversations via phone, Skype, email and even in person at a Bangalore coffee house. He said in the past that his family and friends suggested some sort of memorial to help him let go, move forward, bring closure and all those clich\u00e9d things we say after loss. \n\nRELATED: Missing plane mystery: A hole in the clouds, an empty space on earth\n\nThe truth is he doesn't take kindly to rituals and besides, he wouldn't even know how to begin planning such a ceremony. It would drain his energy, he tells me. And for what?\n\nHow do you say goodbye to the person you loved most -- without knowing? \n\nIn the summer of 2015, he initiated the process of obtaining a death certificate for Chandrika. The pragmatic part of him said it was needed to settle insurance policies, bank accounts, property matters and other assets his wife held. \n\nAll he really had was a message from Malaysia Airlines confirming Chandrika was a passenger on the missing plane. A death certificate would provide documentation. \n\nBut it has to be issued by a court in Kuala Lumpur, and he is still waiting. One of his unsavory chores is to keep writing to ask about the status, and it adds to a host of other reminders. \n\nThey include the daily walks he used to take with Chandrika. After she was gone, he often imagined conversations with the woman he met in college and had shared life's joys and disappointments with.\n\nWhere have you been, Chandrika?Oh, many places. All at the same time. Can you believe that?When will you be back?Your guess is as good as mine.For good. That is.What if I am gone for good?\n\nHe fantasized about new facts being unearthed that might provide incontrovertible evidence. Then he could say: Case closed, like the ending of a Sherlock Holmes story. Time to move on. \n\nRELATED: Dear Chandrika: Conversations with my missing wife\n\nBut those facts never came, and for almost three years now, Narendran has lived life with crushing uncertainty. There were days that were more jarring than others:  when the missing plane was in the news, when debris was found, when the first anniversary came and then the second. And now, the end of the search.\n\nBut to him, day 364 was the same as day 365. It was another day without her.\n\nI sense that perhaps Narendran has begun to move on, however slow the progress. I ask him if he still speaks with his wife.\n\n\"My conversations lately have been with myself,\" he says. \"What I wish to do with my life. And I don't think I have answers yet.\"\n\nNor has the uncertainty abated as much as he would have liked.\n\nOne reason, he surmises, is his role as spokesman for Voice 370, the support group for families of the missing.\n\n\"That role travels with me 24 hours a day,\" he says. \"It has a way of keeping alive the questions and continues the agonizing.  I think the questions about finding answers, finding an explanation that is credible enough, sufficiently substantiated, remains very important. \n\n\"Why? I have often asked myself the same question. And I don't think I have a very clear answer. The sense of incredulity about all that's happened doesn't just go away. That something like this should ever have happened where there is neither a trace nor understanding or explanation of how this might have happened is very deeply disturbing.\"\n\nThen there all the relatives and friends who constantly ask him questions or want an update. \"Tell me what is happening,\" they say.\n\n\"There is always this underlying assumption that the families know something more than the rest of the world. And we don't,\" he says. \n\nSo it remains unfinished business.\n\n\"I also frankly believe there are larger questions of fairness, justice, accountability that can't be so easily put away,\" he says. \"There are levels of agitation and I tell myself: I can't just let this pass. I can't get on with life. I have not flushed my system of MH370.\"\n\nThese are the sorts of things Narendran is often not asked about in the myriad interviews he gives. How do you even begin in a 5-minute radio or TV segment? But I have learned about him over the course of our acquaintance.\n\nFrom the beginning, I felt his strength in the quietness of his voice and the power of his words. He is someone who doesn't always emote outwardly -- I've never heard him cry, although on several occasions he has brought tears to my eyes.\n\nHe tells me that writing about MH370 and his life without Chandrika has helped him enormously. It has forced him to learn about himself.\n\nPeople who suffer great pain or sorrow often find refuge in prayer and hope. Many of the families of MH370 held onto the hope that everyone on that plane was still alive. That included some of Narendan's relatives.\n\nBut Narendran was not one of them. He found comfort in his writing. It helps him gain insight on how he has been dealing with life after tragedy.\n\nThe eye cannot see itself, he tells me, quoting Shakespeare. \"I need to hear from others on how they see me and then reflect back on what resonates with me.\"\n\nWe end our conversation there. What I don't tell him is that I can see he has already done a lot of reflection; that he's already come a long way in his recovery. The search for the missing plane may have ended Tuesday, but what continues is Narendran's quest to find himself again.

In the former, sniper Micah Xavier Johnson in July killed five officers protecting activists demonstrating after the police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. Later that month, Iraq veteran Gavin Long ambushed three officers in Baton Rouge, fatally shooting them.\n\nMarconi's death marked the 60th fatal shooting of an officer in the US this year -- well ahead of the number for all of 2015 (41) but not quite on pace to top the 2011 total of 73, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. \n\nPolice arrested the suspect in the San Antonio shooting Monday afternoon, while the St. Louis suspect was killed following an exchange of gunfire with police, authorities said. The suspect in Gladstone was killed as well, while the Sanibel suspect was taken into custody after a shootout at a golf and tennis community, local media outlets reported. \n\nHere's what we know about each incident. \n\nSan Antonio\n\nMarconi, 50, pulled over a driver outside police headquarters just before noon Sunday and, after addressing the driver, returned to his patrol car to write a ticket. \n\nA man pulled up behind Marconi, exited his vehicle, approached Marconi's car and shot him in the head, McManus said. The suspect then shot Marconi again through the open window of the squad car, the police chief said.\n\n\"I believe the uniform was targeted,\" McManus said Monday at a news conference.\n\nMarconi, who had spent almost half of his life on the force, was killed, and the suspect drove away. \n\nPolice arrested 31-year-old Otis Tyrone McKane around 4:30 p.m. Monday while he was riding with a woman and a 2-year-old child in a car on Interstate 10, Chief McManus said. \n\n\"This is the person whose image we saw on surveillance,\" McManus said at a press conference. \"This is also the person we believe is responsible for the cold and calculated murder of Detective Marconi.\"\n\nSt. Louis\n\nInvestigators tracked down the suspect in the St. Louis police shooting as he was riding in a friend's car, which officers attempted to pull over, according to police. \n\nThe alleged gunman darted from the car, firing once at police, before officers returned fire, killing the suspect early Monday, police said. A pistol with a high-capacity magazine was recovered from the scene. \n\nAuthorities did not identify the suspect, but St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said the man was implicated in multiple robberies, a carjacking and a potential homicide. It's likely, Dotson said, that the suspect fired at the police officer Sunday night out of fear of being recognized as a suspect in the string of crimes. \n\nAround 7:30 p.m. Sunday, the gunman pulled up to a marked police SUV and shot a 46-year-old officer twice in the head. \n\nOfficer-involved shooting.

She stumped for her father during his election campaign and worked extensively on his behalf on causes such as child care and climate change.\n\nIn August, Ivanka even got her father to unveil his policy proposals to lower child care costs, a policy that she partly crafted and included as a part of her father's political platform. She declared child care as a \"top concern\" of hers and pointed out how her father is \"in a very unique position to do something about this problem.\"\n\n\"Little focus has been put on how best to alleviate enormous financial burdens child care places on low-income-and middle-income families,\" Ivanka Trump said, flawlessly following up on the theme of empowering working mothers, whom she introduced at the Republican National Convention. As recently as last month, Ivanka was personally calling members of Congress about child care legislation and tax deductions.\n\nHer expected work on climate change was also widely noted in the press after her meeting with actor and environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio. She was even rumored to be her father's choice as his climate czar.\n\nSo it is confusing, to say the least, to hear her now say that she will not be working in her father's administration.\n\nHowever, the truth is it really does not matter if Ivanka takes on an official role within the Trump White House or not.\n\nThe New York Times has already crowned her the most influential first daughter since Alice Roosevelt Longworth. And with Kushner being called the \"president in-law,\" the two are set to become the most powerful couple in Washington.\n\nJared Kushner, whom many credit with having won the presidency for Donald Trump, is also expected to be his father in-law's point policy person on the Middle East, with Trump even stating he believes Kushner could broker peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThis almost delusional faith in his family members, particularly his children, and reliance on them in business and now politics, has become a trademark of Trump's. His children make up his closest circle, and they are the only ones who appear to be able to provide him with any kind of check and balance.\n\nThis makes Ivanka and Jared perfectly positioned to influence the incoming President in ways even his closest advisers Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon or Reince Priebus could never manage.  \n\n\"They're ideal politicians,\" journalist Peter Davis says. \"Because you come away from any interaction thinking they're great and nice and don't have any deeper feeling about them.\"\n\nIn other words, they are much more likable than Donald Trump. That's not hard to see, and it makes the couple a critical asset to the entire Trump family and brand.\n\nAnd with Melania and Donald Trump adamant on spending as little time in Washington as possible, Ivanka and Jared will effectively be the de facto first couple of the United States, wielding more power together than any first daughter and son-in-law in presidential history.\n\nAs Vanity Fair explains: \"The Bush daughters got more attention for their college-age shenanigans than anything else while their father was in office. Chelsea Clinton and the Obama girls were too young to play any role other than First Daughter while they occupied the White House. But the Trumps, fiercely insular, and the Trump-Kushners, intensely striving, are different. And they are about to occupy an unprecedented place in American history.\"\n\nWhile presidents giving jobs to their kids is nothing new -- George W. Bush worked on his dad's campaign in 1988 and even helped staff the White House -- Washington has never had a president like Trump, and so has never seen the kind of formalized and powerful roles Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are set to enter.\n\nEven if Kushner's appointment as senior adviser ends up getting blocked and Ivanka gets no formal title, these two will never be far from the President's ear. And that's a huge advantage for Trump. Ivanka and Jared almost make you forget that one of the most unpopular presidential candidates in recent US history is about to become President.\n\nEven an avid Hillary Clinton supporter such as myself can see how the couple give Trump's White House a much more appealing image than Donald Trump could ever construct, providing a dangerous distraction from the fact they will have unlimited opportunity to advance their own political and business agendas.\n\nSo are the Trumps paving the way for a new brand of American political dynasties that defy ethics and conflicts of interests? That remains to be seen. But one thing is crystal clear: When it comes to Donald Trump's America, Ivanka and Jared will be ruling it.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.33076074719429, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 831, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.15604707297, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.9711191335740095, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/us/hate-crime-unit-new-york/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 572, "scraper_regex": 651}}, "headline": "Spike in hate crimes prompts special NY police unit", "wordcount_as_scraped": 651, "date": "20161121010000", "story_content": "An \"explosion\" in hate crimes since Election Day has prompted the creation of a special police unit to fight the uptick in New York, Gov.

In many ways it has gotten worse, [turning] into a social crisis that now challenges our identity as a state and as a nation and our people,\" he said.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump wasn't specifically mentioned in his church address, but Cuomo has in the past criticized Trump and vowed in a New York Daily News op-ed that he would \"reject the hateful attitudes that pervaded throughout the 2016 campaign.\"\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has counted more than 700 incidents of hateful harassment and intimidation since the election. \n\nA toll-free hot line that Cuomo launched on November 15 to connect New Yorkers with the state Division of Human Rights to report incidents of bias and discrimination has received more than 400 calls since Friday, according to Cuomo's office.\n\nCalling this kind of prejudice a \"social poison [in] the fabric of our nation,\" the governor cited a number of recent incidents, including a scourge of swastika graffiti and the case of black freshmen at the University of Pennsylvania being sent pictures of lynchings and racial slurs.\n\nCuomo also vowed to set up a legal defense fund for immigrants who fear prosecution under a Trump administration. He said the fund would be the first of its kind. \n\nThe plan, he said, would be to set up a public-private partnership \"to provide immigrants who can't afford their own defense the legal assistance they need ... because in New York, we believe in justice for all,\" Cuomo said.\n\nHe added, \"If there is a move to deport immigrants then I say start with me. I am a son of immigrants. Son of Mario Cuomo, who is the son of Andrea Cuomo, a poor Italian immigrant who came to this country without a job, without money, or resources and he was here only for the promise of America.\"\n\nCuomo's plans also include the expansion of New York's Human Rights Law to protect students who are bullied or discriminated against.\n\nWe don't care the color of your skin or how much money you have in your pocket - if you accept the American ideal, we will work with you.\u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) November 20, 2016\n\nNew York Police Department Commissioner James O'Neill told a New York radio station on Sunday he was disturbed by the trends. \n\n\"We've had an uptick in hate crimes, actually a little bit more than an uptick. We're up 31% from last year. We had at this time last year 250, this year we have 328, specifically against the Muslim population in New York City -- we went up from 12 to 25, and anti-Semitic is up, too, by 9% from 102 to 111,\" O'Neill said. \n\n\"I have no scientific evidence as to why, but you've been paying attention to what's been going on in the country over the last year or so and the rhetoric has increased, and I think that might have something to do with it,\" O'Neill added. \n\nCuomo said on Sunday that New York's tolerance will lead the way for the rest of the nation, and his announcement came as an \"anti-hate\" rally was held in a Brooklyn park vandalized with swastikas and pro-Trump graffiti.\n\nThe rally, at a playground named after the late Beastie Boy Adam Yauch, was attended by band member Adam Horovitz, better known as Ad-Rock.\n\n\"Keep your eyes open, stand up for each other. This is homegrown terrorism for real,\" Horovitz told the crowd. \"I reject Donald Trump's vision for America.

I am one of the lawyers on the suit.   \n\nThe lawsuit is a response to an extraordinary situation in which the President of the United States is benefiting from business relationships with foreign countries. Needless to say, those countries have a deeply vested interest in presidential decisions regarding trade and military policy. \n\nThe framers of our country anticipated that such a situation would occur, and that it would lead to corruption. They included in the Constitution a clause \u2014 the so-called emoluments clause --  that prohibits officers of the United States from accepting anything of value from foreign governments without explicit congressional permission. \n\nPresident Trump is violating that clause. His businesses are taking payments from entities owned by the governments of China, the UAE, he is about to be paid by Kuwait, and he is getting benefits and possibly payments from dozens of other countries. \n\nOf course, because he has not released his tax returns publicly, we do not know the full scope of the payments and benefits.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by CREW asks for a declaratory judgment and an injunction of these illegal payments. In the course of that lawsuit, we will need to get discovery of those tax returns so we can figure out the full scope of the payments. \n\nCREW did not want to have to go to the courts and had hoped President Trump would have liquidated his assets to avoid conflicts before taking office.\n\nBut besides Trump's curt statement that the lawsuit is \"without merit,\" what do we know about his approach towards the Constitution? His lawyers' public response has been to misread and trivialize what the framers of our constitution saw as a foundational American rule.\n\nAt a press conference held a few weeks before President Trump took office, his lawyer Sherri Dillon said, \"No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument.\"  \n\nThis is wrong on two counts. \n\nFirst, it is wrong because the framers absolutely would have considered a hotel bill an emolument. The relevant clause forbids those holding an \"office under the United States\" from accepting \"gifts\" OR \"emoluments\"  \"of any kind whatever.\"\n\nSecond, it is wrong because it suggests the scope of Trump's foreign payments and benefits are from hotel bills; in fact they include substantial leases, substantial payments for \"The Apprentice\" and spinoffs, and substantial development-related benefits in many countries. \n\nLikewise, Dillon's announcement that Trump will donate profits from foreign governments' payments to his hotels suggests the President is above the law, and can unilaterally decide to fashion his own solution to a conflicted situation, instead of following the remedy required by the Constitution. By first accepting the payments, and then donating them, Trump is still in the practice of receiving profits he is not legally allowed to receive. \n\nCREW's lawsuit asks for a declaratory judgment and an injunction: All it wants is for the unconstitutional behavior to stop. Let us hope that before it gets to court, President Trump and his team change their posture, and stop violating foundational anti-corruption principles of our country.

Worse, it undermines our national security and puts the lives of US citizens at greater risk. \n\nSince the attacks of 9/11, there have been no successful foreign terrorist attacks on our homeland. Thanks to the tireless work of national security professionals, we have implemented a sophisticated mechanism to identify bad actors well before they cross our borders. With every new threat, the process is enhanced. \n\nAfter the Paris terror attacks, President Obama strengthened the visa waiver program and imposed stricter requirements on partner countries. Until now, these measures have been updated, taking into account our current capabilities, our key strategic alliances, and the impacts on the American public. The latest Executive Order turns this commonsense process on its head.\n\nIn one fell swoop, the Executive Order dismantles our entire immigration policy. This is not just about Syrians or refugees. Under this new policy, a widowed mother with her young children fleeing ISIS or Assad's brutal persecution are prevented from securing safe haven; an Iraqi translator, targeted because of his service to US forces, is turned away; thousands of Burmese, Congolese, and Central Americans are denied entry.\n\nThe policy was clearly signed without any regard for implementation or understanding of our existing screening processes. Tens of thousands of refugees are stuck mid-process; dozens are stranded at airports; dual-nationals are uncertain whether they can travel or if they will be stopped at our borders. Resources are bound to become tied up in litigation instead of targeting real threats.\n\nThe Executive Order is wrong-headed. The refugee admissions program is the worst path a potential terrorist could take if they intend to commit violence in the United States. The entire admissions process takes at least 18 months and often years to complete. The applicants are subjected to exhaustive interviews, biometrics checks, and fraud and national security analyses.  \n\nThe United States prioritizes women, children, and people who have survived torture. And if there is any lingering doubt about the applicant's intent, they are denied entry.\n\nFurthermore, rather than make us safer, Trump's policy weakens our defenses against radical extremism. By leaving vulnerable refugees stranded around the world, it foments anger toward the US, feeding ISIS' narrative that the United States is anti-Muslim. It risks alienating our important allies who are critical partners in our current counter-terrorism efforts, especially Muslim countries like Turkey and Jordan.  \n\nIt also points the finger in the wrong direction. Far more US citizens and legal permanent residents have committed a terrorist attack in the United States than a refugee or recent migrant. And no Syrian refugee has ever attacked the United States.\n\nFinally, Trump's Executive Order jeopardizes our economic security. The elimination of all visa interview waivers will slow our travel and tourism industry, which now generates $2.1 trillion for the US economy, and supports 15.1 million American jobs.\n\nIf President Trump is serious about protecting us from foreign terrorists, he should concentrate instead on strengthening our alliances with partners in Europe and the Middle East who share vital information and work with these allies to beef up their capabilities to interdict terrorists before they leave their countries. \n\nHe must engage and cooperate with national security and diplomatic professionals who have dedicated their entire careers to keeping the US safe.  And he should support community efforts to counter violent extremism. \n\nWe cannot allow the President to play politics with our nation's security.  All our lives are at stake.

Putin and Syria's President consider the ceasefire negotiations \"an important step for a final solution of the crisis,\" the statement added.    \n\nTurning point\n\nA successful nationwide ceasefire hinges on many fighting factions laying down arms -- groups from Iraq, Iran and Lebanon are also fighting alongside the forces of Assad's regime.\n\nIn a news conference in Turkey's capital, the legal adviser for the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army, Osama Abu Zeid, called the agreement \"a complete truce with no exceptions or preconditions\" that included \"all areas and military factions in Syrian opposition territory.\" \n\n\"The main goal is improving the living conditions for Syrian citizens,\" he said.\n\n\"Our message to the Syrian population (is) that our fingers will remain on the trigger and we will present all sacrifices and we will take every path that will alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people.\" \n\nHadi Al Bahra of the Istanbul-based opposition Syrian National Coalition told CNN on Thursday that the ceasefire negotiations involved the military and humanitarian sides of the conflict, not Syria's political future. \n\n\"Assad is a big part of the problem; he doesn't have the capacity to really go forward with the peace agreement,\" he said of Syria's President.\n\nThe Syrian rebel group Ahrar al-Sham did not sign the ceasefire agreement, a spokesman said. \n\n \"Ahrar al-Sham has a number of reservations over the proposed agreement and the negotiations,\" the spokesman, Ahmad Qura Ali, said via Twitter. \"We will make clear our reservations in due course.\"\n\nPutin's announcement comes after several attempts at ceasefires by the international community crumbled. \n\nIt also follows several ceasefire agreements brokered by Turkey and Russia in the city of Aleppo this month. Most were broken, but a final one held and allowed the evacuations of tens of thousands of rebels and civilians from the city's east, which had been under the control of rebel groups for more than four years.\n\nThe Syrian regime then gained full control of Aleppo, a major turning point that has limited the opposition's military and political options. \n\nTurkey and Russia have differed, however, in their stance on Assad -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last month that Turkish forces entered Syria to help end Assad's rule. Russia is Assad's most powerful ally and has propped up his regime since September 2015 with airstrikes.\n\nErdogan on Thursday said the ceasefire \"opportunity in Syria shall not be missed.\" \n\n\"The parties in Syria will not expand the territories they have control over,\" he added. \n\nPutin said Russia would begin scaling back its military presence in Syria, though it would continue to support the \"legitimate Syrian government in its struggle with terrorism.\"\n\nUS sidelined\n\nThe UN Security Council has been widely criticized for failing to find a solution to the Syrian war. \n\nRussia has shot down several resolutions on the conflict, using its veto power as a permanent member of the council.\n\nA spokesperson for the UN Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura welcomed the ceasefire, saying in a statement that a cessation of hostilities was a \"cornerstone\" of a UN Security Council resolution from 2015 on Syria.\n\nThe statement said that de Mistura hoped the agreement would \"save civilian lives, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance across Syria, and pave the way for productive talks in Astana\" in Kazakhstan.\n\nBut the statement also said that the developments should contribute to negotiations convened by the UN in planned Syria talks on February 8.    \n\nTurkey and Russia appear to be sidelining the United States, which has led an international coalition to fight ISIS in Syria and has vehemently opposed any attempt to keep Assad in power.\n\nTurkey has worked with the US to fight ISIS in Syria, but it has worked more closely with Russia in recent months.\n\nUS State Department spokesman Mark Toner acknowledged that Washington was not part of the negotiations but said the agreement was \"a positive development.\"\n\n\"An inclusive Syrian-led political process between the Syrian regime and the opposition is critical for establishing a durable settlement to this conflict,\" he said in a statement. \n\nRussia has long accused the US of arming what it considers terrorist organizations, while Turkey has made similar claims in the past few days.\n\nBut Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed hope Thursday that US President-elect Donald Trump would support Russia's direction on Syria's crisis settlement, Russian state media reported. \n\nAn estimated 400,000 people have been killed in Syria's brutal conflict -- a civil war that has drawn in several world powers. \n\nMeanwhile, the US mission in Syria said Thursday that ISIS gang leader Abu Jandal al-Kuwaiti had been killed Monday in a coalition airstrike.\n\nHe was involved in the use of suicide vehicles, homemade bombs and chemical weapons against the Syrian Democratic Forces, the mission said in a statement. \n\nHe was a member of the militant group's war committee and was involved in ISIS' recapture of the ancient city of Palmyra, the statement said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.14579772949219, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 523, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 9, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.04511531354, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229130000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 6.30975143403442, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/07/politics/secret-service-director-trump/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "EXCLUSIVE: 'No friction at all' with Trump's private security, Secret Service chief says", "wordcount_as_scraped": 963, "date": "20170107210000", "story_content": "US Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy wants to set the record straight about President-elect Donald Trump's private security team and whether it's causing conflict with his agents.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN -- his first since Trump's election -- Clancy also offered a wide-ranging look at the unique logistical challenges of providing security for the President-elect's large family and securing his New York residence.\n\nMost of all, however, he wanted to push back against suggestions that there were conflicts between the Secret Service and the private security team that's protected Trump for years. Politico reported last month that Trump's private team \"bristled\" at the Secret Service's desire to take the lead in protecting Trump and in some cases, they had gotten in the way of the agency's protocols.\n\n\"There is no friction at all\" with Trump's private team, insisted Clancy, who said his agency has \"sole responsibility\" for protecting the President and the first family. He added that there is no overlap between the private team and his agency.\n\n\"They are not in our meetings,\" Clancy said. \"They are not armed. They are more of a staff function than a security function. We don't interact with them.\"\n\nHe explained that while Trump's private team is there to ensure public events run smoothly and there are no disruptions from the crowd, Secret Service agents are the only ones protecting the President-elect.\n\nAlthough protesters have been a feature of many Trump campaign stops and some have pledged to protest the inauguration, Clancy said that unless a protester is a direct physical threat to the President, the Secret Service will not intervene.\n\n\"We want to make sure everyone has their First Amendment rights,\" he said, adding that if a protester is removed, that is a decision made by event staff. \n\nTrump has named the head of his private security team, retired NYPD officer Keith Schiller, as his director of Oval Office operations and deputy assistant to the President. Clancy said Schiller serves as a \"conduit for information\" between the agents and the President-elect and helps inform the Secret Service about any changes to Trump's itinerary. \n\n\"He has a larger family. He's got five children, grandchildren, so that will require more assets, more personnel,\" Clancy said.\n\nHe noted that Trump's children are \"young adults, so they're very active, they travel.\" But Trump's Fifth Avenue residence in New York City, Trump Tower -- where future First Lady Melania Trump plans to reside through next spring with the couple's youngest son -- presents a different challenge.\n\nIt's not unusual for a first lady to be in a different location than the President, Clancy said, but he acknowledged the new Trump arrangement represents a \"longer period of time\" than usual -- even though his agency would never advise the first family to change their preferred living arrangements. \n\n\"There are enough inconveniences when you take on this role as President and first lady,\" Clancy said. \"We don't want to add to that.\" \n\nTrump Tower\n\nThe midtown Manhattan building sits on one of the busiest streets in the country. Clancy said the goal is to provide robust security while simultaneously allowing local businesses and residents to continue using the building. \n\n\"We are bringing in more resources\" to handle the situation, he said, adding that the Secret Service is working to establish a command post inside Trump Tower that would be \"pretty close to an entire floor.\"\n\nAccording to Jared Horowitz, who works for the company responsible for available commercial space at Trump Tower, the floors available to rent -- with the average floor space running between 13,500 to 15,500 square feet -- cost about $1.5 million a year. Asked about the high price tag, Clancy said they were required by law \"to pay for the property that we need,\" adding that the space was \"critical to the protection of the President, so it's something that needs to be done.\" \n\n\"It's actually no different than what we've done with other presidents,\" Clancy continued. \"We rented some property in Chicago when President Obama first became president for his trips when he was going out to Chicago. So, this is typically what we do.\" \n\nRegarding the government's negotiations with their new landlord, the Trump Organization, Clancy said, \"They're very fair with us. They understand the responsibilities we have and they've been very accommodating.\"              \n\nProtecting the President\n\nClancy, a 27-year veteran of the Secret Service who ran the presidential protection division during the first years of Barack Obama's presidency, noted there are more similarities than differences among the presidents they protect.\n\n\"I don't think any of them sleep very well,\" he said. \"They're also very schedule-oriented. They all run on tight schedules,\" adding that, \"They're all involved in athletics. Some enjoy golf, some enjoy running, some biking.\"\n\nIn the past year and a half that the Secret Service has been working with Trump, Clancy said he has met with him a couple of times, describing him as \"very gracious and very appreciative\" of the Secret Service.\n\nAsked how Trump was adjusting to motorcades and having round-the-clock teams of armed agents guarding him, Clancy said \"it's unusual for anyone to get used to it, but he has been terrific.\" \n\nThreats in the age of Twitter\n\nTwo newer areas the Secret Service is focused on are social media and cyberthreats, an area of particular concern given Trump's frequent use of Twitter and mounting concerns regarding US cybersecurity. \n\nThe director said the Secret Service now has a specific division focused on potential social media threats. He also said they are deploying the same experts that provide cyber security for the US financial system in order to ensure that facilities visited by the president are defended from cyber-attacks. \n\n\"Everything keeps me up night,\" he said of the array of threats. \n\nBut, he added, \"that's our business.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 948, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.39359889971, "HarmVirtue": 18, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170107210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.48101265822785, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/18/travel/russia-cold-war/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1157, "scraper_regex": 1278}}, "headline": "For your eyes only: Moscow's top secret Cold War relics ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1278, "date": "20161219040000", "story_content": "The Cold War: a time of border standoffs, spy-versus-spy intrigues and the bristling tensions of the Berlin Wall.\n\nToday Moscow's glittering malls and stylish cafes might seem light years away from the gray concrete and paranoia of that era -- a period that stretched from the end of World War II in 1945 to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 -- but its remnants are everywhere.\n\nFrom bunker complexes to rusting MiG fighter jets to the vestiges of long-defunct secret weapons programs, Moscow is a living museum of the epoch that shaped the 20th century.\n\nTaking a trip through this often overlooked part of Russia's history is to time travel to a recent past when the world had two superpowers, two ideologies and spies dispatched dissidents with poisoned umbrella tips. \n\nWe have compiled a list of these obscure, yet easily accessible, attractions set to delight Cold War buffs, military hardware enthusiasts and aficionados of Soviet-era office furniture.\n\nBunker 42\n\nIf it didn't actually exist, it could have been invented by the set designers of \"Dr Strangelove.\"\n\nTagansky Protected Command Point, commonly known as Bunker 42, is as close to an underground city as the Cold War gets.\n\nSome 65 meters below Moscow's traffic-choked streets, this 7,000-square-meter facility was designed as a command center for the Soviet air force's long-distance strike force. \n\nStarted in 1951, when nuclear tensions were at their zenith, it was capable of withstanding a nuclear missile attack and could accommodate 3,000 people for up to 90 days in complete isolation from the outside world.\n\nOnly declassified in 1995, the complex is now run by a private company that has turned one of the Soviet Union's best-kept secrets into a museum.

So much so, they were even christened like ships with a splash of champagne on the bow. \n\nUsing what's known in aerodynamics as the \"ground effect\" -- the science that makes airborne bodies easier to control when they approach a hard surface -- the ekranoplan mimicked the flight of swans or pelicans when they use ground effect to skim just above the surface of the water.\n\nThe ekranoplan could reach astounding speeds of more than 400 kilometers per hour and even had amphibious abilities, moving over ice or flat land as easily at it sped above the surface of the water. \n\nThe Soviet Union developed a number of ekranoplan prototypes for military use, including one that was so large and strange that when it was spotted by US spy satellites in the mid-1960s it was dubbed \"the Monster of the Caspian.\"\n\nDespite a promising start, ekranoplans never caught on and the program was scrapped in the 1980s. Like seaplanes, ekranoplans were largely at the mercy of sea conditions even when flying conditions were good.\n\nOther exhibits at the Russian Navy Museum include the pride of the Soviet Union's Cold War fleet, from a Tango-class B-396 submarine to Scat assault hovercraft.\n\nThe chance to get on board a real Soviet submarine is one of the museum's major draws. The submarine Novosibirsk Komsomolets entered service in 1980 and served in the Soviet and, later, Russian navies until 1998. \n\nIn 2003 it made its last voyage from the White Sea, in northern Russia, to Moscow through the country's inland waterways.\n\nThe submarine's different sections have been furnished with items that give an idea of how cramped conditions were for the vessel's 78 submariners.

Granted the laws aren't often enforced. (It's more of a \"someone gently asks you to stop\" kind of thing.)  But that doesn't mean you should test the rules. \n\nAlabama: No photos at polling places. That being said, no one's been prosecuted and any violators will simply be asked to stop. \n\nArizona: You can't take photos inside or within 75 feet of a polling place. You CAN take a photo of a ballot that was mailed to you. \n\nCalifornia: Ballot selfies WILL be legal in California ...in January 2017. As of now, they're against the law ... that isn't really enforced. \n\nColorado: There are two pending cases that may overturn the law, but for now it's illegal to take pics AND to share or show your completed ballot to another person. \n\nFlorida: No go in voting places. Yes to pics of mail-in ballots. \n\nGeorgia: Can't take pics at a polling place, or of any ballots or voting equipment. The Secretary of State's office says it \"strongly discourage[s] ballot selfies.\"\n\nIllinois: It's a felony to take pictures that show how you voted, and it's also illegal to take pictures inside polling places. If you do get popped for a violation, the state Election Board says the case would be decided on the county level. \n\nIowa: No photos are allowed in the voting booths, but the law's unclear on whether that also means polling places. \n\nMaryland: Maryland goes a level beyond, and actually bans the use of any electronic communication devices. That, obviously, means you can't take pics of ballots either. \n\nMichigan: There's a legal back-and-forth going on, but for now, no cameras in polling places. \n\nNevada: Can't take pictures in polling places, because it's considered photographing \"the conduct of voting.\" \n\nNorth Carolina: The only way you can take pictures is if you have the permission of the voter (you) -- and the permission of the chief judge of the precinct (not you). So, it's probably a pass. \n\nTennessee: Tennessee's laws are kinda unclear, because they state \"no phones\" but also have a mobile app to help with voting. However, the law also says you can't take pictures or talk on the phone. Take a lesson from Justin Timberlake: It's not worth the hassle. \n\nTexas: No photos inside the booths or within 100 feet of the polling place. If you do get caught, you won't be arrested, per se, but you will be asked to stop. And why would you want to inconvenience people with all of that? \n\nWest Virginia: Here's the law: \"No person may enter a voting booth with any recording or electronic device in order to record or interfere with the voting process.\" So, basically, no selfies. However, once you're outside the precinct, snap away. \n\nBack to top\n\nExercise selfie restraint\n\nLots of state laws don't specifically cover voting booth pictures, but are pretty clear on marked ballots. There's plenty of reasons why this is totally understandable, but the most important one has to do with vote buying. There's no way anyone can know who you voted for unless you provide them with photo evidence. \n\nAlaska: There's a statute in the books prohibiting selfies with your ballot, but no one's been prosecuted. The state says it's considered creating a PSA reminding voters of ballot secrecy. \n\nMassachusetts: No selfies with your ballot, people. But here again, there's little the state can do to enforce the law, says Brian McNiff, spokesman for the Secretary of the Commonwealth. \n\nMinnesota: Two statues say showing others your marked ballot is a no-no. And that's what taking a pic or a video does. \n\nMississippi: Just don't in Mississippi. In 2008 & 2012, some teens who were voting for the 1st time broke the law. The Attorney General fined them $25.  Your fine could be higher -- up to $100, says Holly Robertson of the State Board of Elections.\n\nMissouri: The law here, like the others in this list, deals with showing your ballot. So, Stephanie Fleming of the Secretary of State's Office says, check with your polling place just to be sure before you start snapping.\n\nNew Jersey: There are moves to change the law, but for now you can't show your completed ballot to others, which means no pictures of it. \n\nNew Mexico: The law says no showing your completed ballot to anyone. Ken Ortiz of the Secretary of State's Office says the law's hard to enforce and nobody's been prosecuted under it.\n\nNew York: Don't take a picture of your ballot. Simple. \n\nSouth Carolina: Selfies of your ballot = Against the law. But Chris Whitmire with the state Election Office didn't know if anyone's ever been prosecuted for it.\n\nSouth Dakota: Don't take a picture of your ballot. Mark it, fold it, refold it and cast your vote.\n\nWisconsin: The state would rather you not take a pic with your marked ballot. Reid Magney of the Election Commission says he's not aware of any prosecutions, but why open yourself up to a complaint?\n\nBack to top\n\nSelfie expression is fine\n\nHere's the bottom line: Voting is a serious affair, and states would like to protect the sanctity of this American right. If you still simply must selfie, go ahead. Just consider the inimitable words of Ian Malcom from Jurassic Park: You may be so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you may not stop to think if you should. \n\nArkansas: The only law here is that you are allowed to cast your vote in private, says Daniel Schultz with the Board of Elections. \n\nConnecticut:  Snap away. \n\nDelaware: There's no specific law against any of this, but officials do encourage people not to use their cellphones in polling places. \n\nHawaii: Okay, so, you can take a selfie in the voting booth, and you can share photos of your marked ballot. However, according to Nedielyn Bueno of the Office of Elections, you can't take selfies OUTSIDE the voting booth because polling places don't allow the use of electronic devices. \n\nIdaho: There are now laws against it, but photography is discouraged. \n\nIndiana: The state enacted a law that banned ballot selfies. But a federal judge barred it from going into effect. So, you're good to go ... for now.\n\nKansas: Election Director Brian Caskey with the Board of Elections says there's a law about ballot disclosure, but ballot selfies don't fall under it. \n\nKentucky: Good to go. \n\nLouisiana: Selfies are allowed because your vote is private until YOU make it public!\n\nMaine: Snap away.\n\nMontana: Snap away.\n\nNebraska: Snap away.\n\nNew Hampshire: A federal appeals court ruled a statewide ballot selfie ban unconstitutional. So you're good to go.\n\nNorth Dakota: No issues here.\n\nOhio: \"The Secretary does not believe posting a photo of your vote on social media is a problem,\" says Joshua Eck, the spokesman for the Secrety of State's Office. \n\nOklahoma: They advise voters not to take selfies, but there is no current penalty, and no history of prosecution.\n\nOregon: There are no laws prohibiting pictures of your ballot.\n\nPennsylvania: The state has sent guidance to polling places that it is within people's 1st Amendment rights to take selfies.\n\nRhode Island: Once you're in the booth, you can take pictures. No can do outside the booth.\n\nUtah: Go for it.\n\nVermont: No laws regarding selfies or photos at all.\n\nVirginia: Take a pic and make it good.\n\nWashington: It's not recommended, but you're fine.\n\nWyoming: Nothing says you can't, but don't be disruptive.\n\nBack to top", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.4771049022674598, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1179, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 21, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.920967086519999, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161107140000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 2.6293469041560598, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/28/middleeast/iraq-mosul-operations/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 642, "scraper_regex": 678}}, "headline": "Iraq's PM says ISIS could be defeated 'within 3 months'  ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 678, "date": "20161229230000", "story_content": "Iraqi security forces are advancing in Mosul and could defeat ISIS in the country \"within three months,\" said Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. \n\nThe prime minister made his remarks Tuesday in a Baghdad press conference that was broadcast on Iraqiya State TV. His comments came as Iraqi forces prepare for the next phase of military operations in its fight to wrest the city of Mosul from ISIS control. \n\nSince October, a coalition of Iraqi-led forces including the Iraqi army, counter-terrorism forces, federal police, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shiite-led paramilitary forces have pushed to end ISIS' brutal rule in Mosul. The city remains the last major stronghold of ISIS after the militant group seized control in 2014. \n\nWhat began as a rapid push into the city in early November has turned into a block-by-block war, with ISIS inflicting high casualty rates on advancing Iraqis.\n\nSecurity officials told CNN that ISIS' vicious tactic of using civilians as human shields is slowing down the advance of Iraqi troops in eastern Mosul.\n\nMosul surrounded by Iraqi forces\n\nIraqi forces have accomplished its goals for the first phase of its Mosul military operations, Iraqi Ministry of Defense spokesman Brig. Gen. Tahsin Ibrahim told CNN on Wednesday. These goals consist of surrounding Mosul and recapturing most towns and villages around the city. Some 100,000 troops have converged simultaneously around Mosul. \n\nThe second phase of the operation is to continue liberating neighborhoods in the eastern and western sides of Mosul from ISIS, protect civilians and provide safe routes for the civilians who wish to leave, Ibrahim said.\n\n\"The second phase will witness changes in the military methods of fighting ISIS in Mosul and especially after Iraqi troops gained good experience of fighting them there in the past weeks,\" Ibrahim said.\n\n\"Iraqi troops can't use artilleries and tanks in the streets of Mosul and thus these things would slow down the advances of our security forces. We are now facing significant challenges due to the presence of civilians but we will continue until we liberate the entire city.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Iraqi's prime minister said there are no plans to have US combat troops to fight along with Iraqi security forces, calling such media reports \"an outright lie.\" \n\n\"There is not a single foreign soldier fighting on the Iraqi soil,\" al-Abadi said. \"Foreign troops are here for only training and logistics purposes.\"\n\nLast bridge over Tigris\n\nOn Monday, a US-led coalition airstrike disabled the last functioning bridge over the Tigris River in Mosul that had linked the city's east to west. \n\nThe US-led coalition confirmed the damage in a statement released Wednesday, but didn't provide additional details. ISIS' media wing, Amaq,  posted a video showing the collapsed section of that bridge, also known as \"Old Bridge\" and the \"Iron Bridge.\" \n\nIt had been the last one standing in Mosul over the Tigris River after four others were damaged in coalition airstrikes in the past two months. \n\nTaking out the bridges enables Iraqi-led forces to contain ISIS fighters and cut off their supplies and access to reinforcement fighters.\n\nBut it also restricts the movement of civilians. The International Organization for Migration had expressed concern that taking out the key bridges would trap civilians inside Mosul after the fourth bridge had been damaged in a US airstrike in late November. \n\nCivilians caught in the middle\n\nThe human toll in Mosul has been significant with more than 114,000 people displaced from their homes, according to UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\n\"As many as one million people are estimated to remain out of reach of humanitarian assistance in Mosul city. Of particular concern are reports of food and water shortages\" the UN said in a statement released last week. \n\nTrauma injuries among civilians are a significant concern in eastern Mosul city with 973 injuries reported last week, mainly from gunshots, mines and indirect fire, according to the OCHA statement.\n\nAid organizations say they fear the fighting could result in the displacement of more than a million people.

You feel powerless? Do I have consent, Will?\" A few strategic blows to the face induce the frat boy to admit his crime, and the figure stands to leave \u2014 but not quite yet. \n\n\"If you ever do to anyone else what you did to Beth...I will be back,\" the figure says, punctuating the warning by burying a knife in the rapist's leg and slipping back out the window. In a few minutes' time, the black mask is gone and we meet Jules, sorority girl-turned-campus avenger.\n\nThe series, created by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson and set at the fictional Darlington University, premiered a week after the 2016 election,  and comes along at a great time. After all, we've somehow just elected a president who has spent most of his life in the public eye, demonstrating how little he values women's humanity, and who all but corroborated sexual-assault allegations against him by bragging that, as a rich and famous man, he could \"grab [women] by the pussy,\" with zero consequences.\n\nAmid the instant flood of accounts of hate speech, swastika grafitti, and assaults on Muslim and black citizens, reports are coming in from women around the country who have been sexually harassed and groped by men who tell them with glee and menace that they live in Trump's America now. Did I say it's a good time for this show? Correction: It's the perfect time.\n\nElection Day notwithstanding, the past several years have brought some progress in how we as a culture discuss the issues of sexual consent and violence. Long-rumored abuses perpetrated by famous men \u2014 among them Bill Cosby and Canadian broadcast personality Jian Ghomeshi \u2014 were pushed out into the open. The case of Brock Turner, the Stanford student given a laughably brief sentence for a clear-cut case of rape, as well as that of the high-school athletes in Steubenville, Ohio, went scorchingly viral. The Obama administation launched It's On Us, a nationwide awareness program dedicated to addressing and combating sexual violence on college campuses. California, New York, and Michigan adopted affirmative-consent \u2014 also known as \"yes means yes\"\u2014 laws that mandate teaching that nothing short of a vocal \"yes\" counts as consent. In interviews, CNN's Anderson Cooper used and placed emphasis on the phrase \"sexual assault\" \u2014 as in, it's not just \"locker-room talk\" \u2014 to name the behavior Donald Trump boasted about on a hot mic.\n\nHowever, the fact that more than a few people are angry that this dialogue has evolved \u2014 say, the people who scoff at affirmative-consent laws as \"sex policing\" \u2014 is perhaps more telling than the evolution itself. Entitlement to female attention and bodies, is, as Trump so crassly noted, one of the long-guaranteed spoils of success, whether in college athletics or Hollywood or high-flying global real estate. Questioning that \u2014 or, worse, fighting against it \u2014 is still a taboo. Women continue to live and work alongside their attackers because telling the truth often means opening up a world of further torment.\n\nIt's this reality that \"Sweet/Vicious\" takes aim at. Jules can't yet avenge her own rape \u2014 the perpetrator is her best friend's boyfriend \u2014 but she and Ophelia, the trust-fund hacker who cracks her secret identity and joins the cause, can act on behalf of women who aren't taken seriously by police, whose cases have been dismissed by the college, who have learned that the system that should protect them won't. \n\nPeople will probably be angry at \"Sweet/Vicious,\" too. When it comes to female vigilantes, audiences \u2014 when they like them at all \u2014 like them ravished as graphically as possible before they get their revenge, if precursors like \"I Spit on Your Grave,\" \"Ms. 45,\" and \"Irreversible\" are any indication. (Though the show's wry humor also recalls the movie \"Thelma and Louise,\" as well as the quieter '90s indie \"Girls Town.\") What Jules and Ophelia offer is a more literal version of the terrible sisterhood so often forged among campus victims, who furtively scrawl their attackers' names on bathroom walls as a warning to other women, but who may never meet or talk to those women. \n\nThe two are the quirky-white-girl version of an odd couple: Scholarship student Jules scrambles to fit class and sorority events into her ass-kicking schedule while Ophelia deals weed from her record-store job and sleeps until 3pm. Their first moment of solidarity is slapstick \u2014 they belt out Wicked's \"Defying Gravity\" while a dead rapist decomposes in the trunk of Ophelia's car \u2014 but pointed: These are not superheroines, they're flawed young women navigating a brutal, entrenched system of expectations and assumptions perpetuated by men and women alike. \n\nAs vigilante fantasy, \"Sweet/Vicious\" can be deeply satisfying, and with subplots that tackle racial profiling and Greek-system hazing, the show stands to complicate the straightforward good girl/evil guy binary. But if viewers are unsettled or disturbed by the prospect of young women forcing sexual predators to reckon with the often casual, unthinking privilege with which they approach their victims (it's notable that in the opening scene, Jules's frat-boy prey blurts out that he \"didn't meant to hurt anybody\"), perhaps they should be. \n\nPop culture, media, and real life have for decades told too many women that the harm perpetrated on them doesn't \"count,\" doesn't matter. After eight years with a President who addressed sexual violence straight-on, American women are now faced with a President who brags about \"getting away\" with it. In a time when threats to rights, liberties, and bodily autonomy have quickly escalated, don't be surprised when women don't sit quietly and hope for the best.

It also gives priority status to refugees \"provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\"\n\nSome Jewish groups were particularly troubled by the implications for Muslim refugees.\n\n\"The fact that President Trump's order appears designed to specifically limit the entry of Muslims evokes horrible memories\" of Jews turned away during World War II, the progressive Jewish organization J Street said in a statement ahead of the executive action taking affect. \"Most ultimately perished in the Holocaust.

In addition, five members of the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army were killed and at least 22 others injured.\n\nAn army statement said that the coalition air force had conducted five airstrikes in northern Syria over the past 24 hours, killing eight ISIS militants.\n\nMeanwhile, ISIS claimed responsibility late Friday for a car bombing that killed nine people in Diyarbakir, Turkey, according to a statement circulated online by the ISIS-affiliated Amaq Agency.\n\nThe claim contradicted an earlier statement in which Turkish authorities blamed the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, for the blast. The attack on a police station in Diyarbakir injured at least 100 people.

Since October, a coalition of Iraqi-led forces including the Iraqi army, counter-terrorism forces, federal police, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shiite-led paramilitaries have pushed to end ISIS' brutal rule in Mosul. \n\nThe city remains the last major Iraqi stronghold of ISIS after the militant group seized control in 2014. \n\nThe operation to liberate Mosul is taking longer than expected and the suffering of civilians there is only increasing.\n\nHow significant are the recent advances in Mosul? \n\nThey are very significant. Toward the end of November, it seemed that the Iraqi Special Forces were getting bogged down in eastern Mosul, hit by countless suicide bombs as well as mortar fire from areas where civilians were present. There was a deliberate pause toward the end of December to reassess.\n\nMore forces, including the Iraqi Federal Police, were brought to the eastern side. The relaunch of the campaign has featured rapid assaults to punch through ISIS resistance in neighborhoods on the right bank of the Tigris. By January 8, Iraqi forces had reached at least one stretch of the river bank and now control about two-thirds of eastern Mosul.\n\n\"In the second phase of Mosul operations, we have used new methods in fighting ISIS militants,\" Lt. Gen. Abdul Wahab al-Saadi, commander of the liberation of the city, told CNN on Wednesday. \n\n\"The most effective method was the night raids conducted by Iraqi troops against ISIS headquarters and positions in eastern Mosul.\"\n\nIt may be that ISIS calculated there was little to be gained by further fierce resistance in the east, given that the bridges across the Tigris were unusable. \n\nThere is also the possibility that it's running out of suicide bombers; several of those recently eulogized were teenagers. But there may be weeks of fighting before ISIS relinquishes its foothold in eastern Mosul. There are still tens of thousands of civilians there, which makes offensive operations much harder. \n\nAre there a lot of territories left under ISIS control? \n\nAll of western Mosul as well as pockets of resistance in the city's environs. Western Mosul, according to satellite imagery and the accounts of former residents, is going to be a much tougher proposition. \n\nThe older part of the city has warrens of alleys that are impassable to military vehicles. ISIS has dedicated much of its defensive preparations to this area; Iraqi Security Forces will not be able to attack across the river because all five bridges are heavily damaged, so the offensive will have to come from the south and west.\n\nAccording to the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War, the army \"will likely pause before an operation launches to cross the river in order to regroup and plan for the likely stiff ISIS resistance on the western bank.\"\n\nEven when Mosul is finally cleared -- and that could take until the spring -- ISIS is likely to be able to continue to launch suicide attacks in much of Iraq, including Baghdad. \n\nThere are signs that ISIS are regenerating an underground presence in places where it has lost territorial control, such as Diyala. And it still controls some towns in the west of Iraq. But the loss of Mosul would essentially leave the so-called Caliphate a string of towns under pressure -- from Raqqa in Syria westward.\n\nWhy is it taking so long for the army and allied groups to recapture Mosul? \n\nUrban warfare, especially in the midst of hundreds of thousands of civilians, is the most difficult there is. Tikrit, Ramadi, Fallujah were all tough, and they are much smaller than Mosul. The forces tasked with retaking Mosul have largely been the spearhead in a two-year war of attrition against ISIS.\n\nThey have suffered losses of experienced combat troops and equipment. Many of the units involved have little sense of Mosul's geography. They have learned on the job. And in Mosul, they don't have the direct assistance of the Shia-dominated paramilitary units that were an important factor elsewhere.\n\nAre the US-led airstrikes helping? \n\nYes. As intelligence and co-ordination have improved, so has targeting. Since the offensive against Mosul proper began early in November, there have been hundreds of coalition airstrikes against ISIS positions.\n\nAl-Saadi told CNN that the Iraqi Air Force and US-led coalition have increased airstrikes on ISIS-held areas of eastern Mosul.\n\n\"Many ISIS militants were killed, several ISIS headquarters were destroyed, and ISIS leadership in eastern Mosul has started to collapse,\" al-Saadi said from inside Mosul. \n\nOn Monday alone, according to the coalition, airpower engaged four ISIS tactical units; destroyed seven ISIS-held buildings, four vehicle suicide bombs and a factory that makes them, and damaged 18 ISIS supply routes. That's a typical day. But the terrorists' use of tunnels and mobile mortars, their ability to hide among civilians in abandoned properties, has made the use of airpower more challenging.\n\nIt is a slow, grinding process but as Colonel John Dorrian, the coalition spokesman, puts it: \"Every day the Iraqi Security Forces go forward and every day the enemy goes backward or underground.\" The latest offensive has been helped by the presence of some 450 US and coalition personnel within the city limits, offering advice and support. \n\nWhat about the civilians living in both parts of Mosul? \n\nThe latest UN data is that 135,000 people have been displaced by the battle for Mosul. Many more have decided to take shelter in place, not least because ISIS frequently fires on civilians who try to leave. UN agencies note that, in one week alone, nearly 700 people in the east were taken to hospital with trauma injuries.\n\nThose who stayed have had intermittent power and water at best, and dwindling stocks of food. As soon as their neighborhoods are liberated, large lines form for food aid and basic medical treatment. The United Nations and NGOs would much rather people stay in their homes because camps are already near to capacity. \n\nOn Wednesday, Lt. Gen. Raed Shakir Jawdat, commander of the federal police force, announced that ISIS militants were forcing people to leave their homes, herding them behind enemy lines and using them as human shields to stymie advancing Iraqi troops. \n\nMORE: Out of Mosul, into limbo -- the refugees fleeing ISIS\n\nBack in October, Lise Grande, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, said that if more than 150,000 people were forced to flee Mosul \"there isn't an institution in the world that could cope with that scale of movement.\"\n\nThe most hopeful sign is that markets and more organized relief efforts are beginning to bring a semblance of normality to recently liberated districts. Last week alone, 50,000 people received food and hygiene-related aid, according to a UN report on humanitarian response.\n\nThe situation in western Mosul is much worse, with shortages of basic goods amid siege-like conditions. \"Bakeries are not functioning in many areas and residents are not allowed to use generators, even if they have fuel to power them,\" says the latest UN assessment. And for the people there, the prospect of liberation is likely months away.

Both sides have reason to claim at least a partial victory in the final resolution of this class action litigation drama. \n\nThe suits asserted fraud claims on behalf of approximately 6,000 former students who had enrolled in the President-elect's seminar and what many would label a faux on-line \"university.\" \n\nIn a defensive tweet, Mr. Trump suggested that he quite reluctantly ordered the suits settled only because of the potential that they would interfere with his presidential responsibilities. His incoming chief of staff, RNC chair Reince Priebus, reinforced this claim. \n\nTrump also repeated a prior assertion that the suits lacked merit and that he would have preferred to litigate and win:\n\n\"The only BAD thing about winning the presidency\" is he doesn't have time to sit for a trial he says he would have won, he tweeted. \"Too bad!\"\n\nTrump also said the $25 million settlement was much less than his potential financial exposure in the cases, which alleged Trump defrauded people who enrolled in real estate seminars he started in 2005.\n\n\"I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.\"\n\nIn fact, the settlement looks to be a good deal for the students. Most will recover at least 50% of the tuition they paid for taking the Trump courses. The plaintiffs get some significant compensation that publicly affirms the common-sense validity of their accusations of fraud. Try to picture legitimate universities like Trump's alma maters Fordham and Penn issuing 50% tuition refunds to students in response to class action lawsuits alleging fraud. \n\n Mr. Trump, though, also had sound reasons to act. Class actions almost always settle if they have been \"certified\" by the court as non-frivolous matters. The students might even have won at trial if supported by credible evidence. The Trump University matters were not only \"certified\" but had also survived motions to dismiss. All of this means that these cases were destined to go to trial if not resolved out of court. \n\nThe vast majority of \"certified\" class actions settle with good reason. Legal defense costs are exorbitant and if the defendants lose the case, the verdict can be catastrophically high.\n\nLet's say the jurors agree to the kind of number customarily awarded for only a minor injury, say $25,000 as restitution for the tuition and a \"punitive damage\" award to \"send a message\" that reprehensible conduct of this sort will not be tolerated. Multiply $25,000 times 6,000 students and the figure award adds up to $150 million. But wait...those expensive Trump defense lawyers at O'Melveny and Meyers including Dan Petrocelli (the victims' lead counsel on the OJ Simpson civil case) and other defense lawyers and experts have to be paid for their work on the cases in New York and California. Let's throw in at least $5 million for them, bringing the total award to at least $155 million. Would the number get reduced on appeal? Probably, but that process would be a long, costly and embarrassing effort -- all taking place in the middle of the Trump presidency. \n\nAlthough both sides made sensible decisions in settling before trial, Mr. Trump will still have to worry that potential litigants will be emboldened by these settlements to pursue cases of their own against the new Commander-in-Chief. There are by all accounts several dozens of lawsuits pending against Mr. Trump and his businesses, with more in the wings. \n\nIronically, the Supreme Court has previously ruled in the case of William Jefferson Clinton vs Paula Jones (the latter being one of Mr. Trump's invited guests at one of the presidential debates) that even the president of the United States has to appear in civil cases regarding matters that occurred prior to his election. It really wouldn't take much of the president's time, opined the unanimous court.  The justices obviously never considered a Trump presidency, ruling that the matter of a president having to appear in court had only come up three times in American history. These were single, inconsequential matters involving Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy.  \n\nCompared with his less litigious predecessors, then, Mr. Trump faces, even if only considering a conservative estimate of potential suits, an historic number of legal matters that will hover over him like a dark cloud on Inauguration Day. Unless the Supreme Court carves out a new rule deferring personal lawsuits against the president until his term is complete, President Trump will be coughing up substantial coin to make these lawsuits go away so he can get around to building that wall.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.82387018203735, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 796, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.9681504940599996, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161121200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 7, "pct_mft_words": 2.63819095477387, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/gil-kerlikowske-donald-trump-travel-ban/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Former border chief: 'I don't believe anyone was talked to about a travel ban'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 549, "date": "20170130180000", "story_content": "The recently retired Customs and Border Protection Chief, Gil Kerlikowske, said Monday the White House claim that it had been working with the Department of Homeland Security on the executive order for weeks is simply untrue. \n\n\"I don't believe anyone was talked to about a travel ban for weeks,\" said Kerlikowske, who retired January 20.\n\nHe said that no one from the transition team ever contacted him and there were only two short meetings with members of his staff and the transition team where the contemplation of a travel ban was never brought up. \n\n\"There was never a conversation with the transition team, which seems odd given the fact this isn't a cabinet level position -- this is an operational office.\" \n\nCNN has reached out to the White House for comment and have not yet gotten a response. \n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday barring travelers from seven majority Muslim countries from entering the US, delaying acceptance of refugees for at least 120 days and banning Syrian refugees indefinitely.

The US only recently made small inroads into the Indian defense markets and historical skepticism within India at the prospect of more robust relations with America persists.\n\nBut en route to New Delhi, Carter told reporters, \"India and the United States are destined to be strategic partners.\"\n\nThe relationship has \"grown by leaps and bounds\" since 2008, Carter said, adding that he intended to discuss with his counterpart a \"major change\" that is \"very close to the finish line\" regarding the easing of regulations on defense exports to India.\n\n\"It permits us to do things with India that have never been possible before\" by creating a \"presumption of approval for transactions with India,\" he added.\n\nRELATED: Is the Indian defense minister Ash Carter's new BFF?\n\nCarter and his Indian counterpart,\u00a0Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar,\u00a0were due to hold\u00a0their seventh meeting\u00a0Thursday, and Carter has previously said he has spent more time with him than \"any other defense counterpart anywhere in the world.\"\n\nThe two men are said to have a lot in common, both rising to their respective nation's top defense posts while possessing backgrounds\u00a0in science and engineering.\n\n\"They have a very strong personal relationship,\"\u00a0a senior defense official told CNN, crediting Carter with being the leading force behind Obama's effort to bolster US-India ties.\n\n\"Ash Carter is the champion of this relationship in the administration,\" the official said.\n\nBut some observers of US-India relations\u00a0noted\u00a0that the improved bilateral defense relationship predates both Carter and Obama.\n\n\"I think the US- India defense relationship has blossomed over the years irrespective of Obama's 'pivot/rebalance to Asia' policy,\" Bharath Gopalaswamy, director of the South Asia Center at the Washington-based Atlantic Council, told CNN.\n\nHe said that \"the security relationship between the two countries have slowly remained on the upward trajectory\" ever since the US and India signed an accord governing civil nuclear issues during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nIn recent months,\u00a0the US and India have signed\u00a0several\u00a0more\u00a0accords, including\u00a0a logistics exchange memorandum of agreement that will allow the US and Indian navies to receive logistical support at each other's installations.\n\nCarter has also trumpeted increased joint military exercises between the two nations and has highlighted how the\u00a0Asian pivot has\u00a0coincided with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's \"Act East Policy,\"\u00a0a diplomatic initiative aimed at boosting India's presence and relationships in East and Southeast Asia.\u00a0\n\nCarter said Wednesday that he was encouraging India to increase the pace of joint military exercises both with the US and American allies.\n\nSome analysts in Washington and New Delhi see the two large democracies as natural allies, particularly given China's increasingly assertive actions in the region,\u00a0such as\u00a0the construction of islands equipped with military-capable runways.\n\n\"As the world's two largest democracies, we are uniquely poised to help bring greater security and prosperity to the entire region,\" Adm.

During the Cold War, India avoided any such cooperation as part of its membership in the\u00a0movement of\u00a0non-aligned\u00a0countries.\n\nBut that has been changing in recent years, especially once Modi was elected in 2014. During his visit to Washington in June, the US\u00a0designated\u00a0India a \"major defense partner.\"\n\nBut Parrikar himself has acknowledged the challenges involved in boosting the two countries' military cooperation, noting that mistrust and skepticism among the Indian public had challenged even the signing of the logistics agreement, with people falsely believing that it would lead to US bases in India.\n\nIndia's complicated history with the US is also reflected in its purchase or arms. While the US government and American defense firms would welcome the chance to sell more weapons and equipment to India, for decades New Delhi has traditionally\u00a0bought\u00a0its\u00a0arms\u00a0from Russia and before that the Soviet Union.\n\n\"We come from a history of separateness,\" Carter acknowledged.\n\nRELATED: Carter looks to shore-up US-Japan military alliance\n\nIndia is the world's biggest importer of arms, receiving 14% of all global deliveries from 2011-2015, according to statistics compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI.\n\nIts biggest supplier is Russia, which provided 70% of those arms transfers, while the US lags behind in second place,\u00a0responsible for\u00a0only 14% of Indian imports. And in 2012,\u00a0the US\u00a0lost out on a major competition for India's fighter jet to the French.\n\nBut the US has also enjoyed some successes under the Obama administration, with the Indian military opting to purchase C-130J transport planes from US-based Lockheed Martin -- a deal the company described as representing \"the first major military contract between the US and India in more than 40 years.\"\n\nLast week,\u00a0the Indian government signed a long-awaited contract on artillery pieces with\u00a0BAE Systems North America valued at close to $750 million.\n\n\"We've made significant progress on the defense side with India,\" the defense official said. US arms exports to India were 11 times higher in 2010-2015 than 2006-2010, according to SIPRI.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFurther complicating the burgeoning US-India relationship was Trump's recent call with the leader of India's long-time adversary, Pakistan\u00a0President Nawaz Sharif.\n\nA transcript of that call issued by the Pakistani\u00a0Foreign\u00a0Ministry depicted Trump\u00a0complimenting\u00a0Sharif.\n\n\"I think the Indian administration, like many other administrations, share a sense of nervousness about the Trump administration,\" Gopalaswamy\u00a0of the\u00a0Atlantic Council said.\n\nBut\u00a0Gopalaswamy was skeptical that the call with the Pakistani premier would have a demonstrable effect, saying, \"Concerns about the transcript posing any challenges to US-India defense relationship are overstated.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.38880249857902505, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1117, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.05865524387, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.05908683974933, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/donald-trump-diplomacy/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00c9": [3191], "\u00e9": [3195]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1022, "scraper_regex": 1074}}, "headline": "Trump's roller coaster first week of diplomacy", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1074, "date": "20170130030000", "story_content": "As President Donald Trump concluded lunch with his British counterpart Friday, he appeared so enthralled at successfully executing his first bout of face-to-face diplomacy that he asked an aide to file away the menu card for safekeeping.\n\n\"Keep that safe,\" he said, according to a UK official. \"I had lunch with the British prime minister.\"\n\nIndeed, after a meal of braised beef and his favorite iceberg wedge salad, Trump had reason to believe his debut as a statesman was a singular success. \n\nResistance to Trump's travel ban mounts\n\nDuring an 18-minute news conference, he stuck rigidly to script touting the transatlantic special relationship, never veering into the conspiratorial areas that had distracted him the week prior. UK Prime Minister Theresa May, meanwhile, hailed him as a populist savior and announced the British Queen had invited him to London.\n\nTwo days and seven phone calls later, the glow of Trump's diplomatic coming-out has faded. \n\nAs he convened call after call to foreign capitals this weekend, it became clear his travel ban on certain Muslim-majority nations would create rifts with some of the United States' closest partners -- including with May herself -- and threaten to isolate Trump, the newest member of the global leaders' club.\n\nSitting stone-faced at his paper-strewn Resolute Desk Saturday, Trump sipped from a glass of Diet Coke as the businesslike German chancellor Angela Merkel explained US obligations under the Geneva Convention. The agreement requires the US to accept refugees from war-torn nations, Merkel made clear in her notoriously restrained manner.\n\n\"The German Chancellor explained that policy to the US President,\" said her spokesman Steffen Seibert. \"She is convinced that the necessary, decisive battle against terrorism does not justify a general suspicion against people of a certain origin or a certain religion.\"\n\nAlready skeptical of Merkel for her close ties to his predecessor, President Barack Obama, Trump as recently as two weeks ago was chastising the German leader for her \"very catastrophic mistake ... taking all of these illegals.\" \n\nTrump set to make his Supreme Court pick as part of a frenetic Week 2\n\nA person familiar with his reaction said the President chafed at Merkel's lecture.\n\nShe was only the first in a string of leaders who raised the refugee issue to Trump this weekend. Officials at the White House had booked a full slate of calls, capitalizing on Trump's desire to work long hours and unwillingness to break from his new role. Even when his conversations were meant to occur in the privacy of his own residence, Trump nevertheless dressed in a suit and tie to place the calls from the Oval Office.\n\nBut as he began dialing world leaders on Saturday, it became evident that his explosive directive to deny entry to refugees for 120 days, while also banning US travel for all citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, would cause problems with his allies.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande told Trump that in \"an unstable and uncertain world, withdrawal into oneself is a dead-end response,\" according to a statement from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. \n\nHollande, who speaks limited English, told Trump through a translator that democracies could only be defended \"if we respect the principles that founded them, especially with the welcoming of refugees.\"\n\nAustralia's Malcolm Turnbull used his phone call to ensure a refugee resettlement agreement signed last year would still be honored. Obama had encouraged Turnbull, a conservative, to develop close ties to Trump in a bid to stabilize the brash new leader.\n\nAnd May, less than 48 hours after she left the White House, was forced to denounce Trump's policy after British journalists harangued her during a news conference in the Turkish capital Ankara.\n\n\"We do not agree with this kind of approach and it is not one we will be taking,\" a spokesman for May said after her performance at the Turkey news conference was derided. A Downing Street spokesman said May had instructed her foreign and home secretaries to speak with their US counterparts to \"protect the rights of British nationals.\"\n\nTrump is operating without a secretary of state, however, as his nominee Rex Tillerson awaits confirmation by the US Senate. On Saturday he was also operating without his chief liaison to foreign governments, senior adviser Jared Kushner, whose Orthodox Jewish observation of the Sabbath prevents work or the use of technology. \n\nKushner has assumed an outsized role in the West Wing, principally on foreign affairs, making his absence Saturday notable. Trump, who is also Kushner's father-in-law, has tasked him with managing relations with Mexico amid a dispute over the proposed border wall. He's also regarded by Trump allies in Washington as less ideological than other top advisers, like former Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon or conservative policy stalwart Steven Miller.\n\nKushner was back in the Oval Office on Sunday as Trump faced a new round of phone calls, plus the news that an American commando had died in a shootout with al Qaeda militants in Yemen. The incident came during the first counterterrorism operation authorized by the new President. Trump, who signed off on the raid last week, nonetheless declared the mission successful in a statement, indicating the US had gathering valuable intelligence, despite the casualty. \n\n\"Americans are saddened this morning with news that a life of a heroic service member has been taken in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism. My deepest thoughts and humblest prayers are with the family of this fallen service member,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nShortly after learning the news, Trump spoke with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, whose military has been battling Houthi militants in Yemen. A Saudi source said the refugee ban was expected to arise on the call.\n\nTrump also spoke with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, whose two flagship airlines have faced conflicting guidance in the wake of Trump's order.   \n\nInstead of a cluttered nest of papers, Trump's desk on Sunday was neater. After a day of facing withering criticism, both on the phone and in the streets, only a single copy of the New York Post's Inauguration issue lay in front of him, the front page featuring a photo of his swearing-in and the quote \"Power to You, the People\" from his address.\n\nA few hours after his calls, Trump issued a defiant statement in support of his executive order.\n\n\"This is not about religion,\" he wrote. \"This is about terror and keeping our country safe.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.66299366950989, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1022, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.86764497931, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170130030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.91389432485323, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/donald-trump-outreach/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "So far 'presidential' Trump no more a uniter than candidate Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1159, "date": "20161205120000", "story_content": "Donald Trump vowed on election night to \"bind the wounds of division\" but so far he's not doing much to become a president for all Americans.\n\nBut from his point of view, why should he?\n\nTrump and his transition team are basking in vindication after winning a famous election victory that the pundits and the political establishment told him for months would be impossible. His Cabinet nominees and senior advisers have skewed to the right, some causing controversy of their own. His \"thank you\" tour which began in Ohio this week and will make more stops in Iowa and North Carolina in the coming days, focuses in states he won.  And with a Republican Congress, Trump doesn't necessarily need a lot of Democrats and other opponents to govern.\n\nYet while Trump has reached out to previous critics like Mitt Romney as part of meetings with a parade of cabinet hopefuls and other would-be influencers -- and found time to launch a Twitter war with China -- his outreach hasn't extended to the 65 million Americans who voted for someone else.\n\nBut Trump never makes the conventional political move, and is hardly known for magnanimity in victory. For now, he seems more concerned with pointing out the size of his victory than reaching out to those who have expressed deep anxiety about it. His 306 electoral votes smashed the Democratic belief that the demographics of the political map meant the GOP would struggle to win presidential elections.\n\n\"Folks, how many times did we hear this? There is no path to 270\" Trump asked on the first stop of his victory tour, a raucous rally in Cincinnati on Thursday. His speech was also packed with swipes at the \"dishonest\" media, his Republican rivals and boasts about the size of his win over Clinton.\n\nTrump's lieutenants are in no mood for olive branches either.\n\nVice President-elect Mike Pence said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that Trump won a \"historic mandate election.\" And Trump aide Kellyanne Conway couldn't resist pointing out to angry Clinton campaign aides at a forum at Harvard University last week that it was too late to complain about the manner and tone of Trump's campaign.\n\n\"Hashtag, he's your President,\" Conway said at an event that proved that no one involved in the election is ready to bind the wounds of division just yet.\n\nHis strategy of gloating and triumphalism, however it might delight his supporters, does raise the question of whether his approach is storing up future political problems.\n\nOnly when he is president and faces a national crisis, or an economic slowdown or some other unexpected political reverse will it become clear whether relying on a comparatively narrow base of support is a liability for Trump.\n\nProtests erupted in some cities with demonstrators holding signs stating that Trump would never be their president. At the Harvard event last week, former Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri told Conway she had presided over a campaign that gave a platform to white nationalists, a notion Conway rejected.\n\nThe idea that Trump has a responsibility to ease such divides was laid out by Khizr Khan, a Hillary Clinton supporter and father of a US Muslim soldier killed in Iraq, who slammed Trump in a speech at the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"He has been elected president but he has to earn our respect,\" Khan told CNN's Anderson Cooper last month. \"He has to earn the position of the presidency. We appeal to the surrogates of Donald Trump and to him himself that he needs to take the first step.\"\n\nFor now, the priority is renewing the President-elect's bond with the fiercely loyal band of heartland supporters to whom he spoke like no other recent presidential candidate in the campaign.\n\nThat's why the deal he clinched to keep 1,000 jobs at the Carrier air conditioner plant in Indiana announced last week was such a political win for Trump.\n\nIt might have triggered cries of government meddling to save an uncompetitive plant from the likes of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page and complaints that it was a drop in the bucket and was impractical on a national scale from Democrats.\n\nBut the gesture cemented Trump in the eyes of his supporters as someone who would live up to his promise to get his hands dirty to fight for the American worker -- even if it meant breaking the rules of how things work in Washington.\n\nTrump's willingness to risk a rebuke from China by taking a call from the leader of nationalist Taiwan on Friday horrified the Washington foreign policy establishment because it threw 40 years of diplomatic precedent out of the window.\n\nBut again, it was a case of Trump doing what he pledged his supporters he would do -- shake up conventions and business as usual.\n\nAnother controversy during Trump's transition centered on his tweet calling for people who burn the American flag to be put in jail or stripped of their citizenship. The media and Trump's political foes reacted by pointing out that such a move would infringe constitutional rights to free speech.\n\n\"The President-elect is someone who has pushed the envelope and caused people to think in this country, has not taken conventional thought on every single issue,\" Trump's incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on CBS \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nTrump's twitter tirades to his nearly 17 million followers are a direct line to his supporters. On Sunday, he went on a tweet storm about his plans to stop US firms from taking jobs and factories abroad, threatening them with a 35% tariff on goods they want to sell back across the border.\n\nTrump's most loyal supporters stand as a warning to more conventional Republican conservatives and lawmakers that he has his own passionate power base, ahead of likely policy clashes over issues like Medicare or taxes in years to come.\n\nAs he moves towards the White House, Trump may begin paying more lip service to unity. He is apparently considering some Democrats from conservative states for a cabinet post and met North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp last week. There's also speculation about West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. For his part, Pence has met Democratic House minority leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nAnd even Trump, the most unconventional President-elect ever, is unlikely to turn the inaugural address into a raging, grievance-fueled campaign rally. \n\nIn Ohio at times he appeared to be trying out soaring lines that might be appropriate for such a national moment -- albeit after the crowd shouted \"Lock her up\" when Trump mentioned Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"We're going to seek a truly inclusive society where we support each other, love each other and look out for each other,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We condemn bigotry and prejudice in all of its forms. We denounce all of the hatred and we forcefully reject the language of exclusion and separation,\" he said.\n\n\"We're going to come together,\" he added. \"We have no choice.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.76322412490845, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1110, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.86122919665, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205120000, "FairnessVice": 4, "pct_mft_words": 2.97297297297297, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/11/arts/amman-ink-jordan-tattoo/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3883, 3992, 4392]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 825, "scraper_regex": 895}}, "headline": "The forbidden art that's booming in Jordan", "wordcount_as_scraped": 895, "date": "20161212020000", "story_content": "One of 20-year-old Texana Mubaidin's defining features is her elaborate tattoo. \n\nThe hand-drawn goat, which symbolizes her zodiac sign, the Capricorn, stretches up her arm and across her shoulder, and accompanies her three other tattoos.\n\nIt's a bold statement, which a couple of decades ago would have been unthinkable. \n\nBut attitudes towards body art in the Middle East are changing, as illustrated by a new photo-documentary project by Jordanian photographer Bashar Alaeddin. \n\nHis series, Arab Ink, charts the relationship between Arabic calligraphy and tattoo art, and the role the latter plays in self-expression.\n\nAlaeddin's project, which started in 2014, often features the work of the tattoo artists at Huzz Ink.\n\nThe tattoo parlor, where American-Jordanian Mubaidin is assistant manager, is part of this a wave of tattoo parlors in the region. \n\n\"In the Middle East and Jordan, tattoos have been considered taboo, or haram (forbidden or proscribed by Islamic law),\" says Saif Hourani, manager of Huzz Ink.  \n\n\"Now we see a lot of people -- like way more people -- getting tattoos, especially young people. They are Jordanian, Arabs. \n\n\"Sometimes people come from Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Libya.\"\n\nA lasting impression\n\nHuzz Ink's headquarters in the Jordanian capital of Amman feels like the home of a perfectionist -- meticulously clean and clinically organized. \n\nLeather couches, an eclectic contemporary art collection, and a wall of carefully arranged photographs of inspirational tattoos lend the place some character.\n\nOwner and artist Hazim Naouri, who has four tattoos, studied for an international tattoo certification in the United States before returning to Jordan to open what he says was the country's first tattoo parlor in 2007. \n\nNaouri's father, who had a small tattoo himself, taught his son how to use a needle and ink when he was just 13 years old.\n\nNow aged 30, the artist has opened Huzz Ink and expanded across the Middle East.\n\nNaouri says the business \"promotes itself\" through word of mouth, and on social media platform such as Facebook and Instagram, where he posts videos and pictures of new creations each month.\n\n\"I consider myself the ambassador of ink in the Arab world,\" says Naouri. \"I would have loved for (my dad) to see that his child did this.\"\n\nInk in the Middle East\n\nThe Middle East has a long tradition of human body art. The practice was popular in Egypt and Persia (modern-day Iran) in ancient times, and nomadic Bedouin tribal clans and Orthodox Coptic Christians today still embrace the tradition. \n\nBut the practice is uncommon in mainstream society in the Middle East due to the rise of Islam and accompanying religious doctrines.\n\n\"Usually, when they see anybody who has a tattoo, guy or female, (people in Jordan) would think that he's part of a gang or just a dangerous person,\" Mubaidin tells CNN.\n\nIn Jordan, as in much of the Middle East, tattoo parlors are forbidden under Shariah religious law -- or the code that governs members of the Islamic faith. \n\n\"Religious views in general, (in) Islam or Christianity ... (among the) Jews. Everybody is against tattoos,\" says Naouri. \"Why? Because you have to respect your body and you don't have to modify it to be respectable to the community.\"\n\nWhile there are no legal consequences, conservative Islamic groups believe that tattoos scar the flesh and are therefore an insult to Allah, the Arabic word for god.\n\n\"(In Jordan), it's not fully legal, it's not fully illegal. But there are so many people doing it,\" explains Naouri. \n\nSpreading the word\n\nAs the the first Jordanian tattoo parlor entrepreneur, Naouri feels a responsibility to push attitudes forward in the region.\n\n\"The Arab world had not taken any part in any international tattoo business or piercing (conferences),\" he says. \"I've been the first one to do that.\u00a0 \n\n\"And so Huzz Ink is not just a parlor or a shop. We're not just tattooing people, we're giving knowledge.\u00a0We're promoting art.\"\n\nThat promotion is a two-way street: as well as educating his countrymen about body art, he has invited international tattoo artist to visit his outlets, and at conventions \"in Vegas, in China, in Thailand\" -- where little is known about the Middle East's body art scene -- Naouri has become a spokesperson for the nascent tattoo scene at home.\n\n\"They are astonished,\" he says.\u00a0\n\nThe ultimate self expression\n\nWhile there's a growing acceptance of cosmetic tattoos in the Middle East -- such as eyebrow tattoos -- Naouri says his mission is deeper.\n\n\"My goal is to give the chance to people to express themselves on their skin.\"\n\n\"Every single day there's an interesting story,\" he says. \"People come to me, approach me about something very personal.\"\n\nThe majority of customers are looking for something featuring Arabic calligraphy or art, and deep, personal meaning, such as the name of a family member or a poignant word. \n\nReem Al Fattal, a customer at Huzz Ink, sought out Naouri's help to immortalize her father, who was murdered when she was a teenager.\n\n\"I have the word 'abi' on me forever as a tattoo,\" says Al Fattal. \"It literally means 'daddy.' So I can have my dad around me or with me all the time.\"\n\nNaouri says he serves as many female customers as he does male.\n\nFrom a family of artists, musicians and craftsman, Naouri says working with his hands comes naturally.\n\n\"It's like a painting,\" he says. \"At the end of the day, needles are like brushes.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.6198704242706299, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 825, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.0096264285900003, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161212020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.42424242424242, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/africa/congo-un-visit-unrest/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 558, "scraper_regex": 608}}, "headline": "Congo: UN delegates visit amid political turmoil", "wordcount_as_scraped": 608, "date": "20161111170000", "story_content": "Members of the UN Security Council are slated to visit the Democratic Republic of Congo on Friday amid mounting international concern about increased violence and political unrest in the troubled Central African nation.\n\nPresident Joseph Kabila's two terms in office are due to end December 19.

But reports that the militant group has brought thousands of civilians -- mostly women and children -- into Mosul as human shields raises serious concerns that there could be a high number of civilian casualties in the battle.\n\nThe Special Adviser of the UN Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, said that he condemned \"in the strongest terms\" the \"continued, absolute disregard for international human rights and international humanitarian law\" by the terror group. \n\nCiting the abduction and execution by ISIS of large numbers of civilians, and the use of human shields in and around Mosul, he stressed in a statement that the perpetrators of ISIS' war crimes need to be held accountable and said that existing allegations of these crimes are sufficient to be acted upon immediately.\n\nHe added that the Iraqi government has an obligation to stamp out retaliatory violence by Iraqi troops or associated militias. \n\n\"Any kind of retaliatory violence against individuals on the basis of their membership of a specific group is unacceptable and will undermine the legitimate calls of these communities for their own protection and for their long-standing grievances to be addressed.\" \n\nMeanwhile, Turkey moved tanks and bulldozers from Ankara to southeastern cities near the Iraqi border, its closest position to Mosul, according to a statement from the Turkish military. \n\nTurkey's defense minister said they were being used to fight against terror, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nLife in a post-ISIS town: Shaving, haircuts and cigarettes\n\nIn striking distance\n\nIraqi forces surrounded the ISIS-held village of Gogjali on Mosul's eastern outskirts Tuesday and by late afternoon had taken control of the village, Maj. Gen. Maan al-Saadi, commander of Iraqi counter-terrorism special forces, told CNN. A commander on the ground said troops are working to clear any explosives ISIS may have left behind in Gogjali.\n\nThe village is the last populated area before eastern Mosul and freeing Gogjali opens the path for forces to enter the larger city. \n\n#Iraq-i counter-Terrorism special forces are on the move to capture #Gogjali village, 900 meters east of #Mosul. pic.twitter.com/EUniKRJbl6\u2014 Hamdi (@HamdiAlkhshali) November 1, 2016\n\nIraqi troops took control of a state TV building on the eastern edge of Mosul and raised the Iraqi flag over it, according to a statement released by Iraq's joint military commands.\n\nInside ISIS-held Mosul: Secret film shows desolate scene\n\nAn officer with the country's Counter-Terrorism Force told CNN that progress had been slowed by the large number of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and mines planted by ISIS. He was speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk with the media.\n\nProgress was also slowed by the presence of as many as 20,000 civilians who are still in Gogjali, who are essentially being used as human shields by ISIS, according to Saadi.\n\nOther officers told CNN that ISIS fighters had blocked the main road between the village and Mosul with boulders and that bulldozers were needed to clear them. The road is also laced with IEDs and mines, they said. \n\nCNN correspondents near Gogjali said earlier Tuesday that they could see smoke rising on Mosul's perimeter from oil trenches being set on fire to obscure warplanes from striking ISIS targets and deter troops from entering. \n\nTroops are now in clear striking distance of the city and they appear to have begun an assault on Mosul from outside. \n\nPrime Minister to ISIS: 'Surrender or die'\n\nOn Monday night, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi gave the estimated 5,000 ISIS militants holed up in Mosul a chilling warning as troops approached the city's doorstep.\n\n\"There is no way to escape, either surrender or die,\" he told a reporter for state-run Iraqiya TV at the Qayyara airbase south of Mosul. \n\nWe will \"cut the head (off) the snake,\" he said.   \n\nAbadi urged Mosul's beleaguered residents, who have suffered under ISIS rule since June 2014, to stay indoors during the battle. He also said they should resist ISIS-propogated rumors and do what they can to prevent ISIS from destroying the city's infrastructure. \n\nHe also noted that for the first time, Iraqi forces would be fighting side by side with Kurdish Peshmerga troops and urged politicians to \"leave (their) political differences aside.\"\n\nThe coalition of around 100,000 people in the Mosul offensive is an extraordinary union of ethnic and religious groups that have long stood on opposing sides in Iraq's history.\n\nAmong them are Kurdish groups, including the Peshmerga, and Shia and Christian paramilitary groups.\n\nThe battle for Mosul is seen as one of the most significant in the fight against ISIS.

The author works for the podcast.\n\nDonald Trump's continued war of words with our nation's intelligence community presents a stark and troubling departure from the traditional role of the President of the United States, suggests Fox News's Chris Wallace.\n\n\"One of the things I've been talking about [is] how Trump, in his tweets, talks about the intelligence community and puts intelligence in quotes. You can't have that,\" Wallace told David Axelrod on \"The Axe Files,\" a podcast from the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.\n\nWallace, host of the Sunday news program \"Fox News Sunday,\" spoke with Axelrod last week on the day the nation's intelligence chiefs briefed the President-elect on the report that tied Russia to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Wallace expressed his dismay over Trump's public campaign to malign the integrity of the intelligence community.\n\n\"You can't have the president denigrating the 17 [intelligence] agencies of patriots who risk their lives in many cases to try to give them the best information to make decisions,\" Wallace argued.\n\nTensions between Trump and the intelligence community ratcheted up quickly following last week's meeting after it was learned that the intelligence chiefs presented the President-elect with a two-page synopsis of unverified reports claiming the Russians had obtained compromising personal and financial information about him.\n\nIn a news conference on Wednesday, Trump aligned himself for the first time with the intelligence community by acknowledging that Russia was responsible for the hacking ahead of the election.\n\nBut Trump again revealed his apparent distrust of the intelligence agencies by expressing his deep anger with the leak of the unverified intelligence report. The President-elect suggested on Twitter Wednesday that the intelligence community may have been responsible for the leak in order to take what he says was \"one last shot\" at him. \"Are we living in Nazi Germany,\" Trump then asked.\n\nWallace also remarked on the platform and support that Julian Assange, the fugitive founder of WikiLeaks, has been given by some Republicans -- notably from Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin -- as he criticizes the intelligence community and adamantly denies their assessment that Russia was the source of the Democratic Party emails his organization published during the campaign.\n\n\"I think that the embrace of Assange by conservatives has been disgraceful,\" Wallace said. \"People forget who this guy was.\"\n\nJust last week, Assange defended himself in an extended sit-down interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, a vocal Trump supporter and an anchor on the channel. While Hannity has in the past accused Assange and his organization of \"waging war against the US,\" he lauded the WikiLeaks founder for publishing the contents of the hacked emails.\n\n\"America owes you a debt of gratitude,\" Hannity told Assange in a radio interview last month.\n\nDuring the hour-long conversation, Wallace also addressed the debate on Capitol Hill over the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. As congressional Republicans work to fashion a health care plan to come soon after they fulfill their long-held promise to repeal the law, Wallace suggested they proceed with caution or pay a political price.\n\n\"If they repeal it, they're going to own it,\" he said. \"And if they start taking away the good parts of Obamacare, they're going to pay a huge political price on it.\"\n\nBut Wallace argued that a portion of blame for this legislative dilemma must be placed on the Obama administration, which he feels could have done more to win bipartisan support for the health care law, which passed with no Republican votes.\n\nAllowing that he wasn't in the room for the negotiations and therefore was not privy to every detail, Wallace maintained that, \"as a pretty close observer, it looked to me like you could have done more\" to gain Republican backing.\n\n\"Because it became such a political issue,\" Wallace continued, \"now you've got the possibility that it's going to be largely undone as a political issue, which I think is terribly sad.\"\n\nTo hear the whole conversation with Wallace, which also covered his views on the state of the news media and the potential changes coming to the White House Briefing Room during the Trump administration, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

Under state law, he was replaced, and the alternate voted for Clinton. \n\nProtests had popped up around the country Monday as frustrated Americans sought one last opportunity to stop the candidate they opposed. \n\nFrom immigrant to elector: 'Living the American Dream'\n\nBut mass defections of electors was always extremely unlikely. \n\nThirty-seven of Trump's pledged 306 electors would have had to vote against him, becoming so-called \"faithless electors,\" to keep him under the 270 threshold to become President. If Clinton were to reach 270 in that far-fetched scenario, she could have become President. If no candidate reached 270, the House of Representatives would have held a vote when Congress reconvenes in January. \n\nThere have been a handful faithless electors in past cycles, though never enough to change the outcome of the race. \n\nOhio Secretary of State Jon Husted, whose state was won by Trump, tweeted a picture of the ballot for electors in his state.

Asked if he actually expected any outcome other than 29 votes for Trump, Democracy Spring's Maxwell Frost sighed. \"I'm hoping for the best,\" he said. \"We'll see what happens.\"\n\nWhat happens in the extremely unlikely scenario the Electoral College goes rogue? \n\nWhile Trump has claimed he won in a landslide victory, that description is inaccurate. He is expected to garner just 56.9% of the electoral vote, assuming all electors vote according to their states' results. That will give Trump the 44th-largest share of the electoral vote out of 54 presidential elections since the modern system started in 1804.\n\nThe electoral votes will be officially counted on January 6, when Congress returns. Vice President Joe Biden will preside over the count.\n\nLawmakers can technically object -- in writing, with objections signed by at least one House and one Senate member -- to individual electoral votes or entire states' results. If the House and Senate support that objection, the vote or votes in question are thrown out. But that has never happened.\n\nTrump will be officially set for his inauguration at noon on January 20 once all the electoral votes are counted.

The UAE is pushing against this rising tide by creating a model that can serve as a road map for others to promote greater tolerance and openness. \n\nUnique government policies, innovative partnerships and interfaith dialogues are three of the ways the UAE is leading by example. \n\nJust this month, the UAE hosted a group of religious leaders -- including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the Grand Imam of al-Azhar, Dr. Ahmed el-Tayeb -- the centers of the Anglican Church and Sunni Islam -- for a frank, honest conversation about how to create more open and tolerant societies. The two leaders were in Abu Dhabi, highlighting shared values and advocating for greater compassion and acceptance of all cultures.\n\nThese are the same values shared by Emiratis, and have been ingrained in the UAE's DNA since my country's founding in 1971. It is why over 200 nationalities call the UAE home. It is why different religions have built 40 churches and three temples (with a fourth on the way) in my country. \n\nThese innate values are also why the UAE government and private sector have made such great strides to promote tolerance on a national, and even international, scale.  \n\nThrough government initiatives, policy organizations and our own rule of law, we're creating a place where people from all backgrounds, faiths, nationalities and perspectives can join together to learn, engage in artistic expression, and exchange ideas. \n\nThe UAE recently established a National Tolerance Program and appointed the world's first tolerance minister, Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi, who is tasked with strengthening the government's role as an \"incubator\" of tolerance. At a time when the world is filled with so much bigotry, the creation of this ministry is crucial in promoting tolerance, coexistence and respect for others throughout the UAE.  \n\nJust recently, the UAE Cabinet also voted to implement the Charter of Tolerance, Coexistence and Peace. This set of agreements -- which embraces cultural diversity, and rejects violence, extremism and racism for all citizens, residents and employees in the UAE -- is the platform on which the National Tolerance Program operates and achieves its goals.\n\nSeveral organizations -- including the General Authority for Islamic Affairs and Endowment, the Muslim Council of Elders and the Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies -- promote tolerant teachings of Islam and peace within Muslim societies through the dissemination of the true values of Islam. \n\nWhether these organizations are operating call centers that field questions about Islam, or hosting conferences that spread themes of peace and cooperation, they play a vital role in amplifying the UAE's values.\n\nThese initiatives are unique in the Middle East, and can serve as an example and road map for others in the region to follow. However, none of this would work without having the right laws on the books. \n\nThe UAE constitution explicitly guarantees freedom for all to exercise religious worship of their choosing. There are also anti-discriminatory laws in place that forbid citizens and residents from discriminating against anyone because of class, culture or religion.  \n\nThese laws and national programs are how the archbishop and the imam are able to meet and discuss such important issues together in a church, a church situated in a country with a population that is over 75% Muslim.\n\nImportantly, being tolerant does not mean acquiescing to those who view tolerance with hatred and scorn, and seek to destabilize the region by fomenting sectarianism and fanaticism. In fact, the UAE remains steadfast in its commitment to combat and overcome all forms of extremism and terrorism. \n\nCurrently, a military battle is being waged to drive ISIS from Mosul, Iraq, and victory there will be a turning point in the international community's efforts to defeat this terrorist group. However, the UAE is equally committed to fighting a less visible battle of values and ideas, which will set a course for a more stable and prosperous Middle East region.\n\nAs the world observes the International Day of Tolerance, we must learn to live with each other, and engage genuinely with people from other backgrounds. It's how we learn; how we grow; and in the end, how we become better -- as individuals and as a society. \n\nThe UAE has been doing this for decades. And as Emiratis look to the future, we will continue to pursue a different path for the Middle East based on tolerance, openness and coexistence.

Each inauguration, including Friday's, has been legal and fully in accordance with the United States Constitution. Yet much that the new president has said and proposes to do now that he has become the President is causing many people, most notably Congressman John Lewis earlier this month, to question the legitimacy of his presidency even before he takes the oath. \n\nFor those of us in law enforcement, the word \"legitimacy\" has a very precise and consequential meaning. For us, it does not describe the authority we acquire by law, after we have sworn our oath. For us, legitimacy is something that comes after the swearing-in. It is something we acquire only after we are on the streets. It is an honor we earn from the people we serve. \n\nLet me say that, as a former deputy sheriff and a current police executive, I feel the pain -- or what certainly should be the pain -- of our new president whose legitimacy has been challenged. For both police officers and presidents, legal authority is necessary, but it is not sufficient. Both jobs also require the people to vote their legitimacy. No law governs this. In the case of the president, legitimacy is not the result of an election held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Instead, it comes from the genuinely popular election that is held every single day after the inauguration. Day by day, the people decide whether or not to vote their leader legitimate. Every day, the President, like the police officer, must earn legitimacy by all he says and does. \n\nAs legitimacy is not conferred by law upon the taking of an oath, so you don't have to break the law to lose your legitimacy. It is the people who confer legitimacy upon us. They do so only if we demonstrate fairness and complete transparency in the way we treat the members of the community and help to resolve their disputes. A patrol officer can operate \"strictly by the book\" and still be denied legitimacy if he or she fails to treat people with respect, is not open and upfront about what he or she does, makes arrests just because the law says an officer can, or shows no empathy because empathy is required by no law. \n\nAt the core of legitimacy is procedural justice. Now, nothing is more destructive to procedural justice than bias. Bias is a common, maybe universal human trait. Most police jurisdictions recognize this and therefore take steps to train their officers to recognize and overcome their biases. They do this not just because the 14th Amendment guarantees the right to \"equal protection of the laws,\" but because only by acting without bias can a police agency earn legitimacy. \n\nI appreciated the way in which Donald Trump reached out to the people in December with what he has called his \"thank you tour,\" but I worried that the tour itinerary gave the appearance of bias because it was confined to states and places that supported his election. More recently, I have had concerns about the intemperate disrespect he has shown to members of the press. As a law enforcement executive, I can tell you that I regard the press as an invaluable ally in creating trust with the public. They deserve respect. The same is true of the intelligence community (IC), the vital eyes and ears of the President and the entire executive branch, which includes our federal partners in law enforcement. To publicly denigrate the IC, as Mr. Trump has done, is to administer a senseless self-inflicted wound.\n\nAs we in law enforcement swear oaths to serve and protect everyone in our community, so a president needs to show himself as president of all the people all the time. With some anxiety, therefore, I worry if the our new President intends to continue employing, after he assumes office, a private security force at certain public events. During the campaign, the mission of this security cadre was largely to suppress or eject hecklers, something the Secret Service, sworn to uphold the Constitution, including its First Amendment right to free speech, cannot and will not do. Paying an unsworn squad to suppress the free expression of dissent does not build legitimacy.\n\nI hope and I pray that our new President will lead in ways that earn him the legitimacy every president needs, regardless of the law, regardless of the result of an election. We all have a stake in the legitimacy of our president's authority. Our nation needs legitimate leaders. For me and for others in the law enforcement community, the need for legitimacy in the highest office is especially important. During his campaign, Donald Trump called himself the \"law and order candidate.\" I applauded that because it put the 45th president in line with the very first. George Washington described himself as the nation's \"Chief Magistrate,\" a steward of law and order. As the first president, Washington defined the job. As he saw it, the president's primary role was to execute and enforce the laws Congress enacted. President Trump has promised to do the same, and so I feel a brotherhood with our new Chief Magistrate. We both promise a commitment to law and order. \n\nThat is why I appeal to Donald Trump to open his presidency by reading the Final Report of the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. It was my honor in 2015 to have been appointed to that task force by Barack Obama, and I can assure the new \"Chief Magistrate\" that my fellow members and I put into the Final Report everything we have learned about the importance of legitimacy in policing. Each of us on that task force understood that, for most Americans most of the time, the police are the government. Whether saving a life, showing a citizen the way to the Post Office, peacefully resolving a dispute on the street, intervening in a dangerous domestic dispute, delivering a new baby, or explaining why a traffic ticket must be issued, the police officer both represents and embodies the power and authority of the government. It is their duty to act without bias and with respect and empathy, so that the power and authority of a government of law earns legitimacy. \n\nI can assure our new President that we of the law enforcement community will, by our actions, earn the legitimacy that will help him to govern. In turn, we ask him to govern in ways that will also earn legitimacy. As police officers and as Americans, we need this.

What does January 20, 2017, mean?\" said de Le\u00f3n, California's first Latino elected leader of the state Senate in more than a century. \n\nHe's sharing with them the same unwavering message: \"We don't want to fight. We're not looking for a fight. But if necessary, we will fight to protect the values of California. Given what I've seen so far with regard to the Cabinet selections, there probably is going to be a fight around the corner very, very soon.\"\n\nThe looming battle pits America's largest and most progressive state against the incoming Trump administration. California is 13% of the US economy, with a GDP bigger than Brazil, growing faster than the economies of Japan, Germany or the UK. The state, which is 40% Latino, voted in more Democrats to the state legislature (where it holds a two-thirds majority in both houses) and is growing more progressive on issues such as the environment, minimum wage, gay rights and immigration.\n\nCalifornia's Democratic supermajority mandate and its economic heft is what de Le\u00f3n will leverage against Trump. De Leon, with Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, introduced sweeping state legislation to blunt Trump's expected immigration policies. \n\nThe measures, expected to pass early in the new year, would offer undocumented immigrants more access to legal help and would further spell out the limits of local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration agents. De Le\u00f3n acknowledges the limits of state action, but pledges to protect the families split along immigration status.\n\n\"We can't prohibit them (the federal government) from doing what they want to do, if they want to do mass deportations. But we surely don't have to help them,\" said de Le\u00f3n. \n\nA message left with the Trump transition team was not immediately returned.\n\nAnother option to slow Trump is to file lawsuits to blunt federal action.\n\nAt stake in this opening salvo of California vs. DC is hundreds of millions in federal funding. Trump has pledged to cut federal funding for so-called \"sanctuary\" cities. With all major California cities declaring themselves sanctuaries, from Los Angeles to San Francisco to Sacramento, de Le\u00f3n said, \"If you punish California, you're punishing the rest of the country. We're 13% of the overall GDP of this nation. To go out of your way to hurt California, ends up hurting the nation. It's my hope that there won't be political retribution, that a Trump administration won't deny funds because of this undefined sanctuary city or state status.\"\n\nCalifornia, while overwhelmingly Democratic, did have 4 million people vote for Trump. Those voters want federal immigration laws followed, said Robin Hvidston, executive director of We the People Rising, a conservative grassroots group in Los Angeles. She said state lawmakers are enacting protective measures before Trump has had a chance to act, creating \"hysteria in our state.\"\n\n\"We should be a state that upholds and respects the law,\" said Hvidston. \"That's what our lawmakers should be focused on in Sacramento, not working with or encouraging people in our state who are here illegally.\"\n\nDe Le\u00f3n is hardly alone in his positions in California, joined by mayors and police chiefs across the state and by leaders in Sacramento. Both leaders of the chambers of the state legislature are Latino, as is the incoming state attorney general, Xavier Becerra.\n\nDe Le\u00f3n also has a uniquely personal view of undocumented immigration: his mother was undocumented. A single mother of three with a third-grade education, she brought her son on San Diego public buses to the mansions of La Jolla, California, where she cleaned houses. \n\nThat boy would grow up to enter California politics, informed by his upbringing as he's spent his legislative career pushing progressive measures on the environment, worker's and women's rights, and immigration.\n\n\"It is personal when the incoming head of state and others that surround him demonize and scapegoat and pit one group against one another for a political objective,\" said de Le\u00f3n.\n\nThe state Senate leader also pledges California will lead the opposition for the rest of the country's voters who do not support Trump's agenda. \n\n\"They can look to California to lead the way,\" he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.68948650360107, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 746, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.79152143749, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 9, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 51, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161223010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.83646112600536, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.63636363636}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/health/questions-about-obamacare-answered/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1277, "scraper_regex": 1387}}, "headline": "What to know about the future of Obamacare", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1387, "date": "20161128140000", "story_content": "The election has ended, and a new President and new Congress will take office in January. Among the most heated issues during the campaign season was the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. \n\nThe law, which was signed in 2010, has faced mixed reviews since its inception, from both politicians and the public.\n\nThe most recent Health Tracking Poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit focused on health policy, found an even split in the public's opinion of Obamacare. Equal numbers of Americans -- 45% -- said their view was favorable or unfavorable.\n\nThe public never seemed to learn the nitty-gritty of the law, according to Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at Kaiser.\n\n\"People don't really know that much about the law and how it works, and their understanding is shaped by stuff they pick up here or there on the news or social media,\" Pollitz said. \"This has been a problem all along with the Affordable Care Act that our tracking polls have just, sadly, documented year after year.\"\n\nAll the buzz about a possible repeal under President Trump, said Pollitz, has raised even more questions.\n\nTo help understand Obamacare today, here are answers to seven common questions.\n\nWill Obamacare be repealed?  \n\nBoth President-elect Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have said that repealing and replacing Obamacare is a legislative priority.\n\nIn an interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes\" after the election, Trump repeated his intention to replace the ACA. \n\n\"We're going to repeal it and replace it,\" he said. Though he said his new plan would offer \"great health care for much less money,\" he did not outline a replacement plan.\n\nYet, after his 90-minute meeting with President Obama in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump seemed to be reconsidering this policy, based on remarks he made to The Wall Street Journal.  \n\n\"Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,\" he said, adding that he told Obama he \"will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that.\"\n\nThe GOP-led House of Representatives has voted to repeal Obamacare multiple times, so most observers believe it will probably do so again.\n\nDespite the firmly stated intentions of Trump and the Republican Party, pulling the plug on Obamacare is \"unlikely,\" given a probable filibuster by Senate Democrats, Michael Sparer of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University wrote in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nSparer believes Obamacare will undergo major changes, with Republicans repealing significant portions of the law through the budget reconciliation process, which cannot be filibustered. He notes, though, that all of Obamacare cannot be repealed that way. \n\nWhat would replace Obamacare? \n\nThis is not entirely clear, though Trump has outlined some of his intentions on his website and along the campaign trail. According to the plan, Obamacare will be replaced with tax-free health savings accounts. Account funds will be available for use by any family member and can accumulate over time and can be transferred, tax-free, to all heirs.  \n\nTrump's website also indicates that he hopes to create a \"dynamic market\" by allowing insurers to sell policies across state lines. Those who buy insurance in this market would deduct their premiums on their tax returns.\n\nUnder Trump, Medicaid would be managed and administered by individual states and funded by block grants: a fixed amount of federal money.  Trump's website also indicates that he will work with states to establish high-risk pools to ensure access to coverage for people who want it, including those who have not maintained continuous coverage. \n\nTrump's website notes that he hopes to increase price transparency for health care services and to allow consumers to import drugs from overseas.\n\nIt also says the individual mandate must be eliminated: \"No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.\"\n\n\"Everybody's got to be covered,\" he said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year. \"I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.\"\n\nWhat happens to people with pre-existing conditions?\n\nObamacare prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, such as cancer, or charging people higher or lower fees based on their health status.\n\nAt CNN's GOP debate in February, Trump said he would get rid of Obamacare but maintain the provision that insurers must cover people with pre-existing conditions. \n\n\"I want to keep pre-existing conditions. I think we need it. I think it's a modern age. And I think we have to have it,\" he said.\n\nAfter meeting with Obama, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he would like to keep the provision forbidding discrimination based on pre-existing conditions.\n\nAnd this month on \"60 Minutes,\" he repeated his wish to continue coverage for those individuals.\n\n\"It happens to be one of the strongest assets,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat happens to children on their parents' insurance?\n\nCurrently, Obamacare allows young adults to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26.\n\nOn \"60 Minutes,\" Trump said he would try to keep this measure in place if he repeals and replaces Obamacare.\n\nWhat happens to birth control expenses?\n\nCurrently, it is possible to get free birth control under the Affordable Care Act. By law, Obamacare health plans must cover, without charging out-of-pocket fees, at least one type of birth control in each of the 18 Food and Drug Administration-approved categories. \n\nA repeal of Obamacare, then, might imperil women's access to free birth control unless a replacement continues this provision.\n\nGenerally, it is unclear where Trump stands on the issue of birth control. During a September interview on \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" he said he's not in favor of requiring a prescription to purchase birth control. \n\n\"I would say it should not be a prescription; it should not be done by prescription,\" he said. \n\nNotably, despite the fact that the FDA has never approved hormonal contraceptive products for over-the-counter sale, three West Coast states allow pharmacies to sell these products without a doctor's prescription. \n\nTrump's website indicates that he intends to remove barriers for drug providers that offer safe, reliable and cheaper products. So this commitment to lower drug costs, combined with Trump's opinion that contraceptives be available without prescription, could mean low-cost, though not entirely free, over-the-counter contraceptives will be available even if Obamacare is repealed.\n\nWhen would changes to Obamacare occur? \n\nSixty Senate votes are required to overcome a filibuster. To reach 60 votes, at least eight Democrats would be required to lend their support to the Republican agenda. Although the Democratic Party says it will not undermine the law, Republicans believe they might be able to convince some moderate Democrats -- especially those running for re-election in 2018 in more conservative states -- to vote for health care legislation.\n\nRepublicans have suggested that passing a replacement bill could take up two years.\n\n\"We're not going to have, like, a two-day period, and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing,\" Trump said on \"60 Minutes\" this month.\n\nShould I still sign up for a 2017 plan?\n\nIf you have no health insurance and want it, sign up for a plan during the open enrollment period, which runs through January 31.  \n\n\"It's available. It's open enrollment. There are subsidies and people who can help you. All of that is still in place,\" Kaiser's Pollitz said.\n\nPolicies and premiums displayed on marketplace websites during open enrollment will be in effect throughout 2017, with plans written for a full calendar year.  That said, people are not obligated to continue their policies for a full year. If you got a job with health benefits, say, or if repeal does occur, you would not be required to remain enrolled and continue paying premiums.\n\nHowever, the plan would be obliged to pay any claims you had incurred up until the time the coverage stopped, explained Pollitz.  \n\nCurrently, under Obamacare, people who can afford but do not purchase insurance must pay an individual mandate penalty when filing their income taxes.

Bush tried it. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton tried it. Now Donald Trump is vowing to reset relations with Russia.\n\nBut could the unintended costs outweigh the benefits?\n\nThe President-elect's Russian gambit seems like a solid foreign policy goal, given that the estrangement between the rivals -- owners of the world's biggest nuclear arsenals -- is deeper than at any time since the Cold War.\n\nAn improvement in relations could yield gains for the United States in reviving non-proliferation projects and closer anti-terrorism cooperation.\n\nBut there are big questions about whether Trump will be any more successful than his predecessors, whose initial inroads eventually foundered largely due to the behavior of President Vladimir Putin, and whether he will end up emboldening a leader that many -- including key Republicans in Congress -- see as a top US adversary.\n\nTrump has made no secret of his admiration for the Russian strongman, once saying he was a better leader than Obama, and on the campaign trail showed little concern about resurgent Russian influence. By nominating Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, Trump has pleased Moscow, where the ExxonMobil CEO has good relationships with senior officials including Putin.\n\nAnd even some Russia skeptics can see the merit in trying to improve relations.\n\n\"This could be the time for us to make a move and work things out with Russia to some extent,\" New York Rep. Peter King told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday. \"I am confident that Donald Trump will not be taken in -- there is some room for negotiations with Russia here, but we should do it with a strong hand.\"\n\nMORE: Trump's most dangerous best friend\n\nWill Trump turn a blind eye?\n\nBut Trump's determination to find new areas where the two sides can work together could necessitate that Washington turn a blind eye to behavior by Putin on issues like human rights and the central rationale of his foreign policy -- restoring Russian influence at the direct expense of the United States.\n\nIndeed, easing the suspicion between Moscow and Washington could come with some serious negatives.\n\nAn improved relationship with Russia might require the United States to drop its opposition to the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea, and the lifting of sanctions against top Russian officials to punish the land grab from Ukraine.\n\nIn Syria, the US may need to abandon its support for moderate rebels and effectively align itself with a regime accused of war crimes and behind brutal violence in Aleppo. NATO members may be further shaken by a rapprochement between the White House and the Kremlin following Trump's campaign trail critiques of the alliance.\n\nIf moves like lifting sanctions occur, the Trump administration would establish a precedent that could embolden Russia's attempt to throw its weight around in the rest of the world.\n\nSteven Pifer, a Brookings Institution scholar and former US ambassador to Ukraine, said the effects of Russian aggression in the Eastern European country go far beyond that conflict.\n\n\"Simply accepting Russian behavior that is truly egregious\" would prove problematic to US efforts to halting Russian meddling around the world, according to Pifer. \"If we were to recognize Crimea as Russian, that would put us in the likes of a handful of countries like North Korea, Syria and Venezuela,\" he said.\n\n\"Are we prepared to let the Russians get away with the actions of eastern Ukraine?\" he said, adding that would concede a sphere of influence to the Russians and rattle the nerves of US allies in the Baltic region.\n\nTo revive relations with Moscow, President Trump would also have to shrug his shoulders at any findings from congressional and White House-mandated investigations into allegations that Russia hacked the presidential elections. His refusal to believe assessments by US intelligence agencies that Moscow intervened in the presidential election, though, suggests that would not be a problem for the new occupant of the Oval Office.\n\nCould Trump lift Russia sanctions?\n\nTrump would not even have to consult with US allies over lifting sanctions. He could accomplish that by a pen stroke since they were mandated by Obama in a series of executive orders.\n\nThe choice of Tillerson, who is on the record as opposing sanctions -- which have cost ExxonMobil lucrative energy exploration contracts in Russia -- is being read as another hint by Trump of a sharp shift in US policy toward Moscow and has not gone down well at the current White House.\n\n\"Throughout his campaign, the President-elect indicated his intent, if elected president, to pursue warmer relations with Russia. So what better way to do that than to choose somebody who's been awarded the Order of Friendship by Vladimir Putin to be your secretary of state?\" spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday.\n\nIt's possible that the geopolitical and strategic considerations that shape the US-Russia relationship will dictate the pace and breadth of Trump's engagement, regardless of his past statements or future intentions.\n\n\"I think US policy especially with respect to a big geopolitical actor like a Russia or China is more often driven by the shape of the broader world and US and Russian interests in it than it is driven by the individual proclivities of a US president or a Russian president,\" said Matthew Rojansky, a Russia expert at the Wilson Center.\n\nSyria: An opportunity and a risk\n\nThe central focus of Trump's work to improve the US relationship with Russia could come in the Middle East, where Trump has said the US needs to urgently reevaluate its strategy in fighting ISIS, particularly in Syria.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be nice if we got along with Russia?\" Trump said repeatedly on the campaign trail. \"Wouldn't it be nice if we got together with Russia and knocked the hell out of ISIS?\"\n\nThe US has repeatedly sought to forge agreements to both join forces with Russia in combating ISIS and to bring an end to the Syrian civil war, efforts that last broke down in October over Russia's ongoing efforts to prop up the Syrian regime and its attacks on US-backed moderate rebels.\n\nIn his first post-election interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump criticized the US's backing of moderate rebels fighting the Syrian regime and suggested he was more interested in fighting ISIS alongside Russia than pushing for the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nTrump has sought to simplify the US's role in the conflict in Syria, boiling down the campaign to destroying ISIS and making everything else secondary to that objective.\n\nNoting that the Russians have \"one very simple objective, which is to help Assad,\" CATO institute senior fellow Doug Bandow argued the US could benefit from paring down its objectives in Syria.\n\n\"We want to get rid of Assad, stop ISIS, work with the Kurds, keep the Turks happy, only help the moderates,\" Bandow, who has argued against the US deepening its military involvement in Syria, said of the current situation.\n\nHe continued, \"For all of Trump's lack of sophistication -- which is quite clear and is a problem -- he still has some basic understanding that priorities have to be set and you can't do everything.\"\n\nBut even cooperation on combating ISIS would raise serious problems for the US's standing in the Middle East and raise a slew of questions about how that would impact the decades-long battle for influence between the two countries in the Middle East.\n\nThe US has held the line on its calls for Assad to step down from power both because of the egregious human rights violations he has committed, but also with an eye toward greater US influence in the region. Ceding that point would ensure Russia can preserve a key ally in the region, strengthening its influence in the Middle East.\n\nUS support for Russia's role in Syria and in turn the Syrian government could also damage America's standing and popular support throughout the Middle East, particularly among allies who have decried the Syrian government's slaughter of tens of thousands of civilians.\n\nRussians have gained influence in recent years through its support of the Iranian regime, which in turn has gained a sturdy foothold in Iraq in recent years.\n\nGlobally, a more accommodating US relationship with Russia could allow Moscow the space to rebuild the Cold War-era influence that the US spent decades deflating.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.65613794326782, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1303, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 11, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.47125147128, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0698388334612403, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/republicans-donald-trump/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Trump's talk puts GOP in a jam", "wordcount_as_scraped": 981, "date": "20170126000000", "story_content": "In a closed-door meeting Wednesday, House and Senate Republican leaders stressed the importance of party unity and to avoid intraparty fights that could threaten the GOP hold of Washington. \n\nBut they quickly ran into a problem: President Donald Trump.\n\nPublicly, Republicans recoiled at Trump's talk of mass voter fraud in the November elections, urging him not to use government resources to investigate a problem many in the party believe the president has vastly exaggerated -- and even Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said he wouldn't look into the matter. They dodged questions about whether Congress would appropriate billions of dollars to pay for Trump's wall along the border of Mexico.  \n\nSeveral pushed back at Trump's suggestion that he may seek to restart harsh interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, that are widely considered torture. And all this comes after Trump engaged in a fight with the media over the size of inauguration crowd, distracting from the focus of his ambitious legislative agenda at the start of his presidency. \n\nThe message many want the new President to take: Don't undercut yourself.\n\n\"Fighting over crowd size and things like that takes us off message,\" Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois told CNN. \"If I were advising him -- and he hasn't called me -- I'd advise him and his team to stay on message, which is jobs, jobs, jobs and manufacturing.\" \n\nFunding the wall\n\nDespite Trump's distracting tweets and comments, the party is trying to move quickly to unite their legislative agendas. In the private meeting Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan told Republicans that the party is considering funding Trump's border wall with Mexico through a supplemental funding package focused on border security, according to multiple attendees.\n\nDoing so could extricate the border fight from a bill that must pass to keep the government open. \n\nBut a number of Republicans are nervous about funding the wall, refusing to say if they'd back a plan to have taxpayers pay potentially billions of dollars for the project. Trump has repeatedly said he plans to have Mexico reimburse the US for the wall after initially just saying Mexico would pay for it, though many are skeptical that such an approach will work.\n\n\"When it comes to our budget, we'll have those discussions,\" said Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, refusing to say three times if he'd support Congress appropriating money for the wall. \n\nPrivately, Trump convinced Ryan to prioritize a package authorizing new infrastructure projects as part of a 200-day legislative agenda for the new administration, according to one of Trump's top allies, Rep. Chris Collins of New York. Many conservatives, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, want the new infrastructure spending to be offset with spending cuts. McConnell made that case in a private White House meeting with Trump earlier this week, sources said.\n\nRyan also told members that the effort to boost infrastructure would come through various legislative proposals, such as upgrading airports, rather than one comprehensive bill, sources said.\n\n\"Initially, without the President's input, that would not have been the case,\" Collins told reporters. \"Our President has been pretty clear on setting his priorities.\"\n\nBut some of his priorities have prompted pushback, including Trump's openness to reinstating waterboarding and other harsh interrogation tactics.\n\n\"Those issues are settled law,\" said Sen. John Thune, No. 3 in the Senate GOP leadership, referring to a ban on waterboarding. \"Congress has spoken.\" \n\nIn a statement, Sen. John McCain of Arizona added: \"The President can sign whatever executive orders he likes. But the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the United States of America.\"\n\nStanding ovation for McConnell after Supreme Court move\n\nTrump and Vice President Mike Pence are set to address congressional Republicans on Thursday here in Philadelphia. Ahead of the speeches, McConnell and Ryan, speaking privately to Republican lawmakers, laid out their legislative plans -- starting with repealing Obamacare, reforming the tax code, gutting regulations and confirming Trump's Supreme Court nominee. \n\nBut McConnell warned House Republicans not to get impatient with the deliberative nature of the Senate, saying there are limits to what his conference can accomplish with 52 members in a body where 60 votes are needed to get most things accomplished. Some House Republicans were not convinced.\n\nYet the mood was optimistic in the congressional meeting, attendees said. At one point, McConnell got a standing ovation when he said that it was his decision to leave the final Supreme Court seat vacant in the final year of Barack Obama's presidency, attendees said.\n\nBut with so many items left on the agenda, Republicans are eager for Trump to focus his energy on specific legislative initiatives -- rather than other matters, like his call for a \"major\" investigation into mass fraud during the elections.\n\nChaffetz dismissed the topic, telling reporters \"On the voter fraud issue, that really happens at the county level. I don't see any evidence.  But the President has 100,000 people at the Department of Justice and if he wants to have an investigation, have at it.  I just don't see any evidence of it.\"\n\n\"The oversight committee is not planning to do anything with it. If the President sees that, he's got a 100,000 he can task with doing that.\"\n\n\"I think it's very important that people have confidence in the elections and the outcome of those elections,\" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, the No. 4 GOP leader in the House.\n\n\"I view the election as history, and we're ready to roll up our sleeves and go to work,\" Thune said. \n\nAsked about whether they were concerned about the White House not coordinating with congressional Republicans on their message and rollouts, Thune chalked up the bumpy start to a new administration in \"transition\" and noted that even the House and Senate Republicans often find themselves on opposite pages.\n\n\"It's a work in progress,\" Thune said with a laugh, as he looked over at McMorris Rodgers.

Since the country's return to democracy 27 years ago, journalists have had almost unrestricted access to the corridors of power, catching politicians unaware and harassing them with questions.\n\nTo many in Poland, this access was regarded as a fine example of Polish democracy -- but to the country's government, which has never had an easy relationship with the media, it was an unwanted privilege that the press, they claimed, had abused. To solve the problem, the government proposed slashing the number of journalists with parliamentary accreditation and creating a media center where politicians could meet the press on their own terms.\n\nThis triggered outrage in the Polish media and prompted accusations that the government was trying to silence the press.\n\nIt also led to the protests in the parliament by opposition lawmakers that, in turn, led to the parliamentary speaker hastily arranging a meeting of Law and Justice politicians in another room, where they then voted through next year's state budget with a show of hands.\n\nThe informal nature of the vote sparked claims from opposition lawmakers that they had been prevented from attending the meeting. It also drew prompt condemnation from furious opposition leaders who claimed having a parliamentary vote outside the chamber was both illegal and a violation of the Polish constitution.\n\nGrzegorz Schetyna, leader of Civic Platform, Poland's main opposition party, said Saturday he had reported the vote to the Warsaw prosecutor's office, saying that \"all those who broke the law should answer for it.\"\n\nIt was also the first time since Poland shed communist rule in 1989 that a parliamentary sitting had been held outside the chamber of the lower house.\n\nThe political fighting over media access and the budget vote is the latest controversy to hit the Polish government. Since coming into power a little more than a year ago, the socially conservative Law and Justice government has launched root-and-branch overhauls of the country's highest court, publically run media, the armed forces and the civil service in a campaign it claims is necessary to modernize the institutions and rid them of bias and corruption.\n\nBut to its critics, the campaign's real goal is to undermine the basic principles of democracy and try to turn the Central European country into a one-party state once again. The policies have also deepened and widened a bitter political divide in Poland that, at the moment, appears beyond any hope of reconciliation.\n\nThe Polish government is also under scrutiny by the European Union for alleged violations of rule of law, while at the same time Poland's hard-won international reputation as a successful and stable state with a buoyant economy has taken a battering.\n\nProtesters have vowed to take to the streets again to keep the pressure on the government.\n\n\"We will be on the streets until they are done destroying the country,\" Mateusz Kijowski, the leader of the Committee for the Defense of Democracy -- the movement that has spearheaded protests since Law and Justice came to power -- told demonstrators Saturday.\n\nBut while the government's opponents were quick to claim that the events of Friday and Saturday morning were a turning point in Polish politics, how they will affect the government is unclear. Since coming to power, Law and Justice has come under an almost constant bombardment of criticism over its apparent lack of commitment to democratic rights but at the same time has retained its popularity.\n\nGenerous social welfare programs and promises to clamp down on corruption and look after the people left behind by the country's economic progress have appealed to many Poles, giving Law and Justice a powerful position.\n\nThe party also enjoys an outright majority in the Polish parliament, so it is free to do what it wants and enact any legislation it deems necessary.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.02136754989624, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 875, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.50206550623, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161218020000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.6571428571428597, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/15/middleeast/aleppo-russia-playbook-walsh/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1146, "scraper_regex": 1220}}, "headline": "How Russia's playbook transformed the war in Syria", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1220, "date": "20161216120000", "story_content": "It's a war where nothing is unthinkable for long -- but the rebel loss of eastern Aleppo felt unthinkable.\n\nIt will likely come with the massacre of many surrendering fighters and innocent civilians, and take weeks to put into effect.\n\nBut now as the Syrian regime claims to have control of all of the largest city, we are dealing with yet another \"unthinkable\" happening.\n\nSlow radicalization\n\nWhy was the rebel hold on eastern Aleppo so important to what people used to call the \"revolution?\"\n\nIt was the main urban holdout the rebels first grabbed in summer of 2012, showing they were militarily effective, and held the regime forces to a stalemate.\n\nIt was where the world witnessed the double-tap barrel bombing by the regime of children and hospitals -- by the regime -- a phrase so laden with horror, it takes a while to unpack.\n\nIt was where too you could see the slow radicalization of the rebels over time. I remember the stark difference in traveling there between 2012, when we shared cigarettes and jokes, and -- after two years of devastation -- how in 2014 our producer was interrupted mid-interview by a woman concerned that part of her hair was exposed just outside her hijab.\n\nThat's not radicalism in and of itself, but it was very distant to the secular mob we first reported on. Even then, the flags of the then-al Qaeda affiliate, the Nusra Front, were easy to spot on the street.\n\nModerates still lived on there, in great numbers, but like the rest of the rebels, the slow grind of bombings and civilian massacres had turned ordinary people towards a more ruthless ideology.\n\nWhere can rebels run?\n\nThis is the key issue that befalls the rebels now that they have lost this, their main bolthole of urban legitimacy. There are two places they can run, and each says something about the future of the war ahead.\n\nFirst, rebel fighters can head northeast, to an enclave south of a former ISIS-held town of Jarablus, where the Turkish army has been pushing back ISIS, using Syrian moderate rebels as their ground troops.\n\nTheir progress has been slow, and rebels in these ranks say that now their fight is purely against ISIS, taking pressure off the Syrian regime. That option may appear less attractive for some fighters who have just seen their homes pounded by the Syrian and Russian advance in Aleppo.\n\nSecondly, those that can escape could head northwest. This takes them towards the province of Idlib. Since rebel forces swept into the area in 2015, Idlib has been a complex mix of rebels. \n\nSome are with what used to be called the Nusra Front, which is basically al Qaeda in Syria, a group proscribed and bombed by the United States. \n\nOthers are more moderate, like Ahrar al-Sham, yet even they still face scrutiny about their radicalism.\n\nThe war has seen many groups slowly change. Take Nour al-Din al-Zinki -- a rebel group that once got US assistance, but then saw it lapse because of their radical tendencies, which culminated in some of its fighters being videoed beheading a 12-year-old working with the regime. Al-Zinki were among the groups fighting in Aleppo's east. They may now try to flee.\n\nThis began as an uprising against tyranny, but has become an ugly war, and it has made both sides uglier as time has gone by.\n\nEchoes of North Caucasus\n\nThis likely geographical shift of Syria's rebels to the northwest of the country will aid Russia's narrative, already in the ascendant owing to the lack of a credible Western alternative. The moderates would, in the event of this flight, be physically closer to al Qaeda, Moscow will say, lending weight to their argument that they are just fighting \"terrorists.\"\n\nIt echoes the Russian playbook from the North Caucasus. Initially, after the second Chechen war ended in 2000, Russia was fighting a separatist movement. Yet slowly over time Moscow eradicated the moderate leadership and killed hundreds of young Chechen men in \"clean-up operations,\" leaving a smaller and smaller space for moderate thought.\n\nSlowly, through the Moscow theater siege in 2002, and then the Beslan school hostage crisis in 2004, radicals claimed the headlines. And now, more than a decade later, Russia is still fighting a small, fierce and only mildly impotent affiliate of the ISIS caliphate in its southern provinces.\n\nIn their mind, however, the plan worked. Russia removed the political space for the Chechen separatist movement, and turned all its enemies into radical terrorists it could tackle militarily with impunity.\n\nIt is, essentially, the polar policy opposite of the West's bid to seek a political middle ground and compromise. Russia seeks to dither in the political arena -- as we have seen in the turbulent but fruitless talks over a ceasefire for Aleppo in the last week -- and then pursues a flat and ferocious military solution.\n\nMoscow's timing is also apposite. The Obama administration does not want to get involved militarily in Syria and -- in this time of transition to Donald Trump's White House -- is unlikely to act on much international outrage.\n\nPutin seizes on US power gap\n\nThe US is about 40 days from a new President; no policy adopted now is guaranteed a long life span. Trump's choice for Secretary of State -- Rex Tillerson, a man with very close ties to Putin -- is still some time away from his first day of work.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has seized on this gap, and hopes to present the Trump administration with a fait accompli in Syria -- one with far less US alternatives.\n\nThe question now is, where does Russia want to stop? Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said that he hopes to regain control of all the country. That's unlikely, given the confidence of Kurdish separatists in the north in addition to the mess ISIS will leave behind.\n\nBut the Russians, along with Assad's Iranian and even Iraqi militia allies, have clearly sent a lot of hardware into the Aleppo arena. Does it all now go home or return to base? Unlikely.\n\nThe area of Idlib is home to an estimated two million people, and has al Qaeda affiliates in its midst. It is also about a 45-minute drive from Aleppo's city center. The Russians may have the firepower, will, and time to keep on going. Who is going to stop them?\n\nIn short, we are in a new phase of the civil war here. The Syrian moderate forces propped up just enough to not collapse by Gulf, American and other Western aid, are crumbling fast, if not gone from the picture.\n\nThe former rebellion is now in areas where an al Qaeda affiliate is powerful. Moscow and Damascus are finding its use of firepower against civilian areas can go unchallenged, but also now make a swift military difference. \n\nPresident Obama and the coalition have done little to prevent their advance.

Open!\" They are desperate to cross into Hungary, but a razor-wire fence, temporary blockade and a line of riot police stand in their way.\n\nAs tensions escalate, one voice rises above the fray: A balding, bearded man, wearing a black and white tracksuit top, attempts to negotiate with the officers. \"Nobody will make any problem to your country,\" he tells the officers at Horgos, near the town of Roszke, using a loudspeaker. \"Nobody will make any problem to any policeman. You must understand this -- we come here for peace, just to pass.\"\n\nAs he makes his appeal, the man points into the distance, appearing to indicate that the migrants hope only to pass through the Hungary-Serbia border on their way to other countries in the European Union.\n\nFootage of the incident, recorded by the Hungarian news site Index.hu in September 2015, shows the man stepping back from the temporary barrier before clashes break out. Migrants can be seen hurling objects at the police and forcing open the border gate. In response, riot police fire tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowd.\n\nThe man, identified in court as \"Ahmed H.,\" was sentenced to 10 years in prison Wednesday for taking part in the riot. \n\n'Act of terror'\n\nA court in Szeged, Hungary, this week found him guilty of using violence -- throwing rocks -- to force police into opening the border, deemed an \"act of terror\" under Hungarian law. \n\nIt also convicted Ahmed H., a Syrian who lives in Cyprus with his wife and children, of entering Hungary illegally. The 40-year-old is an EU resident and so could have crossed the Hungarian border legally.\n\nHe says he was there that day to help his elderly Syrian parents and other relatives, as they navigated their way along the Balkans route from Turkey to Germany. His parents were among a group arrested for allegedly taking part in the rioting. \n\n\"It was heartbreaking to see a man stand and face the wrath of the state,\" says Kartik Raj, Amnesty International's Europe Campaigner. \"It's unthinkable that he deserves 10 years in prison for effectively coming to the aid of his elderly parents and family fleeing Syria.\" \n\n\"It's a sadly predictable result in the context of the Hungarian government's appalling crackdown on the rights of migrants, twinned with this escalated, ramped up approach to terrorism law,\" Raj added.\n\nAmnesty International has called the verdict an \"alarming\" application of the country's anti-terrorism laws, which have tightened in recent months.\n\nThe case is emblematic of the Hungarian government's hardline stance on refugees, which has fueled xenophobic sentiment in the nation.\n\nTough immigration rules\n\nAnna Winogradowna, an activist with the Migrant Solidarity Group of Hungary (Migszol), was among a small group of protesters who demonstrated against Wednesday's verdict in Szeged.\n\n\"All the accusations against Ahmed were trying to conflate his being a Muslim with him being a terrorist,\" Winogradowna said. \"This connection that they're making -- Islam equates terrorism -- that's very symptomatic of the whole rhetoric in the country.\"\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban has previously said that \"every single migrant poses a public security and terror risk.\"\n\nHungary has been heavily criticized for its tough immigration measures since shuttering its border last September. \n\nIn addition to erecting an anti-refugee fence, the country has also criminalized the act of entering Hungary illegally -- a law that breaches international asylum treaties and under which Ahmed H. was convicted. Hungary has also started recruiting for 3,000 new \"border hunters\" to patrol the frontier with the police and army.\n\nOrban championed a campaign asking Hungarians to reject EU migrant quotas for the country in a controversial referendum in October. \n\nA government-financed booklet distributed to Hungarian households as part of the campaign reportedly linked migration to increased terrorism. Orban ultimately hailed the country's referendum as a victory, despite a low voter turnout that rendered its result invalid. \n\nAppeal for harsher sentence\n\nThe Prime Minister's communications office told CNN in an email: \"We do not wish to comment on ongoing cases, only after a final judgment was made,\" adding \"please remember that it was not the Government but the independent Hungarian judiciary that made this decision based on sound and video recordings as well as testimonies.\"\n\nAhmed H. was captured in photographs and footage by a number of other news agencies on September 16, 2015 -- one day after the Hungary-Serbia border was closed. Dozens of police officers, migrants and some journalists were injured in the violence on the same day.\n\nA video filmed by the Kremlin-backed broadcaster Russia Today shows Ahmed H. shaking his finger at riot police, saying, \"No, no,\" before violence broke out. \n\nOther footage, broadcast by Spain's TVE, shows him standing between police and a crowd of women and children. He can be heard telling reporters: \"We want only peace.\"\n\nBoth the prosecution and defense intend to appeal the verdict. The defense is seeking an acquittal, while the prosecution is hoping for a harsher sentence.  \n\nSpeaking at the Hungarian Permanent Conference in Budapest on Thursday, Orban welcomed the conviction.\n\nReferring to a government-sponsored advertising campaign featuring anti-immigrant sentiments, Orban said the message was on the billboard: If you come to Hungary you have to respect our laws, Hungarian news website 444.hu reported.

If they're out of the mainstream we'll oppose them tooth and nail.\"\n\nAnd asked the night before by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow if he would consider trying to keep the seat vacant -- leaving the court with only eight justices -- Schumer said, \"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"We are not going to make it easy for them to pick a Supreme Court justice,\" he said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell responded immediately.\n\n\"The American people simply will not tolerate\" Democrats blocking a Supreme Court nominee, he told reporters. \n\nIt is unclear when President-elect Donald Trump will nominate someone to fill the vacant seat on the bench.\n\nRatcheting up the debate could impact the type of person Trump selects. He has a list of 21 potential choices unveiled last year meant to appeal to conservatives. He has options. He could look for  alternatives not on the list, dig deep on the list to find someone who might garner less controversy, or go big by naming Judge William Pryor \u2014 a conservative favorite who also has attracted the most opposition from liberals. \n\nOthers on the list include Judge Diane Sykes of the 7th Court of Appeals, Judge Thomas Hardiman from the 3rd Circuit and Judge Steve Colloton from the 8th Circuit.  \n\nA Pryor nomination would be considered the least \"mainstream\" name on the list for liberals and could possibly force Republicans to push for a rules change and do away with the filibuster that is in place for the Supreme Court seat. Changing the rules is a delicate subject. Old Guard Republicans might push back. In 2013 when then Majority leader Harry Reid led the charge to get rid of the filibuster for lower court nominees, Sen. John McCain took to the floor.  \n\n\"We are approaching a slippery slope that will destroy the very unique aspect of this institution called the US Senate,\" he said. \n\nOf course it was Democrats who opened the door to a rules change when they got rid of the filibuster for the lower courts, something Schumer says he regrets. \n\n\"Wish it hadn't happened,\" Schumer told CNN's Dana Bash this week. \n\nThe argument could be made that Republicans would never have taken that first step. Secondly, there is a good chance that Trump will have more than one chance to name a Supreme Court Justice given that three justices are in their late 70's and early 80's. That seat could be the big fight as it would most likely move the court further to the conservative side. The argument: since that seat might prompt a rules change why not do it now?\n\nRichard Arenberg, a former staff member for three Democratic senators and co-author \"Defending the Filibuster: The Soul of the Senate\" wrote this week in the New York Times that the Republicans shouldn't weaken the filibuster. \n\n\"The Senate has historically been the one place in our government where legislative minorities are protected, with rules to check overzealous majorities,\" Arenberg wrote. He said Republicans have other options such as using public opinion to force votes, requiring debate around the clock and focusing on endangered Democratic senators who must run for re-election in 2018 in states that Trump won. \n\nThe irony of the debate is not lost on anyone. \n\nAfter Schumer suggested he might work to hold the seat open, conservative Ed Whelan tweeted \"seems like just yesterday that Left insisted that having only eight justices is a constitutional crisis.\"  \n\nAnd when McConnell said that the American people would not allow the seat to remain open Jason Steed, an appellate  lawyer, posted on twitter a fake picture of a head exploding referencing the fact that it was the Republicans just a few months ago who held the seat open.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation's John Malcolm has praised Trump's list of 21 and sees a big difference now that the election is over. After Justice Antonin Scalia's death, McConnell said the seat should not be filled so close to the election so that the American people could choose. \n\nMalcolm told the Daily Signal that voters were faced with the concept of a liberal majority on the court. \n\n\"The voters, however, rejected this vision of where the court ought to go,\" Malcolm told the Daily Signal. \n\nElizabeth Wydra of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center sees things differently. \n\n\"Given that most Americans support Roe v Wade, oppose flooding the political system with special interest cash, and believe in the values of equality and inclusion expressed in the Constitution, there is no reason to think they would support a Supreme Court nominee who would promote an extreme conservative agenda from the bench,\" she said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.43198084831238, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 785, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.69588710056, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170106120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.54777070063694, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/07/opinions/bystander-guide-may-stark-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "How to stand up against hate ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 915, "date": "20161207200000", "story_content": "When any part of our society gives license to bigotry, we must stand up to it. Decent people all around America have displayed a beautiful outpouring of desire to step up in unprecedented ways to support total strangers who are being actively targeted with hatred, violence, discrimination, and venom. \n\nBut the desire to help people from marginalized groups who face harassment or threat isn't enough. We have to act. Just recently, on a New York subway, a young Muslim woman was reportedly subjected to verbal and physical harassment by three men; according to police, the woman said these men grabbed at her and called her a \"terrorist\" who should \"get out of this country.\" Later, on Facebook, she lamented that \"so many individuals chose to be bystanders,\" rather than intervening or trying to help her. \n\nIt's not a matter of heroics. Following through as a helper isn't simple, and being an effective and active bystander doesn't mean swooping in and saving the day. Not only is this an ineffective model, it can also make things worse for the person being harassed, who now in addition to managing the person harassing them, may feel like they have to manage you too.\n\nThe key to successful bystander intervention is knowing that you have options and using them. At the anti-harassment organization Hollaback! we call them the 4 Ds of Bystander Intervention.\n\nFirst, distract. Creating a distraction can help de-escalate the situation by bringing the person doing the harassment \"out of the moment.\" Examples include asking for the time, dropping your coffee cup, pretending you're lost -- or really, anything. In a scene caught on video, a man witnessing a domestic dispute on the subway decided to walk between the couple while very slowly eating potato chips. It was such an odd scene that it distracted the couple long enough to break their immediate tension and inspired others to show up and intervene further.\n\nNext, delay. Intervention doesn't always need to happen while the harassment is happening. After the harassment is over, ask the person if they are OK, or if there is anything you can do to help. This one is powerful because it puts control of the situation back into the hands of the person being harassed. It makes them feel less alone, and reduces trauma. In one report submitted to Hollaback!, a man noticed harassment happening, but saw that the victim was already getting support and waited to see if more help was needed. When the incident was over, he told the victim he had been \"watching and would've intervened if the guy tried to touch [her].\" \n\nOr, you can delegate.  Ask for a third party to help, there is power in numbers. We've heard stories of people finding support in someone else standing near them, or from a transit employee, a teacher, or a manager. In Minneapolis, a bystander stood up for her friend who was being harassed at a bar by a man who had allegedly raped her in the past by reporting the guy to the bouncer.\n\nFinally, there is direct intervention. Calmly let the harasser know that what they are doing is wrong, but do not escalate the situation. The focus of this intervention is to usher the person being harassed to safety. This can be risky and is not always the safest bet for everyone as the harassment can be redirected at the bystander, but there are some people who can do this. For example, when a young man in Chicago overheard someone make a racist remark to a young black woman, he responded directly to the harasser by saying, \"I don't think she needs you telling her what she's supposed to say.\" \n\nBefore you decide what strategy to use, you need to trust your instincts and consider: what worries me about intervening in this situation? You may be scared it will escalate, you may be worried you'll say the wrong thing, or you may be confused about whether what you witnessed was harassment or not. Being honest with yourself here will help you identify what the right solution is for you. For example, if you are worried about escalation, try creating a distraction or asking the person if they are OK. If you're worried about saying the wrong thing, delegate the intervention to someone else. \n\nRemember that your goal is helping the target, not fighting the harasser. Cornell's International Labor Relations school conducted research and found that as little as a knowing glance shared with the target can reduce the trauma associated with harassment, while the presence of bystanders who do nothing can actually increase the trauma. \n\nAnd this is a problem. Too often we're in our own little worlds and we pass by these harassment incidents, doing nothing because we don't see them in the first place. Being a good bystander is predicated on actually seeing what's going on in the street and the subway. You can't intervene if you don't know what's going on around you, if you're not aware, not looking at the people around you. You can't be an active bystander if you don't notice what's going on. \n\nThis matters beyond moments of potential harm. Being aware, and acknowledging the people around you in public binds us together as communities. In a world upside down, we don't always know if we can trust the police and we don't always know if we can trust the government. We need to be able to count on each other.

Obama is fond of saying that only problems that no one else can solve reach the President's desk.\n\nHow Donald Trump won\n\nBut Trump is the only man ever to win the presidency with no political, diplomatic or military executive experience, so his learning curve to becoming the most powerful man in the world will be even steeper.\n\nTrump is no longer on the campaign trail and is not therefore subject to the same pressures that a candidate faces. So in a sense, the transition allows him to reset and at least attempt to adopt a more presidential posture.\n\nHis task will be exacerbated by the fact that he appears on track to lose the popular vote to Clinton, even though he won the electoral college -- a factor that undercuts any claims of a mandate.\n\nClinton's 2008 campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle, a CNN contributor, said Trump needs to make amends to Americans insulted by his conduct -- including African-Americans, women and Hispanics.\n\n\"I think he needs to start with an apology \u2014 honestly,\" she said on CNN's \"The Lead.\" Given the President-elect's reluctance to admit he is wrong, that step at least seems unlikely.\n\nTrump's new audience stretches beyond Washington and the United States. US allies were alarmed by Trump's victory, given his criticism of US alliances overseas and hazy knowledge of defense and nuclear doctrine.\n\nAdversaries like Russia and China will already be gaming out how best they can take advantage of their inexperienced new counterpart in Washington.\n\nHow Republicans scrambled to hold the Senate\n\nWhile Trump has the advantage of a ready-made domestic program given Republican control of Congress, he has no such luxury when it comes to national security policy.\n\nTrump's foreign policy team also lacks a diplomatic heavy hitter respected abroad: speculation is mounting that he will bring in someone who is a known quantity overseas as Secretary of State \u2014 someone like Sen. Bob Corker, who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nHe has just over two months to staff the State Department, Pentagon, his White House National Security staff, install new leadership at the Intelligence Agencies and begin to install top diplomatic envoys overseas.\n\nIt would be a daunting task for any president. Trump is further handicapped by the fact that a huge chunk of the Republican national security establishment, alarmed by his volatile temperament and rudimentary knowledge, defected en masse to Clinton.\n\nBut the most fundamental question facing Trump may be his own temperament.\n\nThe idea that the President-elect was too erratic and volatile to be commander-in-chief was at the center of Clinton's campaign, and many Americans and foreigners alike worry that his inauguration will usher in a period full of danger and risks.\n\nWho could be in the Trump administration?\n\nTrump showed at times on the campaign trail that he could be disciplined. Such a demeanor will be even more crucial now because a stray word from a president who can send financial markets tumbling or send foreign armies onto red alert.\n\nThe transition period will be a time for him to try on his new role as a statesman.\n\nThe question is whether he will be the version of Trump who vowed to throw Clinton in jail or someone with a personality more becoming of a commander in chief.\n\n\"Is this the Donald Trump who wanted to ban all Muslims coming into America?\" CNN contributor Matt Lewis, a conservative author, said on CNN Wednesday. \"Or is this the Donald Trump that sounded a much more conciliatory last night?\n\nHe added: \"I hope that he was sort of fronting a little bit to win the election and that he will actually govern in a more statesmanlike manner.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.20346331596375, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1068, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.6386356538499998, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161110120000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 3.2771535580524302, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/23/africa/nigeria-fake-plastic-rice/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 802, "scraper_regex": 875}}, "headline": "'Plastic' or not? Over 100 bags of fake rice seized in Nigeria", "wordcount_as_scraped": 875, "date": "20161223190000", "story_content": "Nigerian authorities have seized 2.5 metric tons of reportedly fake rice during the holiday season.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Nigerian Custom Service said it intercepted 102 bags of a brand called Best Tomato Rice after the recipient of a gift of rice alerted authorities. The health ministry released a statement on Friday urging Nigerians to remain calm after preliminary findings found no evidence that the rice was plastic or consisted of toxic chemical substances. Yet, the country's National Agency for Food Drug Administration Control has not released their investigative report.\n\nThe health minister's statement contradicts earlier reports from customs officials. \n\nMamudu Haruna, comptroller of the Federal Operations Unit, called it \"plastic\" rice at a press briefing in Lagos Thursday. \"We have done the preliminary analysis on the plastic rice. After boiling, it was sticky and only God knows what would have happened if people consumed it.\"\n\nHaruna described the importers of the fake rice as \"economy saboteurs\" seeking to capitalize off of Nigerians looking for bargains during the Christmas and New Year holiday season.\n\nIt is unclear where the shipment of rice originated. \"A consultant said he was given 221 bags to distribute,\" Jerry Attah, the public relations officer for the assistant superintendent of customs, told CNN. \n\nOne customer who avoided a potential mishap was Kikelomo Adediti. She said she bought 10 cups of the product (about 2 kg) from a small retailer in the Ikeja area of Lagos, in November.\n\n\"It looked perfectly normal and cost less [than regular rice] so I thought I got a great deal. Normally it would take about 20 minutes [to cook] but after 30 minutes it was still hard. I added more water and the aroma was chemical in nature so I decided to discard it thinking it had expired,\" she told CNN. Adediti didn't formally report the incident.\n\nIn another case, a woman who received rice as a gift noticed something was wrong after cooking it. Her husband then called customs officials. \n\nPlastic, resin or none of the above\n\nYet, it's still unclear what the rice is made of. \n\n\"If you look at it it's rice. If you look at the pictures it's rice. If you cook it and eat it it's rice. It's only when you touch it you'll feel it that you realize it's not,\"  Attah told CNN.\n\n\"That's why I call it fake rice, not plastic rice. To me it's more like flour coated in maybe rubber... I don't know the kind of formulations or chemicals they use,\" he said.\n\nAttah said that a total of 221 bags -- each weighing 25 kilos -- came into Nigeria, but only 102 were recovered, which means 119 have already been distributed. \n\nNigerians' love for rice\n\nRice is a major staple food in Nigeria and a favorite holiday meal, often prepared as jollof rice. \n\nIt is estimated that Nigerians consume 6 million metric tons of rice per year; in 2013, former minister of agriculture, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, said the country spends more than $1 billion annually to import rice.\n\n\"Though rice contribute a significant proportion of the food requirements of the [Nigerian] population, production capacity is far below the national requirements. In order to meet the increasing demand,  Nigeria has had to resort to importation of milled rice to bridge the gap between domestic demand and supply,\" according to Professor Tunji Akande, author of An overview of the Nigerian Rice Economy.\n\nForex woes\n\nWith imports adversely affected by the country's foreign exchange woes and the continued rise of the dollar against Nigeria's currency the Naira, the cost of rice has more than doubled. \n\nBags of rice were on sale for NGN22,000 in Bodija market Ibadan and other major Nigerian markets on Thursday, compared with about NGN10,000 a year ago.\n\nThe desire for cheaper rice makes Nigerians vulnerable to counterfeit foods industry: \"Rice is very expensive and people are looking for where to get it at cheaper rates. If a regular bag costs NGN17,000 but the plastic one is being sold for 9,000, many Nigerian families will buy it,\" said economics expert Lanre Adigun.\n\n\"This is further aided by the porous nature of Nigeria's borders. Since the Nigerian government had already banned rice importation into the country through the land borders, the commodity is still being smuggled into the country through the border with Benin Republic. You can go to any market and you will see all sorts of rice imported through the land borders,\" said Feyikemi Oladokun, a nutrition expert who works with the agriculture ministry in Kwara state. \n\nNot just Nigeria\n\nIn 2011, a Korean news report revealed some fake rice is produced from potatoes that are shaped as rice with the addition of industrial resin. Even when cooked, the report said the rice remained hard. \n\nDr. Victoria Feyikemi of Babcock University Hospital Ogun state, Nigeria, said the medical consequences of consuming such products can be severe because the fake rice has synthetic resin that is harmful to the body.\n\n\"When you eat three bowls of this rice, you are basically ingesting one vinyl bag and the toxicity and associated pathologies are numerous. We cannot afford to add plastic rice-associated medical emergencies to our numerous health challenges in Nigeria, remember we are still struggling with Lassa fever,\" she said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.64976954460144, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 802, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.31110955471, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161223190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.24688279301746, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/trump-immigration-religion/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1035, "scraper_regex": 1088}}, "headline": "Religious leaders condemn Trump's immigration order.

Condemning President Donald Trump's new executive order on immigration is now one of them. \n\nBut will the people in the pews heed their calls to action? \n\nSince the order was released on Friday, a growing chorus of top Christians, Muslims, Jews and leaders of other faiths have denounced it, calling it contrary to their spiritual traditions and the country's values.  \n\n\"This weekend proved to be a dark moment in U.S. history,\" Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago, a top ally of Pope Francis, said on Sunday, expressing a sentiment widely echoed in churches, synagogues and mosques. \"The world is watching as we abandon our commitments to American values.\" \n\nMeanwhile, nearly 18,500 people have signed a statement promoted by a coalition of evangelical groups pledging to welcome refugees and urging elected officials to assist them. \n\nSeparately, a letter to Congress and Trump from the Interfaith Immigration Coalition has more than 2,000 signatures, including from the heads of several Jewish organizations and Protestant denominations who collectively represent millions of Americans. \n\nOn Sunday, more than 500 Catholics celebrated Mass outside the White House, seeking to express solidarity with immigrants and refugees. \n\nEven Trump's childhood church has condemned the executive order. \n\nThe Rev. J. Herbert Nelson, the top official in the Presbyterian Church (USA), called Trump's order \"a miscarriage of justice.\" \n\n\"I urge the president and his administration to reverse this very harmful decision regarding refugees,\" Nelson said. \"Presbyterians are not afraid of this so-called terror threat. We are not afraid because we profess a faith in Jesus, who entered the world a refugee.\"\n\nAs a boy, Trump attended a Presbyterian church in Queens, New York, that is now part of the Presbyterian Church (USA). He still calls himself a Presbyterian, though he no longer regularly attends church services.  \n\nGood Samaritans?\n\nTrump's order bars Syrian refugees indefinitely, suspends all refugee admissions for 120 days, halts immigration from seven majority Muslim countries for three months and gives priority to \"religious minorities\" when applying for refugee status. \n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Trump said the order is not a \"Muslim ban,\" as many critics have dubbed it. \n\n\"This is not about religion -- this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order,\" Trump said.  \n\nIn an interview with the Christian Broadcast Network on Friday, Trump also said that Christian refugees had been \"horribly treated\" by the United States. \"So we are going to help them.\" \n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, however, since 2002 the United States admitted far more Christian than Muslim refugees.  \n\nIn any case, even many Christian leaders said they do not want their brethren to get special treatment, arguing that the Bible is rife with examples of one tribe -- or faith -- helping another. \n\nThe Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit author and editor at America magazine, cited the parable of the Good Samaritan. \n\n\"Refusing the one in need because you want to protect yourself, especially when the other is in desperate need and obvious danger, is not what Christianity is about,\" Martin said. \"It's about the opposite. It's about helping the stranger, even if it carries some risk.\"\n\nThe Rev. Jim Winkler, President and General Secretary of the National Council of the Churches of Christ, a partnership of some 38 U.S. churches and denominations, drew on the example of Christianity's Holy Family. \n\n\"By effectively preventing the entrance of refugees into this country, President Trump is establishing a policy that would have kept Joseph, Mary and Jesus from entering our nation,\" Winkler said. \n\nHIAS, a Jewish refugee resettlement group based in Maryland, published a letter signed by more than 1,700 rabbis urging the United States to remain a safe haven for thousands fleeing war, poverty and genocide. \n\n\"Jewish history bears witness to the critical choice facing our country: whether to rescue those in need or to construct barriers to keep them out,\" the rabbis said, adding that America has provided generations of Jewish families with opportunity and welcome. \n\n\"But we also know what it looks like for America to turn its back on refugees. We have seen xenophobia overwhelm our nation's capacity for compassion, and we have seen the doors slam shut in our greatest hours of need.\"\n\nOn Monday, meanwhile, Russell Moore, the top ethics and public policy official in the Southern Baptist Church, which has some 17 million members, released a letter that he will send to Trump and Vice President Michael Pence. \n\nMoore acknowledged concerns about admitting immigrants from trouble spots in the Middle East and Africa but said refugees are already stringently vetted and that his church -- and the country -- have long traditions of \"welcoming the stranger.\" \n\n\"As a nation, we must seek to resolve the tension created by these two values \u2014 compassion for the sojourner and the security of our citizens \u2014 in a way that upholds both values,\" Moore said. \n\nNot all Christian leaders have criticized Trump, however. \n\nFranklin Graham, the son of famed evangelical preacher Billy Graham, told The Huffington Post that it is \"not a biblical command for the country to let everyone in who wants to come.\" \n\nThe Rev. Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church of Dallas and a member of Trump's evangelical advisory board, said Christians are more persecuted than other faiths and should be given preferential treatment, as the president has pledged to do.   \n\nPulpit vs. pews\n\nThroughout the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump essentially went over the heads of many Christian leaders, winning a majority of white Catholics and 81% of white evangelicals, despite the objections of evangelicals like Moore and Catholics like Pope Francis.  \n\nSurveys show there's some chance he could do so again with the new immigration order. \n\nMore than half of white evangelical Protestants (54%) and white mainline Protestants (53%) would support a law barring Syrian refugees from entering the United States, according to a survey conducted last June by the Public Religion Research Institute. \n\nA majority of those same groups, as well as a slight majority of white Catholics (52%) also endorse a temporary ban on Muslims coming to the United States from abroad, the survey found. \n\nProtestant pastors, at least, are well aware of the pulpit-pew divide in their churches. While 86% agreed that Christians have a responsibility to care for refugees and foreigners, according to a survey by LifeWay Research, more than 4 in 10 say their congregations are fearful about refugees coming to the United States.

The fact that many people see this as a problem of Trump's own making means that the task will be even more complicated for him than it perhaps would have been for Hillary Clinton. \n\nAs president, Trump will quickly find his hands tied if he does not seek to reverse this downward spiral.\n\nThe tenor of the debate in the US has cast a shadow over the country, and that shadow is visible far beyond America's shores. This shadow is one marked by uncertainty and fear about the implications of a Trump presidency, especially in Europe and Asia. \n\nBut American values are reflected first and foremost through the lens of its domestic politics. Trump's embrace of torture tactics, his racist language and his sexism create mistrust among America's liberal allies and fear among allies that do not share a common culture with the United States. \n\nTrump also must reunite an American public that is deeply divided. If Trump fails to overcome these divisions, they are likely to take root and fester, with grave consequences for the future health of America and for the rest of the world.\n\nThe last 100 days have seen a campaign dominated by mudslinging, racism, sexist attacks, false allegations, attacks on individual characters and a willingness to \"go low.\" The willingness of Trump to abandon a basic sense of decency, decorum and dignity in public debate has undermined international confidence in the US.\n\nIn a world where power is more evenly distributed among a number of states -- and many leading powers do not embrace similar values to those of the US -- leadership that has the potential to unify will matter more, not less.   \n\nCandidates may not need allies, but presidents do. Moral authority and the liberal values that underpin it have always been an essential component of American leadership. And America's leadership has depended on the goodwill of its allies. The defection from liberal values, reflected in concrete policy proposals, makes this difficult. \n\nForeign publics have recoiled as a candidate for president has threatened to withdraw support from key allies in Europe and Asia, to rethink its support for NATO, and cozied up to Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhen both candidates embraced political platforms that were anti-free trade -- at a time when populism threatens the fabric of social life in many countries -- America's ambivalence will have generated fear among its partners.\n\nIn Asia, many nations have hung their hat on the hope that the US would deliver the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This now looks increasingly unlikely.\n\nFor European leaders -- whose post-war recoveries were built on the back of the Marshall Plan and who now face their own crises driven by problems in the euro zone, immigration, and the politics of Brexit -- the absence of American economic leadership leaves a gaping hole.\n\nAt a time when Europe is politically turning in on itself, tensions with Russia are high, and the US-China relationship calls for careful management, the leadership vacuum is palpable.\n\nIn the twilight of Obama's presidency we have witnessed a resurgent Russia that has violated human rights norms at home and sovereignty norms abroad. It continues to intimidate Baltic and Eastern Europe states. These countries are waiting to see if America will come to their defense. In Syria, Russia's active backing of Assad's attacks on innocent civilians is an even greater barrier to US-Russia relations and one that will be difficult for Mr. Trump to shy away from.\n\nIn Asia, we are seeing China assume a more confident role in dealing with previous US allies. Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte said on a recent visit to China: \"America has lost now. I've realigned myself in your ideological flow.\"\n\nEven North Korea is taking advantage of the current power vacuum. The next administration will not be able to ignore this threat for long, and absent cooperation from China, may not have many good options.  \n\nNowhere has America's role as a liberal leader been more symbolic than in its embrace of immigrants. That the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island continue to be two of the America's top tourist destinations stands in stark contrast to the attacks on immigration that have dominated recent electoral politics.\n\nThe 45th president of the United States will face a daunting, Janus-faced challenge -- to restore at home and lead abroad.  \n\nAmerican leadership has always been marked by hypocrisy, but Trump's public disavowal of the American commitment to the most basic liberal principles has threatened to undermine even the aspirations that the world has come to accept as fundamental to the liberal order.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.91705060005188, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 797, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 14, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.52175640562, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 45, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161109140000, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.090909090909999, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 10, "pct_mft_words": 5.64617314930991, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/18/opinions/elizabeth-warren-trump-stand-up-for-workers/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Elizabeth Warren: Trump, show us you'll stand up for workers", "wordcount_as_scraped": 675, "date": "20170118130000", "story_content": "Over the past eight years, President Barack Obama has advanced strong executive actions and federal rules that have provided millions of people with better wages, better benefits and stronger protections in the workplace. On Friday, a new president will move into the Oval Office. He will face a stark choice -- expand on those efforts or destroy them.\n\nDespite years of flat wages and exploding fixed costs such as housing, education and health care, Republicans in Congress have long refused even to consider legislation to create new economic opportunity for families. Initiatives such as raising the federal minimum wage and guaranteeing paid family leave for workers have languished despite bipartisan, state-level initiatives and broad support for these kinds of policies among Americans of both parties.  \n\nFaced with this dereliction of duty, Obama and his Labor Department have done what they can for workers. It hasn't been enough to shore up a crumbling middle class, but it's been a lot.\n\nThey acted to improve wages. By expanding overtime pay to more than 4 million Americans, the new labor rules would put as much as $1.3 billion a year in the pockets of workers. They bumped up the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 an hour, providing an estimated 200,000 low-wage workers with a raise. \n\nThey required government contractors to provide workers with up to seven paid sick days per year, which increased this emergency time-off option for more than 1 million workers. They prohibited federal contractors from denying jobs to otherwise qualified workers based on gender identity or sexual orientation and expanded equality in the workplace. They even finalized a long-delayed rule to protect workers exposed to silica dust from contracting horrible diseases such as silicosis, lung disease and cancer. These and other actions over the last several years have made a big difference to families across this country.\n\nEvery one of these rules could have been passed by Congress, but because Republicans refused to help, they were accomplished instead by rule making and executive orders. This left industry advocates free to challenge the new provisions in court.  \n\nToday, many of these initiatives are in jeopardy. A federal judge in Texas recently issued a decision at least temporarily blocking new overtime pay requirements for millions of workers -- a legal fight that will drag into the new administration.  In fact, every single one of these requirements to help workers could be reversed by the new President.\n\nPaid sick days, a higher minimum wage and discrimination-free hiring for federal contractor employees? Gone. Protections from dying of dangerous silica exposure on the job? Out the window. Getting paid for overtime for the hours you actually work? Promises turned to dust.\n\nDonald Trump doesn't need to reverse these gains. After all, he won the presidency while arguing that he would stand up for workers and promising millions of \"high-paying jobs\" for working-class Americans. But now he's pulling a fast reversal. The President-elect has already promised to \"cancel immediately,\" \"eliminate\" or \"repeal\" Obama's executive orders and agency regulations. If he follows through on that promise, many of these worker benefits will be obliterated. \n\nThe political campaign is over, and Trump is poised to assume the presidency. When it comes to the economic futures of millions of working families, the stakes could not be higher. Americans will judge the President-elect not by his past promises but by his future actions.\n\nThere are Americans busting their tails working full-time jobs and still living in poverty, Americans who log massive hours and depend on overtime payments to put food on the table, Americans who can't take a day off to care for a sick child without getting fired, Americans who've been denied good jobs because of who they are or who they love, Americans who've watched co-workers die horrific deaths from silica exposure.\n\nNow it's time for Donald Trump to show his true colors.

Or will he toss them overboard and cozy up with corporate CEOs and congressional Republicans who are peddling the same tired old anti-worker plans?", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.14637494087219, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 654, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 5, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.38452309975, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.9755351681957203, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/09/politics/government-shutdown/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 642, "scraper_regex": 1139}}, "headline": "Government stays open, funding bill clears key hurdle in Senate", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1139, "date": "20161209190000", "story_content": "The Senate late Friday cleared a bill to fund the government through the end of April, narrowly averting a shutdown.\n\nThe 63-36 vote came just before a midnight deadline when the government could have run out of money.  \n\nFinal passage came after a procedural vote to advance the measure was narrowly adopted. Needing 60 votes, it cleared 61-38. The vote took nearly an hour and was tense and uncertain to the end as senators weighed political and parochial interests in deciding which way to vote.  Party leaders and whips, trying to save the must-pass bill, worked their members furiously. President Barack Obama signed the measure into law early Saturday.\n\nThe late night action came after a day of back-channel negotiations aimed at alleviating concerns from coal-state Democrats who wanted a longer extension of expiring health benefits for retired coal miners. Democrats failed to secure enough votes to that extension. \n\nThe battle centered on how long the government should extend health benefits for retired coal miners, as the Democrats called for an extension lasting one year, rather than the four months in the current proposal. And it amounted to the most intense partisan squabble on Capitol Hill since the general election, where Democrats struggled to win over white, working-class voters.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who faces reelection in 2018 and is under consideration for a job in Donald Trump's administration, took to the Senate floor Friday evening and demanded that his colleagues block the funding bill, which is needed to keep the government open past midnight.\n\n\"We've been working and fighting and really clawing for this,\" Manchin said. \"But we've got some friends on the other side who believed it wasn't an emergency.\" Still, Democrats privately and publicly conceded they were unlikely to win over the 41 votes needed to shut the government down. \n\n\"I don't think we are going to get to the 41,\" Manchin said at a news conference Friday evening.\n\nWhat Democrats got from the exercise is unclear. Democrats contended they had elevated the issue, and hoped that their aggressive push would pressure top Republicans to cut a deal on a permanent solution early next year. But they did not get the legislative fix they had been demanding.\n\nDuring a caucus meeting Thursday, Senate Democratic leaders and coal-state Democrats agreed to use a threat of a shutdown to bring attention to the issue and push for a longer extension in January, a senior Democratic aide said.\n\n\"Our intention was never, never, ever to shut this place down,\" Manchin told CNN.\n\nAdded Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia: \"We're not going to shut down the government on this issue.\"\n\nThe late-evening developments come as Senate Republicans and Democrats engaged in behind the scenes negotiations to try to head off a shutdown at midnight.\n\n\"I'm hopeful we'll wrap it up this evening but I don't have anything to announce yet,\" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second ranking Senate Republican, told reporters.\n\nIn a sign of possible progress that a disruption to government services could be averted, Cornyn said discussions were underway between GOP leaders and Manchin of West Virginia, the lead Democrat pressing for changes to the health insurance program.\n\n\"We're working through third parties. Third party negotiators,\" Cornyn said. \"I haven't talked to him directly but there are conversations taking place between leadership on the Democratic side and this side.\"\n\nRepublicans argued McConnell, who represents miner interests in his home state of Kentucky, has already committed to work to extend the health insurance for a full year, which is the central demand of Manchin and the Democrats backing his effort. Republicans note that McConnell initially pushed to get a one year extension into the funding bill and has spoken on the floor about his desire to extend it that long. \n\nSen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, one of the leaders of the effort, told CNN that the GOP would squarely to be blame if there were a shutdown. Asked if he had the support to block a bill, Brown said: \"I don't have any idea what we have. I know that the support has been stronger than I expected from Democrats and from some Republicans that will vote with us.\"\n\nAt issue is whether to extend the miners' insurance program -- which serves retired miners and their spouses -- for one year or for just for the four month length of the GOP-authored spending bill, which is known as a continuing resolution or CR. \n\nOne person who is trying to build support for the measure is Manchin who was holed up in his office Friday talking to Democrats and some Republicans urging them to block the CR. Manchin, a moderate, had been scheduled to meet with Trump in New York Friday about a possible job in his administration but it was postponed until Monday so he could deal with the miners' issue. \n\nDemocrats are worried Manchin might leave the Senate to work for Trump, which could lead to a Republican pick up of his Senate seat. \n\nManchin is leading a pack of coal Senate Democrats -- including Brown, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania,  each of whom is up for re-election in two years --- to bolster the insurance benefits. Manchin has the support of at least one Republican, his fellow West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, while GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio is weighing whether to join the Democrats as well.\n\nBut even Manchin wouldn't predict that he has the 41 votes needed to scuttle the spending bill and force a change to help the miners.\n\n\"We have a strong commitment from our caucus, I can tell you that. Very strong,\" is as far as Manchin would go when asked specifically late Thursday if he had 41 votes. \n\nOne key Democrat has joined Manchin's battle. Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York vowed Thursday, \"We are going to win this fight.\"\n\nThere could be political dividends for Democrats making a full-throated fight for the miners, even at the risk of a potentially risky shutdown. Trump won big in coal country and Democrats would love to claw back some of those working class voters. \n\nAs he opened the chamber for what's been expected to be the final legislative day of the year, McConnell implored Democrats to accept the miners provision as it is and not recklessly shutdown the government over it.\n\n\"It's been my intention that the miner benefits not expire at the end of April next year,\" said McConnell.  I'm going to work with my colleagues to prevent that.  But this is a good time to take 'yes' for an answer.  We should pass the CR without delay.\"\n\nMcConnell noted that the bill passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support Thursday, a sign House Democrats were okay with the four month extension.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.44300138950348, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 642, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.6006197147, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.1806853582554497, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/30/world/greek-ambassador-brazil-killed-widow/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e7": [694, 1616]}}, "headline": "Greek ambassador to Brazil killed by wife's lover, police say", "wordcount_as_scraped": 541, "date": "20161231080000", "story_content": "Police contend Greece's ambassador to Brazil was killed by his wife's lover -- a military police officer -- and the widow is being questioned in the crime, Brazil's state-run Agencia Brasil news agency reported Saturday.\n\nChief Evaristo Pontes, a police investigator in the Baixada Fluminense region, said Friday that Sergio Gomes Moreira Filho claimed he killed the ambassador in self-defense and then recruited his cousin to help dispose of the body, Agencia Brasil News reported. \n\nAmbassador Kyriakos Amiridis, 59, had been missing since Monday, Pontes said.

But political in the sense of plain and simple revenge.\n\nEleanor, we'll call her (though she'd recently retired, she could clearly still feel the hot breath of potential revenge on her own neck) expressed her sadness that the French system had become so very much different from the American. \n\nEach French president, when he assumed office, would all but automatically appoint a new head of the RG of his own political party who would in turn, reflexively open a detailed investigation of the entourage of his predecessor, leading often to indictments, or at least hauling individuals in for extended interrogation and endless media attention.\n\nThis happened in 2012 when the newly-elected Socialist President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande sacked Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pech\u00e9nard, head of the national police force; Michel Gaudin, the Paris police chief, and Bernard Squarcini, director of the RG.\n\nEach had committed the paramount sin of close loyalty to defeated President Nicolas Sarkozy. Indeed, Squarcini himself almost immediately came under investigation for having used the security services to trace press leaks damaging to Sarkozy. \n\nAlmost immediately, probes were opened into the campaign finances of Sarkozy and his party leaders. Today, as France readies for its next election in May, Sarkozy is still being hauled in for interrogation on use of campaign funds in his failed 2012 campaign.\n\nSomehow, this has come to be almost expected in France. Let's hope the United States doesn't follow France's unseemly example. America is, or should be, better than this. Because France is a cardinal example of the dangers of politicizing law enforcement. Such an image of French investigators has led to deep suspicion of all French law enforcement, especially within the nation's vast, heavily Arab, immigrant communities that have proved so hospitable to terrorist bombers and led authorities to spend months trying to locate suspects whose names had long been known to them.\n\nAs it happens, operations of neither the FBI nor the Justice Department are guaranteed by the US Constitution. They are creatures of the executive branch, established by acts of Congress, whose independence is guaranteed only by statute, precedent and an indelible sense of the special role each plays in how democracy should operate in America.\n\nSo when former House Speaker Newt Gingrich tweets: \"If @HillaryClinton is elected, the criminal investigations will be endless,\" and when Donald Trump proclaims after the FBI had cleared Clinton a second time, \"Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it,\"adding \"she will be under investigation for a long, long time, likely concluding in a criminal trial,\" the entire American justice system risks turning into a revolving door reflection of the dysfunctional and deeply politicized French system.\n\nIf @HillaryClinton is elected, the criminal investigations will be endless. https://t.co/cWoCXCVfSZ pic.twitter.com/rlg1BCqG1i\u2014 Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) November 7, 2016\n\nThe United States has long served as a model for the special kind of role that democracy plays at every level of society -- the very reason that Congress, itself today so deeply divided, gave the FBI director a 10-year term that can, and often has, transcended political changes in the Oval Office.\n\nAny lack of confidence in this system and its most sensitive and powerful institutions sends a message to the rest of the world that the United States is no longer a shining beacon of fairness and justice. It also sends a message to Americans: that such behavior is entirely acceptable, that justice is effectively for sale and that the victor has every right to his, or her, pound of flesh.\n\nEleanor's parting words were that she hoped fervently the United States was not headed in the same direction. I would have to agree with her. The winner in our presidential sweepstakes must embrace both the ideal and the individuals who will enforce these ideals.\n\nShould she win, Hillary Clinton must embrace James Comey and accept that the FBI is indeed an organization whose independence is worth preserving at all cost. She must choose an attorney general prepared to accept such a view as well. If he wins, Donald Trump must accept that he has been elected president of all the people and that revenge is not an appropriate attribute for any American leader.\n\nIndeed, all those in power must understand the responsibility that accompanies it. Even a deeply divided Congress must resist the urge to purge. And if there were any doubt as to how critical that is to the political future of even the most self-serving legislator, the latest poll in France shows the popularity of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande hovering at just 4 percent.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.4877789020538301, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 870, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.98757758639, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161107180000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.44827586206897, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/22/europe/berlin-attack-anis-amri-manhunt-germany/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 575, "scraper_regex": 801}}, "headline": "Berlin attack: Fingerprints link manhunt suspect to truck", "wordcount_as_scraped": 801, "date": "20161222170000", "story_content": "It's looking increasingly likely that the main suspect in the Berlin Christmas market attack, Anis Amri, was the attacker, Germany's interior minister said Thursday.\n\nHis fingerprints were found in the cabin of the truck that plowed into the market Monday, leaving 12 people dead and 48 injured, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told a news conference.\n\n\"There are additional indications which support this,\" he said. \"This is why it's so important that the manhunt is successful.\"\n\nA massive search is underway for Amri, 24, who is considered violent and believed to be armed.\n\nA European arrest warrant was issued for Amri, and authorities offered a reward of up to 100,000 euros (about $104,000) for information on his whereabouts.\n\nElaborating about the investigation hours after de Maiziere spoke, a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor's office said authorities also found fingerprints \"outside of the door of the truck, and inside.\"\n\n\"Our investigation makes us assume that Anis Amri did drive the truck,\" the spokeswoman, Frauke Koehler, told reporters Thursday evening. \n\nGerman police carried out raids in cities across the country Thursday, including at a refugee shelter in Emmerich, in North Rhine-Westphalia, where Amri is believed to have stayed. \n\nMeanwhile, newly released dashcam footage showed the truck speeding through an intersection towards the Christmas market, seconds before it crashed into the crowd. \n\nThe video is the first released so far showing the truck at the moment of impact. \n\nISIS network\n\nAccording to German investigative files obtained by CNN on Thursday, Amri had ties to an ISIS recruitment network in Germany and had previously discussed launching an attack there.\n\nAmri and several members of the so-called Abu Walaa network backpacked more than 10 miles in Germany to get into shape as they prepared to travel to join ISIS, a police informant inside the network told investigators, according to investigative files obtained by CNN. \n\nThat December 23, 2015, training session and others were led by Boban Simeonovic, a leading German-Serbian figure in the network, according to the informant.\n\nIn late 2015 and early 2016, Simeonovic personally tried through his contacts at a mosque in the northern German town of Hildesheim to arrange logistics for Amri to leave the country, according to the files. \n\nAmri communicated with the radical circle in Germany using the encryption app Telegram, a police informant inside the group told investigators, according to the investigative file obtained by CNN.\n\n4 arrested in November\n\nThe main figure in the network, Ahmad Abdulaziz Abdullah -- a 32-year-old Iraqi national also known as Abu Walaa -- and four others were arrested and charged with terrorism offenses in November.\n\nRalf Jaeger, interior minister of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, said Wednesday that he could not confirm a link to Abu Walaa.\n\nAmri was particularly close to Simeonovic, who was also charged in December, a German intelligence official told CNN. \n\nAmri is mentioned several times by name in the 345-page investigative file, which underpinned the case built by prosecutors.\n\n\"Anis spoke several times about committing attacks,\" a police informant told German investigators, according to the files.

Getting rid of free trade between the countries would hurt the Mexican auto industry in two ways: by raising the cost of vehicles exported to the US and, if imported supplies are taxed, by raising the cost of production for Mexico.\n\nAccording to the Office of the US Trade Representative, US goods imported from Mexico totaled $295 billion in 2015, up 638% from 1993 (pre-NAFTA).\n\nOil sales\n\nOil is the backbone of the Mexican economy, and a lot of it is sold to the US.\n\nCrude petroleum oil has been one of the leading US import items from Mexico by a wide margin, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\n\nThe US purchased $27.7 billion of it in 2014 -- nearly 30 percent more than the next leading item.\n\nIf the US Treasury Department were to slap a tariff on oil or put some sort of sanction on Mexico, it would likely significantly impact the Mexican economy (though it would also affect US businesses that purchase oil from Mexico.)\n\nRemittances and visas\n\nMexicans abroad, mainly in the US, sent nearly $25 billion in 2015 to their relatives and loved ones back home, Mexico's Central Bank reported in early February -- the first time remittances were the most important source of revenue for Mexico since officials started tracking the figure in 1995.\n\nThat money is a lifeline for many poor Mexicans, especially when the economy is struggling.\n\nTrump threatens Mexico's biggest cash source\n\nThe Trump administration could make it much harder for Mexicans or Americans in the US to send cash to the country by blocking remittances -- an idea he floated on the campaign trail in a letter to The Washington Post.\n\nIn November, remittances to Mexico totalled nearly $2.4bn, a 25% jump over the previous year https://t.co/tmpSMGfhzA\u2014 The Economist (@TheEconomist) January 25, 2017\n\nIn the same letter, the Trump campaign also threatened to cancel visas and raise visa fees as means to either fund the wall or get Mexico to pay for it. \n\nSecurity cooperation\n\nThe Trump administration could threaten to pull out of security agreements with Mexico that help the country in its war on organized crime and the drug trade.\n\nThe US provided $139 million to Mexico for security assistance in the 2016 fiscal year -- and some $2.6 billion from 2008 to 2016 -- according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. \n\nBut pulling assistance could backfire. If the violence and drug cartels become more powerful, the effects could spill over into the United States. \n\nForeign Minister Videgaray has laid out a 10-point strategy plan for its relationship with the United States this week, emphasizing human rights, free trade and immigration. \n\n\"I think it is a win-win situation. (Trump) needs to see that. It is something that, well, the reality from Washington to the border is completely different,\" said Sen. Gabriela Cuevas Barron, head of Mexico's Foreign Affairs committee. \"(Trump) needs to understand the border and the bi-national families, industries, business. There is a different reality that Trump and his team need to see.\"\n\nTime to stand firm?\n\nSome senators say it's time for Mexico to stand firm and will doubtless be pleased that Pe\u00f1a Nieto canceled his meetings with Trump. \n\n\"We don't accept any aggressions. We are a country that must be treated as equals, even though we have a lot of asymmetries. We have been friends. We have been commercial associates. We are two countries that continue to share a prosperous future,\" Sen. Armando Rios Piter told CNN. \n\nPrior to Pe\u00f1a Nieto canceling the meetings, Sen. Roberto Gil Zuarth, from Mexico's National Action Party, tweeted, \"Given the announcement on the wall, the visit of the Mexican delegation today only makes sense to warn that there will be no meeting.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.389105051755905, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 944, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.3673198504500004, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.96610169491525, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/asia/ambassador-north-korea-defector-interview/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 724, "scraper_regex": 838}}, "headline": "Kim Jong Un wants to meet Trump, will never give up nukes, says defector", "wordcount_as_scraped": 838, "date": "20170125100000", "story_content": "The only way to change North Korea's destiny is to change its leader, says the most senior North Korean diplomat to defect in almost 20 years.\n\nThae Yong Ho was number two in the North Korean embassy in London before he escaped with his wife and two sons, arriving in South Korea in August.\n\n\"As long as Kim Jong Un is in power, there'll be no chance for the world to improve the human rights issue\" or cancel \"the nuclear program,\" he says.\n\nThae's initial hopes that Kim's youth and overseas studies would make him a reformer were soon destroyed as he saw more and more of his fellow high-ranking officials being executed, almost, he says, on a whim.\n\n\"If Kim Jong Un decides to kill someone, if he thinks that he is a threat or he scared him, he just wants to get rid of him, that is the present reality of North Korea,\" he says, adding that he knows more elites will defect.\n\nA South Korean think-tank affiliated with the country's intelligence agency (INSS) assesses at least 340 people have been ordered to be executed since Kim took power in December 2011.\n\nRELATED: What North Korean defections mean\n\nTalking to Trump\n\nThae says after his initial surprise that President Donald Trump won the US election, Kim now sees it as \"a good opportunity for him to open a kind of compromise with the new American administration.\"\n\nBut Thae insists Kim will only talk on his terms, pointing to the leader's New Year's Address.\n\n\"The level of this New Year's speech is almost blunt blackmail,\" says Thae.\n\nIn the address, Kim made it clear that if the US continued its current policy against North Korea, he would continue to add nuclear weapons to the country's military capability.\n\n\"He called it pre-emptive strike capability,\" says Thae. \"That is ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missiles].\"\n\nRELATED: Kim Jong Un says North Korea close to testing ICBM\n\nDuring his campaign, President Trump said he would be open to meeting Kim.

He says it needs to prevent natural resources being smuggled across the border from North Korea for cash, and also has to take North Korea's nuclear program more seriously.\n\nThae even goes one step further -- saying that nuclear weapons aren't only a threat to the US and South Korea.\n\n\"According to international geopolitics there is no eternal enemy or friend... nobody can predict if one day Kim Jong Un may want to blackmail China,\" he says.\n\nCutting off the 'slavery chain'\n\nWhen asked about relatives back in North Korea, Thae's voice drops.\n\nHe admits they may be sent to prison camps as punishment for his defection, or may even be used by the regime against him.\n\nHe knows he was extremely lucky to have his wife and both children with him in London, and that it's unlikely to happen to any other diplomat again.\n\nHe says North Korean diplomats will stay because their children are back in Pyongyang.\n\n\"The children are used by Kim Jong Un as kind of hostage,\" he says. \"Kim Jong Un abuses even the love between parents and children.\"\n\nWhen he finally told his wife and son of his intention to lead them all to safety, he says they were \"very grateful.\"\n\nHe says he could not miss the opportunity to \"cut off this slavery chain\" for his sons, knowing they would never have forgiven him if, in the future, they knew he had not taken the chance for their freedom.\n\nRELATED: North Korea says diplomat who defected is a 'criminal'\n\nBut defection is bittersweet for Thae Yong Ho.\n\n\"It made my life very miserable because I spent 50 years of my life on the wrong side, and I have to deny my past.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.1303257942199703, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 724, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.32840881361, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.31491712707182, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/21/middleeast/syria-russia-chechen-war/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 580, "scraper_regex": 622}}, "headline": "Ambassador shooting highlights Russia's long fight with Islamic radicals", "wordcount_as_scraped": 622, "date": "20161221080000", "story_content": "For Russia, the assassination of its ambassador in Turkey may only be the beginning of a new chapter in a long, gloomy book.\n\nHe shouted his support for the traumatized people of Aleppo, but exactly who the killer represented is still unknown -- or if he simply acted on his own.  \n\nGhastly, theatrical and public, the murder of Andrey Karlov at an Ankara art gallery -- videoed in minute and painful detail -- marks perhaps the latest episode in Russia's long fight with Islamic radicalism, or, from the opposing point of view, those who seek retribution for what they see as Russian \"war crimes\" in the past decades.\n\nIt stretches back well past the last decade, and the more recent example of the Metrojet liner blown out of the sky -- apparently by ISIS -- on its way from Sharm el-Sheikh, killing all 224 on board including 219 Russians.\n\nEchoes of Chechen conflict\n\nThe Moscow Nord Ost theatre siege of 2002, the horrific Beslan school massacre of 2004, the countless suicide bombings at rock concerts or metro stations -- all sought partial justification for their violence in the carnage of the Russian war in Chechnya, and the continuing bloody repression of the republic.\n\nThe Russian actions in Aleppo -- replete with accusations of carpet bombings, and the use of cluster munitions -- mirror the effect of its previous wars elsewhere, again returning it to the place of the jihadist's favored target. If we recall, Osama Bin Laden went to Afghanistan to fight the Soviet presence there, and so began al Qaeda. \n\nThousands of the more hardened fighters in ISIS and other jihadi groups in Syria and Iraq are from the former Soviet Union -- specifically Chechnya. The former, and now deceased, head of military operations in ISIS -- Omar al-Shishani -- was partly Chechen.\n\nMilitants may be aligned with ISIS\n\nRussia's wars in Chechnya are far from finished. The latest one, ending in 2001, was followed by a lengthy campaign of \"zachistki,\" or clean-up operations, in which military aged males were -- multiple investigations and organizations have alleged -- simply rounded up and executed. The European Court of Human Rights has said that \"...no explanation has been forthcoming from the Russian Government...\"\n\nFor a while it worked, and the installation of a Chechen strongman, Ramzan Kadyrov, led to the totalitarian suppression of a lot of the militancy. Yet the fight persisted.\n\nMany of the militants that now routinely attack Russian government facilities in southern Russia may have pledged allegiance to ISIS. \n\nEven this weekend, remarkable footage emerged of a policeman opening fire in the central streets of Grozny, the Chechen capital, during a substantial attack that left seven militants and possibly three policemen dead.\n\nRussia's aims in Syria\n\nOne Russian newspaper suggested it was an early sign of an uprising against the Russian-backed government there.\n\nRussia's actions in Syria serve two purposes. \n\nFirst, President Putin has exploited a gap in US interventionism to reinvigorate Russia's standing as a decision maker in the Middle East -- brutal as their actions have been. \n\nBut secondly, Moscow may also be seeking to tackle overseas those jihadists it has unwillingly exported to Syria and Iraq. Better hit them over there, than wait for them to trickle home.\n\nThat policy may not prove as successful as they would like, and the shocking images of suffering caused by their attacks around Aleppo, and on the pulverized rebel-held East of the city, may instead cause repeats of the disturbing Ankara murder. \n\nRussia does -- many UN officials now openly speculate - perhaps intend to continue using its military muscle in Syria to push to the north west and tackle the jihadist and rebel presence in Idlib. \n\nMany civilians who have already fled their actions in Aleppo will find themselves caught in that possible future battle.

At least this is certainly the sense one gets behind closed doors in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. \n\nThis is ironic, because possibly no other US President enjoyed as much cheering -- and a genuine willingness to work with him -- than Barack Obama received from the GCC when he was first elected in 2008. \n\nBut that was then. The situation, regretfully, couldn't be more different now.\n\nThe Arab grievances are many, and Obama has nobody to blame but himself. Indeed, after setting expectations so high during his famous 2009 Cairo speech, he leaves the region in a worse situation than the one he inherited.\n\nDespite his best efforts, he failed to deliver on the Israel-Palestine peace process. His promise to retract a US military presence from the region may have won him a Nobel Peace Prize, but it has certainly left Libya and Iraq in pieces.  \n\nHowever, for the Gulf states there are two issues that rise above the rest in terms of bitterness with the current administration: the infamous Obama U-turn on the red line he imposed on US intervention in Syria if its regime used chemical weapons against its people, and the controversial Iran nuclear deal. \n\nIn both cases, the GCC argument is that the current administration's actions only encouraged further turmoil in the region.\n\nYes, President Obama might claim that he managed, without firing a single bullet, to rid the Assad regime of their chemical arsenal and similarly halt Tehran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nBut the truth on the ground is that the killing has continued in Syria, where the death toll has risen above 400,000 since 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran has continued funding groups designated as terrorist organizations, dashing hopes that the deal would lead it to mitigate its behavior.\n\nIndeed, as Tehran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif was signing off the treaty, which was meant to promote peace, Iranian generals were bragging about a new empire and having four Arab cities under their occupation.\n\nToday, Iran is one of only two countries in the world that back Assad's massacres in Syria. It also continues to officially support Lebanon's Hezbollah (which is designated by the US as a terrorist group) and the Houthi militia that has overthrown a legitimate UN-backed government in Yemen and continues to harbor and support al-Qaeda terrorists within its borders, according to US government findings.  \n\nSo what could President-elect Trump do differently? \n\nWell, one thing to remember is that no sane person would ever argue against the fact that a nuclear-free Iran is certainly better for global and regional security. \n\nThe dispute with the Obama administration was over how the deal was reached since it didn't take into consideration Iran's rogue activities in the region, which are only set to further increase with the newly injected cash it will get.\n\nAs such, Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal's recent comments regarding the Iran nuclear deal make much sense.  \n\n\"I don't think he should scrap it (the nuclear deal). It's been worked on for many years and the general consensus in the world, not just the United States, is that it has achieved an objective, which is a 15-year hiatus in the program that Iran embarked on to develop nuclear weapons,\" said the prince, who is a former Saudi intelligence chief and ex-ambassador to Washington and London.\n\nBut Prince Turki said Trump should admonish Iran for its \"very adventurous and very destabilizing activities\" in the Middle East.\n\nAnd Iran isn't the only item on the table. Saudi Arabia in particular is expected to pursue intensive diplomatic efforts to rectify a serious glitch in its relationship with Washington: the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA.\n\nIndeed, while JASTA was conceived for a good cause, it ended up being directed totally against a country blamed indirectly for the atrocious 9/11 terror attacks, despite the recent release of a declassified report that failed to conclusively prove Saudi government involvement.\n\nRiyadh believes that blaming its government for acts of some misguided, evil individuals is the equivalent of blaming the US government, or all Americans, for the acts of someone like Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.      \n\nFurthermore, JASTA doesn't do justice to the serious efforts and sacrifices that Riyadh has made in combating global terrorism.\n\nThe new US administration should remember that despite all differences with the Gulf states and with Saudi Arabia in particular, President Obama actually opposed and vetoed JASTA. One can't assume that Obama only objected because he genuinely believed JASTA actually harms American interests, which it does.\n\nFinally, for President-elect Trump to be successful in the region, he must choose his words more carefully and remember that the campaigning period is over now. No Gulf country will support any discrimination or racism against Arabs or Muslims.\n\nHowever, if Trump is serious about combating violent extremism and taking on terrorists, he will have no better partner -- militarily, financially and ideologically -- than the GCC states. What better partner will there be for the new US administration than Saudi Arabia, a regional superpower that has actually formed and actively leads the Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism?\n\nDue to an editing error, a previous version of this article referred to Persian Gulf rather than Gulf states.

But then the conversation turned to the importance of likes and the fear of missing out, also known by the acronym FOMO.\n\nSadie, a 10th-grader in Brooklyn, New York, said she'd never heard the acronym before but is definitely familiar with the feeling.\n\n\"You see on, I guess you could say, Facebook or even Snapchat ... you see your friends hanging out with other people, and you're like 'Oh, I'm alone right now,' \" she said. \"And even if there's no way you could get to them even if you wanted to, it still just makes you feel bad or lonely or sad.\"\n\nThe upside of selfies: Social media not all bad for kids \n\nOlivia, 12, said she sometimes feels that way, too. \"If there's an event that maybe I'm not at or my friends are hanging out with each other ... sometimes I kind of feel, I guess, kind of left out.\"\n\nThe quest for the '100 club'\n\nThe teens and tweens also agreed there is a constant -- and at times anxiety-inducing -- fixation with likes. \n\n\"People will be like, 'Oh, are you in the 100 club?' \" Sadie said of getting 100 or more likes for a post. \n\nThe 15-year-old told the story of a friend who changed her profile picture and didn't get the 200 likes she normally gets on the first night whenever she makes such a change.\n\n\"She was freaking out,\" she said.\n\nThe more likes, the greater the social standing you appear to have, the girls said.\n\n\"People feel that when they get a lot of likes. It means that they're pretty and popular, and that makes them feel better,\" Sadie said.\n\nSaid Olivia, \"I really do notice that a lot of people who get tons of likes and have tons of followers on Instagram and Facebook do tend to think that they are really popular and that everyone knows who they are, when ... all their followers haven't even met them before.\" \n\nLikes translate into validation and attention, said Diana Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital literacy site for parents, educators, and tweens and teens. Graber also teaches \"cybercivics\" to middle-schoolers in Aliso Viejo, California.\n\nWhen she overhears conversations of students, she says, she very often hears things like, \"Check this out; I have this many likes.\" \n\n\"It's almost like a little competition for the number of likes,\" Graber said. \"I think that's anxiety-ridden, because you get likes based on how many friends you have, and you have to keep posting things to get more friends and it's like a vicious circle.\"\n\nGraber says this phenomenon was illustrated by a recent assignment in her classroom. She asked her students to try to go 24 hours without social media during one of three weekends.\n\nOf the 28 students, only one was able to do it. The teens couldn't stand not knowing what their friends were doing, Graber said.\n\n\"It was very hard. I kept getting tempted by my phone and my friends,\" wrote one student, who said he could last only five hours in his social-media-free zone.\n\nResearch: Social media can make you feel sad \n\nStudies show that social media can actually make you feel bad about yourself. According to a study last year by the University of Michigan, the more people checked Facebook, the worse they felt about their lives.\n\nAnother study, this one by German researchers, found that a third of people felt worse after spending time on Facebook, especially if they spent time viewing vacation photographs.\n\nHelping students realize the impact of social media on them was a big goal of the summer workshop held by SheKnows.com. That workshop also served as a pilot for a program called Hatch, which was just launched by the company.\n\nAs part of the new effort, kids ages 9 to 16 create videos for adults, said Samantha Skey, SheKnows.com's chief revenue officer. The informal tag line for the program is \"content for grown-ups made by kids on a mission,\" she said.\n\n\"It's content by kids, but it's really meant to address topics of interest to their parents in many cases,\" she said. \"The mission component is focused on teaching them digital literacy and citizenship while also allowing them to play with digital storytelling.\"\n\nReese, an 11th-grader in Los Angeles who participated in the Hatch pilot program, said she didn't really give much thought to the notion that digital media can impact people emotionally until there was a discussion about its psychological effect.\n\n\"And I found out that I am kind of neurotic about some things,\" she said. \"For example, when I text someone and I think that I might have made them upset because they didn't reply right away, I automatically assume that they got mad at me.\"\n\nTo prevent that from happening, she admits closing nearly all texts with a smiley, exclamation point or LOL.\n\nSadie, who also participated in the Hatch pilot, says she now looks at Snapchat and Facebook a bit differently.\n\n\"I know (they) can also have a negative psychological effect that I feel like didn't occur to me as much,\" she said.\n\nStarting conversations early \n\nThe takeaway from the workshop, said Skey, was that there is a \"huge opportunity\" to talk with teens about social media. \"A lot of them say that educators are not talking to them about media and social media unless they're telling them not to do something.\"\n\nTalking about social media early and often is key, says Graber, who did a demonstration this month for principals and other educators from across the state of California on how she teaches digital literacy and citizenship to teens.\n\n\"I always say to parents: It's not one conversation. It's a thousand small conversations, and it is really starting young,\" she said.

Influenced by the mix of free European immigration, enslaved Africans and their descendents, and the more recent waves of Latin American, Asian, African and Middle Eastern immigration, Atlanta's food scene is bustling with choices from around the world. \n\n\"There's an ongoing\u00a0reappraisal of traditional southern food, and, running on a parallel track, a deepening appreciation for the cooking of newer immigrants,\" says John T. Edge, executive director of the Southern Foodways Alliance.\n\n\"Chefs are interpreting both at the same time, examining the deeper southern path that informs the city and embracing our region's multicultural future. That's what a mature town does -- grapple with the past and look to the future. \"\n\nHere are our eight picks for the greater Atlanta area's bustling dining scene. \n\nBrush Sushi Izakaya\n\nLiang decided to open his first restaurant in Decatur, the busy college town and foodie destination, attracted by sophisticated local eateries including Kimball House, The Pinewood, No. 246 and long-time resident Cakes & Ale.\n\nWhat Decatur didn't have was a Japanese bar. Liang offers several choices of sake, including a few on tap. With Japanese fish and rice flown in and fresh Georgia chicken and vegetables, Brush is farm-to-table cuisine with a twist. \n\n\"We wanted to create a destination restaurant, with authentic cuisine like when you eat at a high-end sushi restaurant in Tokyo, \" Liang tells CNN. \"People care about the food.

Hidinger died in 2014. \n\nMORE: Couple turns cancer support into a lasting legacy\n\nChef Ryan Smith cooks high-end, nose-to-tail, farm-to-table cuisine, and the restaurant is fully booked as quickly as reservations open mid-month for the next month. \n\nAll profits go to the Giving Kitchen, a non-profit Hidinger's widow, Jen, and friends set up to support food workers in need. \n\n\"Staplehouse acts as like a lighthouse for guests who come to dine and come to feel inspired and be a part of something,\" Jen Hidinger tells CNN. \"It's something tangible.\"\n\nStaplehouse, 541 Edgewood Ave. SE, Atlanta, GA; +1 404 524 5005\n\nMiller Union\n\nAt Chef Steven Satterfield's highly regarded Miller Union, the influences of a multicultural city often makes their way into his seasonal menus. \n\n\"I take cues from other types of cooking because Atlanta is a multicultural city, and people are open to experiencing new food ideas,\" says Satterfield, who worked for longtime Atlanta chef Anne Quatrano and former Watershed chef Scott Peacock before opening his own restaurant. \"I think that's how southern food evolved.\"\n\n\"We've dug deeper into our roots for historical context in the last 10 years to see how cultures can meld together on the plate.\" \n\nThe duck breast on his current dinner menu, offered with sweet potato, savoy cabbage, farro spaetzle and maple gastrique, is cooked with ginger and a little cardamom. \n\n\"It's subtle but it works and it tastes great,\" he says. \n\nMiller Union, 999 Brady Ave NW, Atlanta, GA; +1 678 733 8550\n\nSpice to Table\n\nThat creativity can also be seen at Spice to Table, a low-key Indian lunch restaurant launched by chef Asha Gomez, who was born and raised in Southern India and moved to Atlanta after she married more than 20 years ago. (She also credits Quatrano for inspiration.)\n\nHer fried chicken has been dubbed some of the best in country, with its 24-hour brine with secret spices, coconut oil, mango sauce and roasted curry leaves. (It's only available Friday and Saturdays for lunch, until they run out.)\n\nSo has her spiced carrot cake, which people drive hundreds of miles to eat. Her version uses fresh carrots, clove, cardamom and black peppercorns, and it's also in her new cook book, \"My Two Souths.\"\n\n\"My food and what I put on plate is the sum total of my life experiences,\" says Gomez, who previously ran the high-end Cardamom Hill. \"I love my roots and heritage, and I love this new home and southern cuisine.\"\n\nSpice to Table, 659 Auburn Avenue NE Suite 506, Atlanta, GA; +1 404 220 8945\n\nThe General Muir \n\nThe General Muir near Emory University, which takes a New York Jewish deli upscale, is one of food writer Susan Puckett's favorite restaurants with a sense of place. \n\nThere's high-end seasonal cuisine, but the all-important reuben sandwich, pastrami sandwich, bagels and lox and more are generally available.

He has other things to be doing.\"\n\nDan Kulin, a spokesperson for the county, told CNN that no early voting stations extended their closing times. They did, however, process voters who were in line at closing time to allow as many people to vote as possible.  \n\nJudge warns Trump campaign about internet trolls\n\nTrump's campaign also sought information about the people who were present at the sites in dispute -- a request Sturman angrily shot down, expressing her frustration with Brian Hardy, a lawyer for the campaign. \n\n\"Do you watch Twitter?\" she asked. \"There are internet trolls who could get this information and harass people who just want to help their fellow citizens vote.\"\n\n\"Why would I order them to make available to you information about people who work at polls when its not already a public requirement to do so. So that those people can be harassed for doing their civic duty?\"\n\nShe added: \"I'm just puzzled how you think you will use this evidence anyway.\" \n\nDonald F. McGahn II, Trump's campaign attorney, said that the suit was filed to preserve records and that the county attorney made clear in open court that the records would be preserved. McGahn said that ensuring that records are persevered is standard business.\n\nNevada key to both parties\n\nNevada's six electoral votes may be critical Tuesday night, and the Senate race is key in terms of the balance of power. \n\nNevada's Republican Party chairman, Michael McDonald, told a Trump audience in Reno on Saturday that polling locations were kept open late so that a \"certain group\" could vote.\n\n\"Last night, in Clark County, they kept a poll open 'til 10 o'clock at night so a certain group could vote,\" McDonald said in introductory remarks at a Trump rally. \"The polls are supposed to close at 7. This was kept open until 10. Yeah, you feel free right now? You think this is a free and easy election? That's why it's important.\"\n\nAt that rally, Trump suggested that the polling location's extended closing time to allow voters to cast their ballots was a sign of a \"rigged system\" pitted against his campaign.\n\n\"It's being reported that certain key Democratic polling locations in Clark County were kept open for hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring democratic voters in. Folks, it's a rigged system. It's a rigged system and we're going to beat it. We're going to beat it,\" Trump said.\n\n\"From the polling, it appears that Nevada is so close that the Trump campaign thinks it's worth challenging any violation in voting protocol,\" said Robert Lang of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"The numbers that came in could represent several thousand people across the four precincts, which could determine who wins the electoral college vote or change the Senate race. \n\nSteve Vladeck, CNN legal analyist and professor at the University of Texas Law School, questioned what Trump's campaign got as a result of the suit.\n\n\"The real question is whether the Trump campaign truly wanted an order from the district court, or whether the point was simply to begin to make a record around which the result in Nevada might be challenged after the fact,\" Vladeck said. \"If the former, it failed miserably. If the latter, it seems like a lot of wasted effort if, as the court ruled, state law already required all of this information to be preserved.\"\n\nHillary Clinton's campaign praised the judge's ruling.\n\n\"We're pleased the judge swiftly denied what was a frivolous attempt to disenfranchise voters in Clark County and a desperate response to the record turnout we're seeing in Nevada and across the country.

After years of desertification, its rich biodiversity is under threat and drought has hindered the fight against hunger.\n\nThis burden is affecting not only the country's food security and sustainable development, but also the homes of many Sudanese families.\n\nDust storms -- known locally as \"Haboob\" -- have also increased in this region. Moving like a gigantic thick wall, it carries sand and dust -- burying homes, increasing evaporation to a region that's struggling to preserve water supplies, as well as eroding valuable fertile soil. \n\nExperts say that without quick intervention, parts of the African country -- one of the most vulnerable in the world -- could become uninhabitable as a result of climate change.\n\nIncreasing temperature\n\n\"North Africa is already hot and is strongly increasing in temperature. At some point in this century, part of the region will become uninhabitable,\" Jos Lelieveld, a climate scientist from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, told CNN.\n\n\"That will string from Morocco all the way through to Saudi Arabia,\" he said.\n\nSudan's temperature is expected to increase significantly. By 2060, it's projected to rise between 1.1 \u00b0C and 3.1 \u00b0C.\n\nAs a result of hotter climate and erratic rainfall, much of Sudan has become progressively unsuitable for agriculture and villages. \n\nIrregular rain has ruined crops, and the country is experiencing both droughts and floods -- making arable land unsuitable for cultivation and displacing more than 600,000 people due to flood-related disasters since 2013, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC).\n\nMichelle Yonetani, a senior advisor on disasters from IDMC, says 70 percent of the rural population are reliant on traditional rain-fed agriculture -- for both food and livelihood -- while 80 percent of the population rely on rainfall for their water supply.\n\nShe told CNN that Sudan was facing a \"hugely complex emergency situation.\"\n\n\"Drought aggravates desertification which affects the savannah belt in the northern region -- so these encroaching deserts have been displacing entire villages.\"\n\nYonetani said Sudan was one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change because of the issue of food security -- it ranks 98th out of 113 countries on the Global Hunger Index, placing it in the top 15 most food-insecure countries in the world.\n\nCommunities 'pushed to the limits'\n\nUntil the late 20th century, the Sahel -- the transitional zone between the desert and the tropical south -- was peppered with baobab and acacia trees as well as sparse grass cover. But now desertification is changing the landscape and invading on precious agricultural and habitable land.\n\n\"Communities who are already very vulnerable -- who are already suffering from impoverishment, who may be in areas that may be affected by climate change -- are pushed to the limits of their coping mechanisms,\" Yonetani said.\n\nThe livelihoods for farmers located in thousands of villages spread across this region are becoming increasingly strained because of heat stress and persistent drought.\n\nAccording to a report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), earlier this year it was estimated that 1.9 million people could be affected by reduced agricultural and livestock production -- due to the impacts of this year's weather phenomenon, El Ni\u00f1o. During the recent El Ni\u00f1o, locals experienced smaller farming areas, poor pastures and limited water availability. \n\nAnd 3.2 million people were expected to face water shortages, potentially causing what OCHA said was a \"further deterioration of already fragile sanitation and hygiene conditions.\" \n\nIDMC's Yonteani said this crisis wasn't a humanitarian crisis, \"It's a crisis of development.\"\n\nBut head of Program for the World Food Programme (WFP) in Sudan, Marco Cavalcante, told CNN it's not too late to change the country's future.\n\n\"This trend is not unstoppable if important measures are taken.\"\n\nA lasting impact\n\nTo make a lasting impact against climate change, holistic adaptation and mitigation efforts need to target farmers, pastoralist communities as well as vulnerable groups who are affected by the food insecurity.\n\nThe government released a renewable adaptation plan in July which published agreed strategies to protect Sudanese people -- particularly those in rural communities.\n\n\"It's a very positive sign that there is a political commitment,\" Cavalcante said.\n\nWithin the report, Sudan's Ministry of Environment has broken down adaptation plans for each region of Sudan. Strategies include drought resistant crop varieties that can withstand shifting climate conditions, more efficient irrigation technologies and improved crop storage.\n\nWFP's Cavalcante added that crop storage was important to ensure farmers weren't forced to sell right after harvesting when the price may be low.\n\nHe also said that because of the variability in climatic conditions, farmers may experience a good harvest one year and a bad one the next. So by improving crop storage, they can \"ensure income for the following year.\"\n\nThe report also outlined plans to dig more wells and boreholes to alleviate water scarcity.\n\nThe WFP also has helped Sudan construct \"haffirs\" (water reservoirs) to help retain water and boost crop yields in years of poor rainfall.\n\nCommunities are also being taught how to plant trees to help combat desertification -- which Cavalcante says has a \"substantial impact\" on Sudan's future.\n\nCan the Great Green Wall change direction?\n\nHealth is also a large focus of the government's adaptation plan. It says climate change could accelerate the spread of malaria, yellow fever and cholera -- and while investment into education to ensure humans are more resilient to climatic shocks is important, there also needs to be research into the link between rising temperatures, water stress and the spread of those diseases.\n\nWhile Sudan is making efforts to fix the issue of climate change, it's not one that the country can fix alone. Climate change is a global challenge affecting every continent, and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to scientist Lelieveld, is one of the most important aspects.\n\nFunding needed to help Africa\n\nDespite being one of the most affected countries by climate change, the funding Sudan receives to help combat the pressures is significantly lower than other countries.\n\nExperts say it's going to take a substantial amount to expand adaptation projects to lower temperatures, prevent desertification from intruding on precious habitable and agricultural land and to educate communities on how to adjust.\n\n\"There needs to be far more investment and early measures to strengthen the resilience at the community level,\" Yonetani said.\n\nWhy climate deal is everyone's business\n\nShe said by encouraging governments to increase its commitment to act upon climate is \"perhaps one of the most indirect ways, but globally the most important.\"\n\n\"Now really is the time to push governments to act and mitigate,\" she added.\n\nUnless the world is prepared to take on refugees as a result of the food crisis and uninhabitable areas, \"we will have to help Africa to invest and protect itself,\" Lelieveld said.\n\n\"They didn't cause this problem,\" he added. \"We did.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.45804214477539, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1046, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.67217062849, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.48565965583174, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/asia/myanmar-rohingya-aung-san-suu-kyi/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 947, "scraper_regex": 1004}}, "headline": "Is The Lady listening?

The Myanmar government's official position denies recognition of the term \"Rohingya\" and regards them as illegal Bengali migrants.\n\nThroughout, many have looked to Myanmar's civilian government, and particularly Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, to act as a check on the military. \n\nThe National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Suu Kyi, won a landslide victory in elections late last year, ending more than two decades of brutal military rule.\n\nHowever, under a constitution drafted by the former junta, the military retains 25% of the seats in parliament, and control of security matters.\n\nThe Myanmar Armed Forces, or Tatmadaw, is led by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who was handpicked by former junta strongman Than Shwe to succeed him in 2011. \n\nWhile analysts did not dispute that the military is leading operations in Rakhine, they expressed disappointment with the government's lack of action.\n\n\"That the government has simply flatly denied human rights violations are taking place does not bode well for the NLD,\" said Matthew Smith, founder of Bangkok-based Fortify Rights.\n\n\"When these types of violations are being committed by the government it is reason for concern for everyone in the country.\"\n\nRisk of instability\n\nAs violence in Rakhine has persisted, Kofi Annan -- the former United Nations secretary general who currently leads a Myanmar government commission -- warned it is \"plunging the state into renewed instability.\" \n\nUnited Nations envoy Zainab Hawa Bangura has also expressed grave concern over allegations of rape and sexual assault of women and girls in Rakhine as part of a \"wider pattern of ethnically motivated violence\" in the region.\n\nIn a statement this week, the Myanmar President's office, citing military information teams, \"refuted the fabrications\" published by foreign media and blamed violence on terrorist groups. \n\nPresidential spokesman Zaw Htay, who previously served the country's military rulers, denied reports of troops burning houses and allegations of rape and sexual assault during a press conference Wednesday. \n\nHe promised that the government would \"cooperate with the media for sensitive conflict reports in the future.\" \n\nHuman Rights Watch has repeatedly criticized the Myanmar government's denial of access to the region for human rights monitors and journalists.\n\nCNN has repeatedly reached out to Suu Kyi's office for comment but hasn't received a response.\n\nDisappointment\n\nIn an interview with CNN in September, Suu Kyi said her government was having \"a lot of trouble trying to bring about the kind of harmony and understanding and tolerance that we wish for.\" \n\n\"This is not the only problem we have to face, (but) this is one on which the international community has focused,\" Suu Kyi said, pointing to the establishment of Annan's commission and the lifting on some restrictions on the movement of Rohingya as actions her administration has taken. \n\nNevertheless, at times Suu Kyi's silence on the issue has been deafening. Smith described the current response as \"deeply concerning.\" \n\n\"I don't have words to describe the disappointment with her government,\" he said. \n\nWhile he was skeptical over how much power the civilian government had to influence military activity in Rakhine state, Anthony Ware, a Myanmar specialist at Australia's Deakin University, said Suu Kyi's silence was a \"long term consistent trend.\" \n\n\"We have not seen a lot of leadership on this issue from (Suu Kyi or the NLD),\" he said. \n\nWith the military in full control of security issues, and backed up by its 25% base in parliament, its unclear how much effect a more vocal NLD government could have.\n\nThere is also strong support among the country's Buddhist majority for anti-Rohingya actions and angry anti-Muslim rhetoric has increasingly become part of mainstream discourse in Myanmar, led by ultra-nationalist Buddhist monks.\n\n\"Muslims are perceived nationally, even by most of the ethnic minorities, as a threat to Buddhism and threat to national security,\" Ware said.\n\nMilitary abuses\n\nBefore and after the country's transition to democracy, the Myanmar military has been accused of torture, rape, and the systematic abuse of child soldiers. \n\nRights groups have documented continued widespread abuses against ethnic minorities, particularly in Rakhine and Kachin states. \n\n\"All of the key issues in Rakhine State and activities are under military control,\" said Ware.\n\n\"While there are armed elements in Rakhine, and while there are significant fears of a loss of control of the border and potential international Islamic terrorist influence, the military will not allow anyone else to have much of a say.\"\n\nSmith said the military is carrying out a \"clearance operation\" against Muslims in the region, and warned that international crimes may be being committed. \n\n\"We've documented how Rakhine State authorities were talking about a plan to demolish Muslim-owned properties prior to the October attacks. It would appear that strategy is in some ways being carried out in another context,\" he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.899902820587161, "HarmVice": 12, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 947, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.31602817108, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 45, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161117090000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.090909090909999, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.75184794086589, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/15/politics/trump-supporter-jack-kingston-lindsey-graham-russia/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 772, "scraper_regex": 823}}, "headline": "Donald Trump supporters in Moscow as sanctions fight heats up", "wordcount_as_scraped": 823, "date": "20161216050000", "story_content": "A Donald Trump supporter and former member of Congress is in Russia this week, as questions about the President-elect's policies toward Moscow roil his transition.\n\nFormer Georgia Rep. Jack Kingston spoke this week in the Russian capital with American business leaders in a closed-door session. Publicly, however, he suggested that Western sanctions on Russia over its aggression in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea could be lifted.\n\n\"Trump can look at sanctions. They've been in place long enough,\" Kingston said during an interview with NPR in Moscow. \"Has the desired result been reached? He doesn't have to abide by the Obama foreign policy. That gives him a fresh start.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Kingston's visit or remarks.\n\nThe sanctions resulted from a major push from US to coordinate with its European allies, who might see the move as an abandonment of cooperation with Europe. At the same time, the Europeans have been less enthusiastic about the economic restrictions because of their trade ties to Russia and would be unlikely to extend them if Trump no longer backs them.\n\n\"Among the many questions the businesses asked ... they had a number of questions, but one of the questions was 'What about sanctions?' to which I said 'Sanctions not something the administrations going to lead with at all,'\" Kingston told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The Lead\" Thursday. \"The sanctions have been in place a while now. The administration should take a look and say, 'Are the results what we were looking for?' Brand new administration, it's a good time to revitalize.\"\n\nBack in the US, Kingston's former colleagues in Congress are wrestling over how to respond to Russia's alleged interference in the presidential election -- with many, Republicans included, calling for additional sanctions due to US intelligence assessments of hacking of Democratic organizations.\n\nOne of the consistent messages of Trump's presidential campaign was a promised push for better relations with Russia, in particular its President Vladimir Putin. \n\nIn nominating ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to lead the State Department, Trump again signaled his desire for a diplomatic thaw through the pursuit of shared economic and foreign policy goals. Tillerson, who did extensive business in Russia and was recommended to the transition by a group of Republican establishment foreign policy hands who do business with the oil giant, was awarded the Order of Friendship by Putin in 2013.\n\nBut Tillerson's nomination has set off alarm bells among some Senate Republicans. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room\" Wednesday, \"I can't imagine I would vote (to confirm) anybody that believes that we should not sanction Russia, given the fact that they did in fact interfere in our election.\"\n\n\"If they don't believe sanctions are appropriate, given what Putin has been doing all over the world, including in our backyard, then I don't think they have the judgment to be secretary of state,\" he added, \"because if you don't go after Russia, you're inviting the other bad actors on the planet to come after you.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Graham's Democratic colleague, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, tweeted that she was \"down\" with his tweeted pledge to put \"crippling sanctions against Russia\" on Trump's White House desk.\n\nI'm down Lindsay. https://t.co/OaNW1KAAOo\u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) December 15, 2016\n\nControversial Trump loyalist Carter Page, who has spoken positively about the Tillerson nomination and opposes sanctions, also raised eyebrows recently when he turned up in Moscow and gave a presentation and news conference at the Russian state news outlet Sputnik.\n\n\"If you look at where the current state of US-Russia relations is, it's much more toxic and much more dangerous and there's a lot more work that needs to be done to overcome this,\" Page said, before suggesting reports on US intelligence assessments about Russian hacking during the campaign \"almost borders on the 'fake news' category.\" \n\nAsked by a reporter if he believed there was a deliberate US government attempt to deceive the American public about the source of the hacks, Page said it is \"very easy to make it look like it was country X, in this case, Russia, that did this.\"\n\n\"I've talked with various IT experts that have suggested that (intentional US misdirection) could very well be a serious possibility,\" he added, \"and these guys are pros to make certain paths that can mislead and again we've seen many mistakes from an intelligence standpoint previously.\"  \n\nOn Thursday, Trump still publicly questioned whether Russia was involved in hacking American politicians, an assertion uniformly supported by the US Intelligence community.\n\n\"If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?

Most Africans have a mutation of this gene that doesn't allow it to be expressed in red blood cells, and therefore the parasite finds it difficult to get into the red blood cells of these individuals -- giving those with the mutation a high level of resistance.\n\nIt's impossible to know exact population figures for the DARC variant but frequency rates are thought to be around 95% in West Africa, and between 70 to 95% in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSiwo and his team found that in some patients those with this inbuilt resistance had lower survival rates for breast cancer than those without.\n\nThe research and findings were recently presented at the American Society for Human Genetics symposium on Pharmacogenomics, and will be published next year.\n\nPotential for personalized therapy\n\nA mutation in the DARC gene and its potential link with cancer outcomes is \"very interesting\" says Dr Sarah Tishkoff, a professor of genetics and biology at the University of Pennsylvania.  It is \"of potential high significance, particularly given observed differences in cancer risk among different ethnic groups,\" she adds.\n\n\"If this variant does play a role in cancer metastasis, it would be an example where a genetic variant which rises to high frequency due to protection from malaria may also be associated with disease risk\", she adds.  \n\nRead: Fever rising, how an illustrator's images helped the fight against Ebola\n\nDr Tishkoff suggests negative outcomes have been known for other malaria resistance genes for example those associated with Sickle Cell Anemia. But more evidence is needed she notes on whether it directly impacts cancer statistics. \n\nSimilar studies, for example research carried out in China, presumed that a lack of DARC expression predisposes African American men to a greater incidence and mortality of prostate cancer, as well as a similar correlation between the DARC variant and breast cancer deaths.  \n\n\"It could be further explored by future studies in Africa looking for correlations between variation at this gene and [the] risk of cancer,\" says Dr Tishkoff. \n\nSiwo agrees that more research is needed, which the team intends to carry out, but he's enthusiastic on potential findings. \"The knowledge that low expression of DARC might influence breast cancer outcomes, especially in some breast cancer patients means that in future it could potentially be used for personalizing therapy or precision medicine,\" he says. \n\nCancer, often diagnosed late\n\n\"The true extent of cancer [within Africa] has not been realized because it is mostly diagnosed at the late stages,\" adds Siwo. \n\nIn South Africa, there's a five-year lag time between hospitals recording a cancer diagnosis and it being documented in annual national statistics of new cases. \n\n\"That means, the cancer statistics we have for South Africa today is outdated by about five years, a problem that also occurs in all other countries even though with a lesser delay,\" says Siwo.\n\nThe team wants to work towards faster data collection within South Africa and more widely across the continent. By tracking data digitally and pooling efforts across Africa, we can attempt to improve this, explains Siwo.\n\nHis team is working with the South African National Cancer Registry and the University of Witswaterand in Johannesburg to develop a system that would automatically collate the required cancer statistics in a shorter time frame.\n\nGreater access to technology means \"we are looking at solving problems in Africa in a way we never thought possible before,\" he says.\n\nSiwo believes diseases such as cancer will start to impact Africa more so than elsewhere if not properly tackled. There is a wider reach to try and get more of Africa's budding scientists involved in targeted solutions through organized hackathons and problem-solving workshops within South Africa.\n\n\"We are attempting to find long-term solutions,\" says Siwo. \"New ways of addressing and treating cancer, TB, AIDS, HIV -- these answers can only be found through the engagement of young scientists in Africa.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.7372593879699703, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 810, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.21287855128, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 4, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.987654320987654, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/opinions/trump-tweets-on-hamilton-snl-obeidallah/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Chilled by Trump tweets? You should be", "wordcount_as_scraped": 892, "date": "20161121000000", "story_content": "This weekend we saw President-elect Donald Trump lash out twice at Americans who were exercising their constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression. His reaction should chill every American with its implication: A President Trump may well try to suppress speech.\n\nOn Friday night, Vice-President-elect Mike Pence attended a performance of the smash hit Broadway musical \"Hamilton,\" where some in the crowd reportedly booed him.  On Sunday, Pence acknowledged this: \"When we arrived we heard a few boos, and we heard some cheers,\" he said, \"I nudged my kids and reminded them that is what freedom sounds like.\" He's right.\n\nThat wasn't good enough for Trump. News reports of the incident \u2014 and the optics that came along with them -- were apparently too much for him, and he took to Twitter to make it clear that Americans should never engage in that type of expression: \"Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!\" \n\nTrump's line \"This should not happen!\" could not be more wrong.  Americans have every right to boo our elected officials, who, after all, are employed by the country's citizens. It's a form of expression that is, and must continue to be, protected.\n\nBut there was more. On Sunday morning Trump stunningly lashed out at \"Saturday Night Live\" because the comedy show featured comedy at his expense, as it long has.  Trump tweeted: \"I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?\" \n\nThink about what Trump is saying with this tweet.  The man who will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States in January is not just upset that a comedy show is making fun of him but is demanding it make changes to its content to please him. Trump -- a man who hosted \"SNL\" twice -- is undoubtedly aware that mocking our presidents is a tradition that separates our nation from dictatorships, where such speech is not freely allowed. \n\nAnd this is not the first time Trump went after \"SNL,\" a show that for decades has drawn viewers precisely because of its up-to-the-minute satire. Just 24 days before Election Day, Trump was so outraged at \"SNL's\" comically ridiculing him that he called for the show to be canceled, tweeting that \"SNL\" did a \"hit job on me,\" adding, \"Time to retire the boring and unfunny show.\" \n\nAt the time, concerns over Trump's comments were tempered by the fact that polls showed it was unlikely he would win. But that has changed and so must our response.\n\nIf a President Trump continues on this path unchallenged, the result could be new limitations on free speech.   For one thing, comedy shows and even other critics of the prospective President may begin to self-censor. \n\nWhy? Well, as we have seen, a certain sect of Trump's fans has viciously attacked critics on his behalf. For example, some Jewish journalists who have criticized Trump have been subjected to vile, anti-Semitic hate from self-professed Trump fans.  These reporters and writers have not only been sent disgusting Holocaust imagery on social media, but some Trump fans also found the home addresses of these journalists and made death threats. \n\nWhere is Trump's denunciation of this behavior?  On the contrary, with his own words, he seeks to stifle dissent -- even before he has assumed his new job -- emboldening his followers in their intimidation.  It is easy to see how fear could cause some to muzzle their valid criticism of Trump. \n\nThere is also anther concern.  Trump's comments on the campaign trial have to make you wonder if he truly values freedom of the press or expression.  During his campaign, Trump defended violent attacks upon those protesters who dared to interrupt him.  \n\nAnd Trump has even vowed to change the libel laws to crack down on the media criticizing him. As Trump told us in February, he wanted the libel laws revised so that if journalists write \"purposely negative\" articles, \"we can sue them and win lots of money.\" \n\nApart from enacting laws, no one can assure us that a President Trump, given his self-professed vindictive nature, would not pressure the Federal Communications Commission or TV executives to cancel comedy shows that mock him \"unfairly.\"  In fact a President has done this kind of thing before: President Richard Nixon reportedly lobbied CBS executives to cancel \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" in 1969 because they criticized him comedically. \n\nMike Pence is correct that dissent is the sound of freedom. And if you value freedom of expression, you cannot simply dismiss Trump's tweets this weekend, especially given his track record.  Our nation, of course, will not lose freedom of expression over a few tweets. But it's the job of the President to uphold the Constitution and the values that we hold dear, not threaten to undermine them over petty slights that are, in any case, protected speech. \n\nIf we don't speak out loudly when even minor threats against our freedom of expression are made by elected officials, then little by little that right will be chipped away.\n\nAnd one day we may find ourselves living in a nation where we have lost the ability to criticize our leaders. And that should concern every American who values freedom.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.9501039981842, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 892, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.8982375470700001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161121000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 2, "MoralityGenera": 7, "pct_mft_words": 2.69058295964126, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/22/asia/nepal-teen-dies-menstruation-hut/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 660, "scraper_regex": 710}}, "headline": "Nepal failing to protect women? 15-year-old dies in 'menstruation hut' ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 710, "date": "20161222100000", "story_content": "Deep in the Himalayas, the night rolled in and a girl in a tiny hut lit a fire to keep warm.\n\nAs she slept, the 15-year-old died of smoke inhalation.

If she fetches water, the well will dry up.\"\n\nIn some areas, the restrictions extend to girls reading, writing or touching books during menstruation out of fear of angering Saraswati, the goddess of education. \n\nRestrictions\n\nChhaupadi was outlawed by Nepal's Supreme Court in 2005 and the government promulgated guidelines three years later to eradicate it nationally, but chhaupadi persists, particularly in the country's far west. \n\nOverall statistics are unavailable, but the practice is most common in Achham, Doti and Bajura districts. \n\nGajra village was declared a \"chhaupadi-free zone\" in 2015, but Achham women's development officer Bhagwati Aryal said that more than 70% of the 138,000 women in the district still perform the practice. \n\n\"Our law has banned this practice, but there is no provision in the law which states punishment for those involved,\" she said. \"Until and unless we have a stricter law with punishment for the culprits, changes will come very slow.\" \n\nAround 1,500 people live in Gajra, according to government statistics. Birendra Niraula, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare, said the \"chhaupadi-free zone\" categorization was achieved when 90% of the houses in any village had dropped the practice. \n\n\"Local shamans started telling parents that any bad luck that has befallen the village was due to girls and women breaking the chhaupadi tradition,\" she said. \"So parents in some villages started to get their daughters and wives back to following the practice again.\" \n\nWhile the 15-year-old's death was \"very tragic,\" Niraula said such incidents were \"very rare these days, which is a good sign.\" \n\nDiscrimination \n\nWhile some success has been made in stamping out chhaupadi, the practice is a symptom of wider gender-discrimination in Nepal. \n\nAccording to UNESCO, around 45% of women and girls in Nepal are illiterate, almost double the rate for men. \n\nA study by the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers in 2012 found that almost half of women had experienced gender-based violence in their lifetimes, while 28% had experienced it in the past 12 months. \n\nMore than 60% of women who experienced such violence did not share or discuss their experiences with anyone.\n\nChild marriage is also prevalent, with 37% of girls marrying before they are 18, and 10% before they are 15, according to Human Rights Watch. \n\n\"These marriages result from a web of factors including poverty, lack of access to education, child labor, social pressures, and harmful practices,\" HRW said.\n\n\"Cutting across all of these is entrenched gender inequality, and damaging social norms that make girls less valued than boys in Nepali society.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.61329698562622, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 660, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.65644246894, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.87878787878788, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/trump-transition-rollercoaster-ride/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1103, "scraper_regex": 1208}}, "headline": "Trump's transition rollercoaster ride", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1208, "date": "20161118120000", "story_content": "Donald Trump's campaign was entirely unconventional, and his transition to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is proving to be just that.\n\nTrump announced Friday that he has chosen key members of his national security team, including CIA director, attorney general and national security advisor. Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas has been selected for CIA director. Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has been offered the job of national security advisor and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions has been picked for attorney general. All three have accepted their offers.\n\nThe news followed signs on Thursday that the weight of the presidency is beginning to sink in for Trump, and that the President-elect may be shifting from the bomb-throwing tactics he employed during the campaign to a more nuanced approach.\n\nThe President-elect held his first meeting with a world leader, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, on Thursday. It was a most unusual setup -- arranged without any formal briefing for Trump from the State or Defense departments.\n\nThe chaotic nature of the Trump transition continues to give jitters to Democrats, some Republicans in Washington, as well as allies in governments around the world. For months, diplomats and world leaders have watched Trump deliver incendiary speeches on the campaign trail with wariness and trepidation. \n\nBut Abe spoke positively about the meeting afterwards, calling it a candid conversation and saying he believed they could form a relationship of mutual respect.\n\nTrump also arranged meetings with Republicans who were among his fiercest critics, a display of normalcy after a week of upheaval and apparent chaos for his transition team. \n\nFirst, he replaced New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had been overseeing the transition, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, and subsequently purged lobbyists from the ranks, in keeping with his vow to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington.\n\nThen there was the lightning rod announcement of former Breitbart chief executive Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser -- which sent shockwaves through activist groups who view the Breitbart site as racist and anti-Semitic.\n\nThursday, more conventional Republican faces began appearing at Trump Tower as the team continued vetting potential Cabinet members and advisers at a furious pace, with literally thousands of government positions to fill within a very short window of time.\n\nTrump met with foreign policy heavyweight Henry Kissinger, as well as Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and one-time critic South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who are both under serious consideration for Cabinet jobs.\n\nIn perhaps the most surprising news, Trump plans to meet this weekend in New Jersey with 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who was one of Trump's most vociferous critics during the campaign (calling him a phony, and a fraud, and skewering him on Twitter for the way in which he talked about women on a leaked \"Access Hollywood\" tape). \n\nRomney may be considered for a Cabinet post -- possibly secretary of state -- though sources close to the former Massachusetts governor say he has not actively sought a role in the Trump administration and merely agreed to meet with Trump as a gesture of good faith. \n\nEstablishment Republicans viewed the more recent developments with relief on Thursday -- a signal that Trump may be giving more serious thought to addressing the deep fissures in his party.\n\nTrump's outreach to Haley and Romney, seemed to demonstrate a possible willingness to assemble a team of rivals in his government -- which would be a surprising pivot for a man who wrote in his 1997 book \"The Art of the Comeback\" that one of his maxims was to \"get even\" and that he believed \"in an eye for an eye. \n\nWorld is watching\n\nMany world leaders were eager to make contact with him after his surprising victory last week. But with Trump's own team in transition, that was no easy feat. \n\nFor example, Trump was connected with the Australian prime minister, sources told CNN, by a mutual acquaintance, golfer Greg Norman, who happened to have his phone number.\n\nSeveral diplomats told CNN that they reached out to Trump Tower to schedule congratulatory calls for their head of state. Once the calls were arranged, they were connected without being asked for any verification of their identities or measures to verify the authenticity of the call.\n\nSome diplomats who had set up meetings with transition team members for the coming days discovered those officials were gone as part of this past week's purge of Christie's team and anyone registered as a lobbyist.\n\nAmidst the initial confusion about who was in charge, one diplomat wondered whether to reach out directly to Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is one of his closest advisers, or his daughter Ivanka Trump.\n\nHaving been elected without any prior government experience, Trump's conversations unsurprisingly are bucking traditional diplomatic protocol The Times of London reported on a leaked transcript of Trump's call with British Prime Minister Theresa May, where Trump reportedly offered her the most casual of invitations to meet with him: \"If you travel to the US, you should let me know.\"\n\n'A certain amount of chaos'\n\nAfter Trump's White House meeting with President Barack Obama, there also was a lapse in communication with the current agency personnel who will ensure a smooth transition of power.\n\nThat problem -- delays created by Trump's team not getting paperwork and a list of names to the White House -- appeared to be corrected Thursday when a transition official reported that four teams -- from the Department of State, Department of Justice, Department of Defense and National Security Council -- have been connected with the proper agency points of contact.\n\nWhile Trump's team has come under a hail of criticism this week, both Democratic and Republican officials who have been involved in past transition planning cautioned that a fair amount of chaos was to be expected, particularly given that many of Trump's own advisers did not expect him to win. Presidents-elect generally don't announce major nominees like Secretary of State within nine days of the election anyway.\n\n\"Lots of reasons to be concerned about @realDonaldTrump transition,\" former Obama adviser David Axelrod tweeted, \"but the pace of announcements isn't one of them. That's not a fair shot.\"\n\n\"We hadn't made any major appointments at this point in 2008,\" Axelrod added. \"I don't remember being criticized for it.\"\n\nLanhee Chen, a former Romney advisor and a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said it was hard to judge at this early stage whether things were going more or less smoothly than they did under Obama or President George W. Bush, even though the teams of those two candidates were highly organized and ready to deploy as soon as they clinched victory.  \n\n\"There's a certain amount of chaos that is built into every transition,\" Chen said. \"There always is this challenge of meshing campaign staff with transition staff with campaign staff. If Governor Romney had won in 2012, I think that there would have been some issues to sort through as well.\"\n\n\"Some of this is part of a natural process,\" said Chen, a CNN contributor. \"It's important to keep in mind that the Republican Party was pretty divided throughout this election, and part of what we are seeing is an effort, not just to build a new administration, but to heal some of the wounds from that fight.\"  ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.27334463596344, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1103, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.33549683248, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161118120000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 1.99456029011786, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/23/politics/israel-official-rips-obama-un-settlements/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1240, "scraper_regex": 1487}}, "headline": "US abstains as UN demands end to Israeli settlements", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1487, "date": "20161223210000", "story_content": "The United States on Friday allowed a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction to be adopted, defying extraordinary pressure from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government in alliance with President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe Security Council approved the resolution with 14 votes, with the US abstaining. There was applause in the chamber following the vote, which represented perhaps the final bitter chapter in the years of antagonism between President Barack Obama's administration and Netanyahu's government.\n\nIn an intense flurry of diplomacy that unfolded in the two days before the vote, a senior Israeli official had accused the United States of abandoning the Jewish state with its refusal to block the resolution with a veto.\n\nTrump had also inserted himself in the diplomatic drama, in defiance of the convention that the United States has only one president at a time, by calling on the Obama administration to wield its Security Council veto.\n\nIsrael's UN ambassador, Danny Danon, reacted angrily to the vote and issued a sharp parting shot at the Obama administration's role.\n\n\"It was to be expected that Israel's greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share and that they would have vetoed this disgraceful resolution. I have no doubt that the new US administration and the incoming UN Secretary General will usher in a new era in terms of the UN's relationship with Israel,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, Netanyahu's office accused the Obama administration of \"colluding\" with the UN and said it looked forward to working with Trump, as well as Israel-friendly members of Congress, \"to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.\"\n\nThe US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, raised her hand to abstain in the chamber when the resolution was put to a vote.\n\nPower argued after the vote that opposing settlement expansion was consistent with the bipartisan consensus accepted by every single US president of both parties since Ronald Reagan, in comments that could be seen as a criticism of Trump's position.\n\n\"This resolution reflects trends that will permanent destroy the two state solution if they continue on their current course,\" Power said in a speech before the chamber.\n\n\"Our vote today does not in any way diminish the United States' steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel,\" Power said.\n\nThe Palestinians were delighted by their rare diplomatic coup.\n\n\"This is a victory for the people and for the cause, and it opens doors wide for the demand of sanctions on settlements,\" said Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian leader.\n\n\"This is a bias towards justice and international law.\"\n\nBut Trump -- who has vowed to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and has nominated an ambassador in David Friedman who is supportive of settlers -- pledged that the Palestinians would no longer have a platform at the UN when he is inaugurated next month.\n\n\"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th,\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump tweeted, \"The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace. Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!\"\n\nThe United States and most other nations consider Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem as an obstacle to the hopes of a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians. \n\nThe Obama administration, which mounted two failed efforts to broker Middle East peace, became increasingly angry about continued Israeli settlement expansion over its eight years in the White House. The Palestinians accuse Israel of trying to establish facts on the ground by building on land they view as part of their future state.\n\n\"Today, the United States acted with one primary objective in mind: to preserve the possibility of the two state solution, which every US administration for decades has agreed is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement, adding that the US does not \"agree with every aspect\" of the resolution.\n\nHe added: \"We cannot in good conscience stand in the way of a resolution at the United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of peace.\"\n\n'Secretly cooked up'\n\nHours before the UN Security Council vote, the Israelis made clear their intense disappointment with the US over the resolution, which calls on Israel to \"immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.\"\n\n\"President Obama and Secretary Kerry are behind this shameful move against Israel at the UN,\" a senior Israeli official told CNN.\n\n\"The US administration secretly cooked up with the Palestinians an extreme anti-Israeli resolution behind Israel's back which would be a tailwind for terror and boycotts and effectively make the Western Wall occupied Palestinian territory,\" a senior Israeli official said.\n\nBefore the vote, a Palestinian official said, \"We have nothing to say about this. No President has troubled Palestinians in the UN more than President Obama.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported this week that Obama's advisers did not disclose a position on how the US would vote and were holding out until the vote to see how the matter developed. Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security advisor, told reporters Friday that he wasn't sure if Obama and Trump had spoken about this issue and added he was not aware of any particular conversation.\n\nRhodes said Obama made the decision this morning, adding that \"there's one president at a time.\"\n\nUS and Palestinian officials denied the Israeli accusation of colluding on the UN vote. The resolution was originally put forward by Egypt but it was withdrawn under pressure from the Israelis. Four countries, New Zealand, Venezuela, Malaysia and Senegal, brought it up again for a vote on Friday.\n\nA senior Obama administration official said, \"To be clear: from the start, this was an Egyptian resolution. The Egyptians authored it, circulated it, and submitted it for a vote on Wednesday evening before asking for a delay and subsequently removing their sponsorship.\n\n\"Contrary to some claims, the administration was not involved in formulating the resolution nor have we promoted it.\"\n\nA senior Palestinian official told CNN they were not informed how the US would handle the Security Council vote when a delegation was in town earlier this month to urge the administration to support it. The Palestinian official said they did not know how the US would vote and called the Israeli allegation \"totally untrue.\"\n\nTwo senior US officials involved in this process vehemently also denied the Israel accusation and also said that the US itself didn't really know how it was going to vote until Thursday morning. The official said Kerry himself was surprised that the Egyptians put the resolution forward so quickly. He was left scrambling to finish his speech and then left scrambling again when the Egyptians delayed the vote on Thursday.\n\n\"A veto means support of settlement activities,\" Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said after the resolution was pulled, according to the Times. \"A veto means abandoning the two-state solution and peace efforts.\"\n\nThe UN resolution -- which calls on Israel to \"immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem\" -- was delayed by Egypt after Israeli pressure.\n\nRaises tensions\n\nThe resolution exacerbated divisions between the outgoing Obama administration and incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Obama administration had been weighing whether to support the UN measure or abstain from voting, which would have been a break from the US's traditional practice of shielding Israel at the UN and other international organizations.\n\nThe Obama administration has grown increasingly frustrated by Israeli settlement construction and it has repeatedly warned it could foreclose the possibility of a two-state solution with the Palestinian people. The admission of an internal debate about the UN resolution illustrated how unhappy the administration is with the Israeli government.\n\nIsrael -- concerned by the outgoing administration's ambivalence -- reached out to Trump for support. An Israeli official told CNN that his country approached the Trump team after it felt that it had failed to persuade the Obama administration to veto the planned vote.\n\nThe official said that Israel \"implored the White House not to go ahead and told them that if they did, we would have no choice but to reach out to President-elect Trump.\"\n\nTrump subsequently put out a statement opposing the resolution.\n\n\"As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\" Trump said. \"This puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\"\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi also spoke with Trump by phone about the UN Security Council vote, according to a diplomatic source familiar with the call and an aide Trump. The call was first reported by Reuters.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.3562166690826403, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1240, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.93752869595, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161223210000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.2258064516129, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/opinions/21st-century-law-and-order-alexander/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "President Trump, we need 21st-century law and order", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1024, "date": "20161111230000", "story_content": "When candidate Donald Trump called himself the \"law and order candidate,\" the pundits scoffed. He sounded just like Richard Nixon, they said. \n\nBut Nixon, the 37th president, was not the first to associate himself with law and order. George Washington, the first president, called himself the nation's \"Chief Magistrate,\" a steward of law and order. Presidents and police officers take similar oaths, to protect and defend the Constitution. Having taken it, every president must be a law and order president. \n\nNow that he has been elevated from candidate to chief executive, Donald Trump is no exception. I appeal to him, however, to become the law and order president not for Nixon's 20th century, but for our 21st.   \n\nLaw is legislation as enacted by the people's representatives in government. We are all obliged to obey the law. Order, as we understand the concept in the 21st century, is created by the people, the police, the legislature, and the courts as they work together to administer the law. Order is not simply forced on people by the police or handed down to them by Congress or the courts. Order is a collaboration among all, the product of the American community. \n\nOur 21st century order is shaped by our Constitution, which demands that the laws be applied equally, justly, and humanely. In an earlier time in America, the law made some people the property of other people, the law discriminated against some, the law divided race from race. Even today, elsewhere in the world, evil things are done in the name of law. But thanks to our collaborative, Constitutional concept of order, we 21st century Americans do not use the law in these ways.\n\nThe new president-elect has never held public office, and he has never served in law enforcement. He will have his hands full. Fortunately, there is a blueprint. It is called The Final Report of the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Based on detailed interviews with hundreds of Americans from the realms of law enforcement, education, government, business, the police unions, faith and community groups, the many minorities in our diverse nation, it is the people's blueprint for modern policing. I was proud to have been appointed by President Obama to serve on the Task Force that compiled and wrote it. \n\nI call it a blueprint because it is a plan for building law and order in what is still a new century. Instead of chapters, it consists of \"pillars.\" For me, the two most important of these are \"Building Trust and Legitimacy\" and \"Community Policing and Crime Reduction.\" They are closely related. \n\nWe are a nation of laws, and the authority of all our public officials, from presidents to police officers, comes from our laws. But authority derived from statutes is not sufficient to make an effective police officer. As we note in the report we compiled, \"People are more likely to obey the law when they believe that those who are enforcing it have authority that is perceived as legitimate by those subject to the authority. The public confers legitimacy only on those whom they believe are acting in procedurally just ways.\" Procedural justice is fairness and transparency in the way the police do their job in the community, in the processes they use to resolve disputes, and in the empathy and respect they show everyone they serve and protect. \n\nLegitimacy derived from procedural justice is the aim of community policing, which must be the foundation of policing today. The community policing concept was created in the last quarter of the last century, a period during which it competed with policing policies based on military models. \n\nIn the worst cases, these models cast police and community in the role of belligerents fighting an outright and never-ending war. In our new century, the time has come to replace the war scenario with community policing as a law-enforcement approach that supports police-community partnerships and pragmatic problem-solving in which police and citizens work together to address public safety challenges ranging from social disorder, to street crime, to fear of crime.\n\nWhen it was conceived in the 20th century, community policing was focused narrowly on the neighborhood and even the beat. Years ago, when I was an officer with the Miami-Dade Police Department, we even focused community policing efforts on one single housing project, which was notorious for a level of violence that intimidated and endangered residents of the project. \n\nThe scope of 21st-century community policing expands from the intensely local to the broadly global. In our digitally interconnected world, global terrorist organizations, prominent among them ISIL (ISIS), relentlessly reach out to marginalized youth in our most challenged communities, recruiting their allegiance to the cause of terror. Today, community policing is, in part, a homeland security mission.\n\nCandidate Trump repeatedly appealed for support from African-American and Latino communities by asking them, \"What have you got to lose?\" He is now President-elect Trump, so I can understand if some think I am presumptuous in telling him that he had been asking the wrong question. But he was asking the wrong question, and, as president, he needs to start asking a different question, the right question: \"What have we got to gain?\"\n\nWhat indeed?\n\nFor the vast majority of Americans, the most visible, frequent, and important contact they have with the laws and the government of the United States are their interactions with police officers. For most Americans most of the time, police officers are the government of the United States. \n\nThe law enforcement community now includes the nation's newest Chief Magistrate, Donald Trump. Like any police officer, President Trump must earn the legitimacy of his authority to administer law and order. It is a legitimacy that can be conferred only by the people of the communities we serve and protect. Earning it is another pillar of 21st century policing. It is a pillar built on partnership, not enmity, with the community. It is built on mutual respect, empathy, and tolerance. It is built on the celebration of diversity.

He also played a decisive role in ending the conflict as he made sure Iran held its head up high even when virtually every global and regional power had supported Saddam. \n\nAfter the war, he initiated a massive reconstruction program to rebuild the country during his two terms as president between 1989 and 1997. \n\nWhen Rafsanjani was elected president, Iran was also gripped by political polarization and radicalism among its leftist and rightist political factions. He set on championing the idea of moderation as a guiding philosophy in foreign and domestic policy and fought to entrench centrism in Iranian politics -- a cause to which he remained dedicated to till his last day. \n\nI knew Ayatollah Rafsfanjani for over 30 years. I experienced firsthand how he always emphasized the importance of relations with Eastern countries such as China, Russia, and India, while at the same time ceaselessly endeavoring to improve Iran's ties with the West and decrease US-Iran tensions. \n\nAkbar Hashemi Rafsanjani: the man who mirrored an ever-changing Iran\n\nRelations with the West\n\nDespite American support for Saddam, Rafsanjani was receptive to President George HW Bush's promise that \"goodwill begets goodwill\". \n\nWhen Washington and European officials appealed to Iran to help release Western hostages trapped in Lebanon between 1982 and 1992, Rafsanjani delivered. He dispatched Mahmoud Vaezi -- now minister of communication -- and myself to engage in diplomacy that ultimately secured the release of all European and American hostages. \n\nBush, however, would not follow through on his promise and reciprocate the goodwill gesture. Despite this, Rafsanjani persisted and in 1995 offered Iran's first oil contract to a foreign firm since the revolution to the US company Conoco. Valued at over $1 billion, the contract would fall victim to an executive order by then President Bill Clinton barring it and other similar investments in Iran. \n\nRafsanjani also made every effort during his presidency to improve Iran's relations with Europe and its Arab neighbors. \n\nIn one meeting, then-German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and I discussed with Rafsanjani options for developing friendlier ties with the Persian Gulf states. Rafsanjani told Genscher that Tehran supported the establishment of a security and cooperation system among Persian Gulf countries similar to the EU. Genscher was elated and said he would notify Washington. A short while later he informed us in private that Washington opposed the idea.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1997, I served as Iran's Ambassador to Germany. The German chancellor at the time, Helmut Kohl, was eager to defuse tensions between Iran and the US. Rafsanjani welcomed Kohl's efforts and informed him that Iran was ready for cooperation on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, combating terrorism, and safeguarding human rights. \n\nWith great hope, Kohl travelled to Washington to notify US officials. Some weeks later, I was told by the chancellor's office that that Kohl had spoken with President Clinton, who strongly opposed the entire initiative. \n\nModerator\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah\u2014who was effectively already running the country as his brother's health was ailing\u2014reached out to Rafsanjani and suggested talks. Saudi-Iran ties had vastly deteriorated due to Saudi support for Saddam in the Iran-Iraq War. \n\nAlongside a son of Rafsanjani, I traveled to Riyadh and negotiated for days with the Crown Prince. The result was a series of agreements that maintained amicable ties between the two countries from 1997 until President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election in 2005. \n\nRafsanjani was a man of peace and cooperation in foreign policy and of construction and development in Iran. He worked to build a modern, progressive nation true to its history and religion while remaining at peace with its neighbors. \n\nHis most significant legacy, however, will be of ingraining a mindset of moderation and aversion to radicalism in Iran and the region. While many in the West did not comprehend this in his time, costing him dearly politically, he passed the torch to a new generation in Tehran, making it still possible to right past wrongs and reach the breakthroughs he long fought for but never lived to see.

The United States abstained on the resolution, allowing it to pass, rather than vetoing it -- as it usually does with resolutions it sees as overly critical of Israel.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned the US ambassador and launched a scathing attack Sunday on the Obama administration.\n\nHere are nine questions about the vote at the UN.\n\n1. What are the immediate effects of the UNSC resolution?\n\nThe resolution may have no immediate practical effects on Israel, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, or the peace process. That's because the resolution is non-binding, effectively creating guidelines and recommendations. The resolution would require follow-up action at the United Nations for it to have an immediate effect.\n\nIsrael is concerned about exactly that type of action. Specifically, Israel is worried about a resolution that would set conditions for negotiations. Such a resolution would issue parameters for some of the most sensitive issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including borders, the status of Jerusalem as a contested capital, Palestinian refugees, and a time-limit for negotiations.\n\nAn international peace conference in Paris scheduled for January 15 could be the forum for discussing such a resolution. That would give the international community time to introduce the resolution at the United Nations Security Council before the end of President Barack Obama's time in office. Israel has vowed not to attend the conference. The Palestinians say they will attend.\n\n2. What are the long-term effects?\n\nThe biggest blow is to Israel's settlement enterprise in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. This resolution has left little room for negotiation about the legality of the settlements, stating that Israel's settlements have \"no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.\"\n\nRELATED: US abstains as UN demands end to Israeli settlements\n\nWhen it comes to borders, the resolution does leave an opening for negotiations, saying there will be no changes to the June 4, 1967 \"other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations.\"\n\nThe resolution also calls on countries to recognize a difference between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories when dealing with Israel. That could lead to sanctions against products from Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\n\nPalestinian leaders say they will wait to see if Israel abides by the resolution. If not, they can pursue cases against Israeli leaders at the International Criminal Court (ICC) under the Geneva Convention. The ICC is already conducting an ongoing investigation into Israeli actions in the Palestinian territories.\n\n3. Will President-elect Donald Trump be able to repeal the resolution?\n\nTheoretically, yes, the incoming administration could repeal this resolution. Trump would have to introduce a new resolution that revokes this one entirely. Then he would need at least nine countries to vote for it and ensure that none of the Security Council's other permanent members -- Russia, UK, France, and China -- vetoed it.\n\nRealistically, that is incredibly unlikely to happen. There is a broad international consensus that settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are illegal and that they constitute an obstacle to peace. It is extremely unlikely that Trump would be able to find eight other nations on the Security Council willing to support revoking the new resolution. Even if he did, a permanent member veto is likely.\n\n4. Will the US and Israel take diplomatic action against the UN?\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, has threatened to cut US money to the United Nations over this resolution. The US currently provides 22% of the UN's budget.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that Israel will cut funding to five different UN organizations, totaling nearly $8 million. Netanyahu said Israel would reevaluate its relationships with UN representatives in Israel.\n\n5. What about Israel's diplomatic actions against the countries that voted for this resolution? What are the effects of those?\n\nOn Christmas Day, one day after the Security Council vote, Israel summoned the ambassadors of the United States and 10 of the countries that voted for the resolution to express his disappointment about the vote. Netanyahu followed that up by limiting working ties and high-level visits with the embassies of those countries who voted for the resolution and instructing his ministers to limit travel to those countries.\n\nMore than anything else, the intent of these diplomatic steps was to make a statement about how angry Netanyahu was about the vote. The decision to suspend working ties with embassies, even if there is no date for resuming those ties, is largely symbolic and has little practical effect on the relations between the nations. It does not affect trade, security cooperation, or other aspects of the relations.\n\nNotably, Netanyahu did not suspend working ties with the American embassy, even though most of his anger was directly at President Barack Obama.\n\n6. Is this the first UNSC resolution regarding settlements?\n\nNo, but it is the first resolution directly addressing Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1980. Resolution 465, passed on March 1, 1980, condemned \"the decision of the Government of Israel to officially support Israeli settlement in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967.\"\n\nOther Security Council resolutions relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been passed, but none addressed settlements.\n\n7. Is this the first time an American president has taken action on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his final days in office?\n\nNo. In fact, it's not all that uncommon. In 1988, Ronald Reagan began dialogue with the PLO before the end of his second term. In 2000, Bill Clinton laid out his vision for peace, now known as the \"Clinton Parameters.\" And in 2008, George W. Bush's envoy voted in favor of Security Council resolution 1850, which called for a renewal of the peace process.\n\n8. Is this the first time an American president has declined to use his veto at the Security Council?\n\nNo, other presidents have either declined to use their veto power or voted in favor of Security Council resolutions related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But it is the first time President Barack Obama has declined to use his veto. Obama has exercised the veto power of the United States at the Security Council on every other resolution relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nRELATED: Israel summons US ambassador as Netanyahu lashes out at Obama\n\nMost notably, he vetoed a 2011 Security Council resolution that was critical of settlements. At the time, US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice said, \"We reject in the strongest terms the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlement activity.\" But, she added, \"This draft resolution risks hardening the positions of both sides. It could encourage the parties to stay out of negotiations.\"\n\nIn abstaining from this vote and allowing the resolution to pass, current US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said, \"It is precisely our commitment to Israel's security that makes the United States believe that we cannot stand in the way of this resolution as we seek to preserve a chance of attaining our longstanding objective: two states living side-by-side in peace and security.\"\n\n9. So why all the Israeli criticism pointed at President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry?\n\nBecause this is the first Security Council resolution in more than 35 years to deal with Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The resolution lays out guidelines for dealing with the settlements, which is something no US President has done at the Security Council since 1980.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.9790661334991495, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1137, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 7.361952669460001, "HarmVirtue": 23, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 23, "mft_sum": 52, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227010000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.57343887423043, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.72727272727}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/trump-travel-ban-britain-world-reaction/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 770, "scraper_regex": 1194}}, "headline": "British diplomats, Muslim figures condemn Trump's travel ban", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1194, "date": "20170129210000", "story_content": "Diplomats and prominent Muslims in Britain have condemned US President Donald Trump's decision to temporarily ban all refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\n\nTheir criticisms come awkwardly just two days after UK Prime Minister Theresa May officially met with Trump, the first foreign leader to do so, touting the two countries' \"special relationship.\"\n\nTrump on Friday signed an executive order banning citizens from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan from entering the United States for the next 90 days and suspending the admission of all refugees for 120 days.\n\nOn Friday, Trump and May celebrated their countries' \"special relationship\" as they walked through the White House colonnade outside the Oval Office, trading grins and sideways glances, and buttoning up agreements on NATO and trade in front of reporters.

He was elected to say he would do everything in his power to protect America from infiltration by ISIS terrorists. There are seven countries on that list. He is entitled to do this.

She is convinced that the necessary fight against terrorism does not justify to place people of certain nationalities or beliefs under general suspicion,\" Seibert said.\n\nMerkel has herself come under scrutiny in Germany for her open-door refugee policy. In 2015, the country took in more than a million Syrian refugees. Her policy has been criticized after several terror attacks in Germany since the mass intake. \n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that welcoming of refugees was \"a duty of solidarity.\" \n\n\"Terrorism doesn't have a nationality; discrimination is not an answer,\" he said on Twitter.  \n\nCloser to home, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau defended the importance of welcoming refugees, without explicitly referring to Trump's executive order. \n\nHe said that those fleeing persecution, terror and war were welcome in Canada.\n\nTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith.

Clashes broke out between the government and soldiers loyal to the former vice president. \n\nThousands have been killed in the ensuing violence and the UN estimates more than 2 million have been displaced. Despite a series of failed talks and ceasefires the fighting continues. \n\n\"I think I can add more to society in South Sudan,\" De Garang told CNN. \"Here I'm not just spending all my money on an expensive lifestyle as I would in the UK. I love Africa's openness.\"\n\nOn the 9th July 2012, the first anniversary of South Sudan's independence, De Garang held the first edition of the festival.\n\n\"It was challenging and exciting,\" she said. \"The whole team of volunteers was passionate as this was a unique, unprecedented event.\" \n\n\"It's not cheap to hire in Juba. We had to build our own runway from scratch, we bought our own tent. The economic situation has become really difficult. Inflation is high.\"\n\nThe first edition was a success with 300 people from different communities in attendance. \n\nThese days the festival is still a community affair, with different people pitching in to help. The event includes an arts and crafts market, a range of performances and poetry readings, traditional dances and a fashion show that features local and regional designers and world renowned models like Manuela Modong and Atong DeMach. \n\nA curfew  followed by a restriction on movement meant the  festival didn't take place last year but De Garang hopes the 2017 edition will be better than ever, but things don't come easy in a conflict zone. \n\nA few of the artisan groups involved in the festival were displaced and can't be traced, inflation now stands at 450 per cent , and the threat of violence looms. \n\n\"In July [2016] people were evacuated, everybody was on the edge, no one knew what would happen,\" she said.  \"So it wasn't a good idea to bring a group of people in one place.

Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin -- the balance of power in the chamber could tilt further to the GOP. So they are making the case to their colleagues to stay put.\n\n\"I certainly hope they stay with us,\" Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told CNN on Monday. \"We need them. America needs them. Although they are qualified to be Cabinet officials, I would not recommend it to them.\"\n\nAt a private caucus meeting last Thursday, incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told his colleagues that he didn't have any issues with them having private conversations with Trump. But in the wake of news that Heitkamp planned to meet with Trump the next day, he urged them to keep him and his caucus informed of any commitments they planned to make with the new president.\n\n\"Sen. Schumer has told his colleagues there is nothing wrong with an open dialogue with the incoming administration,\" said Schumer spokesman Matt House. \"We hope they'll keep the caucus informed of those discussions.\"\n\nThe discussion comes at an urgent time for Democrats. After a disappointing election cycle where they failed to regain the Senate majority, the party will likely only have 48 seats in the new Congress. And in the 2018 election cycle, Democrats face a daunting map, with the battle for control of the chamber running squarely through a spate of red states that Trump won overwhelmingly.\n\nIf Manchin and Heitkamp were to leave for the Trump administration, the GOP would have a clear shot to pick up the open seats in 2018. In West Virginia, the Democratic governor, Earl Ray Tomblin, would fill the open seat until the next election in the red state. And in North Dakota, a special election would occur within 95 days of the vacancy, giving the GOP an immediate chance to grow their numbers in the first year under Trump.\n\nManchin would not rule out taking a job with Trump, telling CNN, \"We have not talked specifics at all.\"\n\nAsked if he were concerned about giving the GOP a chance to pick up his seat, Manchin pushed back.\n\n\"The people of West Virginia sent me here,\" Manchin said Monday. \"I got to do what I can to make sure I'm helping my people.\"\n\nSince her Friday meeting, Heitkamp said she has had followup conversations with Trump's incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus. But Heitkamp declined to comment further Monday.\n\n\"We've had follow-on conversations; there's really nothing to say beyond that,\" Heitkamp said.\n\nIt's unclear how serious Trump is taking the possibility of naming Manchin and Heitkamp to his Cabinet, but speculation has centered around the Democrats possibly being up for energy-related Cabinet jobs in the administration. Heitkamp met with Trump last Friday in Trump Tower, while Manchin plans to meet with the President-elect later this week after speaking by the phone with him last week.\n\n\"I always believed public officials must put their state and country first and set aside partisan politics to do what's right for the people they serve,\" Manchin said in a statement.\n\nDurbin added that the move appears motivated by Senate Republican leaders, including Mitch McConnell, to add to their numbers in the chamber.\n\n\"I think it's a pretty shrewd move,\" Durbin said Monday. \"I imagine Sen. McConnell has a hand in this strategy, which is to remove candidates who are odds-on favorites in red states. ... I think part of the strategy is for the Republicans to pick up a few more seats in the Senate.\"\n\nSen. Ben Cardin of Maryland said that the Trump move to court his colleagues puts Democrats in an awkward position since they believe Manchin and Heitkamp would ultimately be a moderating force for the incoming administration.\n\n\"That would be very difficult for us,\" Cardin said of losing either of the two senators to the Trump administration. \"It's a mixed message for us. Clearly they are great members but (losing them) would present additional challenges, which is probably one of the reasons why the President-elect is looking at these particular members.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.8635578751564029, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 552, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.42004539562, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4492753623188401, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/africa/boko-haram-survivors-sexually-abused-hrw/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 692, "scraper_regex": 798}}, "headline": "Boko Haram survivors sexually abused by government officials at 'safe' camps", "wordcount_as_scraped": 798, "date": "20161102100000", "story_content": "Women and girls who survived Boko Haram violence were raped by government officials at camps in northern Nigeria where they sought safety, according to a new rights group report.\n\nDozens of victims who stayed at camps for the displaced in Borno State's capital Maiduguri told Human Rights Watch they were sexually abused or coerced into sex by camp leaders, vigilante group members, policemen and soldiers.

We will act decisively on the findings of the investigations.\u2014 Muhammadu Buhari (@MBuhari) October 31, 2016\n\n'I did not tell anyone because I was afraid'\n\nIn its report published Monday, HRW documented the accounts of 43 women and girls, who had been displaced from several towns and villages in Borno State.\n\nEight women were previously abducted by Boko Haram fighters and forced into marriage before escaping to Maiduguri. Four victims told Human Rights Watch they were first drugged before they were raped at the camps. The rights groups said 37 of the victims were coerced into sex through false marriage promises, material and financial help, even food.\n\nA 16-year-old girl from Baga said she was drugged and raped by a vigilante group member, who was in charge of distributing aid at one of the camps.\n\n\"I always told him I was too small [young],\" she said. \"The day he raped me, he offered me a drink in a cup. As soon as I drank it, I slept off.\"\n\n\"I knew something was wrong when I woke up. I was in pain, and blood was coming out of my private part,\" said the girl. \"I did not tell anyone, because I was afraid.\"\n\nA 30-year-old woman from Walassa fled to a camp with her remaining children, after Boko Haram fighters killed her husband and abducted her young daughters. She said one of the soldiers at the camp approached her for marriage.\n\n\"When he was pretending to woo me he used to provide for me, but as soon as I agreed and we began having sex, his gifts began to reduce until he abandoned me,\" she said. \"Now my situation is worse as the pregnancy makes me sick, and I have no one to help me care for my children.\"\n\nMany victims ashamed\n\nHRW says irregular supplies of food, clothes, medicine and other essentials for the displaced, along with restricted movement are factors contributing to the vulnerability of the victims, who are often widowed women and unaccompanied orphaned girls.\n\nRape and sexual abuse victims are less likely to seek health care, including psychological counseling, because of the shame they feel, the rights group said. Fewer than a handful of the 43 interviewed women and girls said they had received counseling. Many other victims are suspected to be infected with HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases but are ashamed to seek treatment.\n\n\"Failure to respond to these widely reported abuses amounts to severe negligence or worse by Nigerian authorities,\" said Segun. \"Authorities should provide adequate aid in the camps, ensure freedom of movement for all displaced people, safe and confidential health care for survivors, and punish the abusers.\"\n\nBoko Haram blamed for humanitarian crisis\n\nYears of Boko Haram violence in northern Nigeria have taken a heavy toll on the region and its residents. Efforts by the government and aid groups to alleviate the humanitarian crisis have shown slow progress.\n\nBoko Haram aims to institute Sharia law across the country and is fighting with government forces who are trying to put down its deadly insurgency.   \n\nMore than 20,000 people have been killed in the violence, thousands abducted and nearly 2.5 million displaced.\n\nIn 2014, Boko Haram fighters abducted nearly 300 girls from a school in Chibok, prompting a global campaign for their release. While some of the girls have escaped or have been rescued, many of the remaining girls are believed to be still held by the terror group.\n\nRead the report", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.02917766571045, "HarmVice": 18, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 692, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.92589715787, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 45, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161102100000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.090909090909999, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 6.5028901734104005, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/opinions/comey-hits-pause-button-callan/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Hillary Clinton email story likely far from over", "wordcount_as_scraped": 952, "date": "20161108020000", "story_content": "FBI Director James Comey on Sunday issued a third highly unusual statement regarding the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, returning to the original theme of exoneration first proffered in July. Democrats breathed a sigh of relief. But how did we get here? And can Team Clinton really relax?\n\nThe sorry history of the email saga leads directly back to the tarmac of Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport on June 27, 2016, when Bill Clinton decided to pay a surprise visit to his old friend Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The runway visit was by all accounts staggeringly improper. Lynch was then the chief law enforcement official in charge of an investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server. \n\nAccording to Lynch, she and the former president only discussed \"grandchildren and golf.\" To her credit, the attorney general immediately recognized that the Clinton visit to her plane was an ethical and public relations disaster. She quite sensibly opted to distance herself from the decision-making with respect to the Hillary Clinton investigation. However, in a strange move, she ceded supervisory and decision-making responsibility concerning the email investigation directly to the FBI (a move she suggested had already been planned).\n\nIn Washington's chain of command, the Justice Department exercises supervisory responsibility over the FBI. It is the Justice Department, not the FBI, that customarily makes the final decision regarding the commencement or termination of a criminal prosecution based upon the evidence gathered by the FBI. Yet while this was an extraordinary and unusual transfer of power from the Justice Department to its federal police arm, the FBI, Lynch had substantial reason to respect the integrity and judgment of Comey. After all, he had previously served as the United States attorney for New York's Southern District and as deputy attorney general of the United States from 2003-2005. \n\nGiven his sterling credentials, it is astonishing that Comey would later violate Justice Department protocols by making a number of public statements on the ongoing investigation. Comey asserted that he was protecting the FBI's reputation for straight shooting and integrity, but this attempt at \"transparency\" and \"openness\" has been a disaster. \n\nComey first issued a surprise announcement in July firmly suggesting Clinton's exoneration, prompting Trump and his supporters to cry foul and suggest the process was \"rigged\" in favor of Clinton. Democrats praised Comey's fairness and integrity. \n\nThose accolades turned to dust when, on October 28, Comey announced the discovery of what later would be revealed to be perhaps tens of thousands of emails potentially relevant to the investigation. Enter former congressman and serial sexter Anthony Weiner, aka \"Carlos Danger,\" the husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The FBI sent a letter to Congress saying that in a separate investigation of Weiner it had discovered the emails on a device the couple shared, a decision by Comey that elicited howls of protest from Democrats.\n\nBut one more bizarre development remained.\n\nJust two days before the presidential election, Comey made unusual public announcement number three, stating that his hardworking agents had somehow (dare I say miraculously?) examined the new material and found nothing to change its view that Hillary Clinton should not face criminal charges. \n\nThe FBI must have quite an algorithm to conclude this review so swiftly.\n\nRegardless, as the election proceeds Tuesday, American voters will undoubtedly be shaking their heads about the whole sorry mess they have witnessed. And they have good reason to do so; the FBI's public announcements regarding the results of an incomplete investigation interfered in the campaign by first suggesting the exoneration of Clinton, then hinting at possible concerns, then clearing her again. \n\nResponsible prosecutors wait until an investigation is over and/or the statute of limitations has run before issuing public pronouncements. New evidence often changes the course of an investigation, sometimes leading to the exoneration, sometimes leading to incarceration. When prosecutors truly seek justice, rather than headlines, silence is almost always the best policy while investigators gather the facts.\n\nAnd the reality is that the Hillary Clinton email story is far from over. The FBI initially failed to examine such an obvious source of relevant information as Anthony Weiner's computer. With that in mind, how many other devices are unexamined? Huma Abedin was reportedly surprised that  relevant emails were discovered on Weiner's computer. But Huma married a congressman who at one point was the front-runner in the New York mayoral race. I think it is safe to assume that this political couple would exchange emails about politics! So, if the FBI couldn't figure out that basic connection, it raises the question of how many other gaps exist in the probe.\n\nAll this suggests a turbulent post-election period with calls for impeachment of whomever is elected. Whether a president can be impeached for \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" committed prior to an election is an interesting legal question that undoubtedly will be the subject of future debate and discussion. And there is also the question of whether a president can pardon her or himself. Plus, it is still unclear whether the FBI sees the Clinton investigation as finished, or more likely has just pushed the pause button. \n\nFinally, this is not just about Clinton -- if Abedin doubts potential legal peril, she need only look at what happened to Chris Christie's former aides in the Bridgegate scandal. The jury has just handed down convictions while Christie has continued to work unscathed for Team Trump. A coverup and lying to the FBI are often the crimes that survive when evidence of all else shrivels on the vine.  \n\nIn short, whoever wins Tuesday, one thing should be clear -- those who think our long national misery will finally be over with the election of a new president need to think again.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.7699115276336699, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 940, "FairnessVirtue": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.1465578727, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161108020000, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 8, "pct_mft_words": 3.4042553191489398, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/comey-republicans-hacked-russia/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1709, 1832, 1931]}}, "headline": "FBI's Comey: Republicans also hacked by Russia", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1148, "date": "20170111000000", "story_content": "Top intelligence officials indicated on Tuesday that the GOP was also a Russian hacking target but that none of the information obtained was leaked.\n\nFBI director James Comey told a Senate panel that there was \"penetration on the Republican side of the aisle and old Republican National Committee domains\" no longer in use. Republicans have previously denied their organizations were hacked. \n\nThe testimony came in a Senate intelligence committee hearing that examined Russia's intrusions in the 2016 election campaign and its intentions, with America's top intelligence officials testifying just days after they released an unclassified report blaming Moscow for the hacks. \n\nComey later added that \"there was evidence of hacking directed at state-level organizations, state-level campaigns, and the RNC, but old domains of the RNC, meaning old emails they weren't using. None of that was released.\"\n\nComey said there was no sign \"that the Trump campaign or the current RNC was successfully hacked.\"\n\nAsked by Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, whether the hacker had the ability to selectively leak that old information, Comey indicated that they did.\n\nComey also said that the Russians \"got far deeper and wider into the (Democratic National Committee) than the RNC,\" adding that \"similar techniques were used in both cases.\" \n\nComey said the FBI would have preferred to \"get access to the original device or server\" that was the target of hacking at the DNC. CNN previously reported that the Democratic National Committee \"rebuffed\" a request from the FBI to examine its computer services after it was allegedly hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.\u00a0 \n\nThe FBI instead relied on the assessment of a third-party security company called CrowdStrIke. Comey told senators that\u00a0the \"highly respected private company eventually got access and shared\" the evidence with the FBI.\u00a0\n\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate committee, examining the cyber breaches, that the intelligence community concluded with \"high confidence\" that Russia hacked the election to \"denigrate\" Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and contrast her unfavorably to Republican Donald Trump.\n\n\"We have multiple high-quality sources that contribute to that assessment,\" Clapper said. \"Attributing cyber operations is difficult but not impossible.\" \n\nWhen Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton asked whether Russian President Vladimir Putin thought Trump was going to be the likely winner, Clapper responded, \"Initially, no. They thought he was a fringe candidate and didn't think that at all.\" \n\nClapper said the intelligence community's report on the hacking was based on a variety of sources, including technical data, open-source information and human sources as well. He declined to offer more detail on how the information was collection in order to protect sources.\n\nCIA Director John Brennan said that had called the director of a Russian intelligence agency behind the hacks and warned the Russians that they were playing with fire, a message the Russian said he'd pass on to Putin. \n\nClapper said that the response to activist attacks of this sort has to be carefully considered. \n\n\"It's not our call what to do in response,\" he said of the intelligence community. He said that policy makers and politicians should \"consider the whole range of tools to respond.\"\n\n\"The challenge you get into with cyber for cyber, of course, you also have to consider the counter-retaliation to that,\" Clapper said. \"While we spend a lot of time worrying about precision and being surgical, our adversaries\" might not be that careful.\n\nClapper was asked whether intelligence agencies had found that people close to Trump had business interests that would make the Russians predisposed to favor Trump.\n\n\"The Russians just believed, or came to the conclusion, that because the President-elect is a businessman, that he would be easier to make deals with than the Democrats,\" Clapper said.\n\nThere were frequent questions about ties between the Trump campaign and Russia during the hearing. Earlier on, Comey refused to comment on whether the FBI is investigating any potential connections.\n\n\"I would never comment on investigations,\" Comey told Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who repeatedly pushed the FBI director to release any information it had before Inauguration Day.\n\n\"If it doesn't happen before Jan. 20, I'm not sure it's going to happen,\" Wyden said. \n\nBut Sen. Angus King of Maine, an Independent, alluded tartly to Comey's very public statements about investigations into Clinton during the election campaign -- \"the irony of you making that statement I cannot avoid.\"\n\nComey said that there was a difference between open and closed investigations. He pushed back on King, saying, \"You asked me if you have any pending investigations and we're not going to talk about that.\"\n\nHe added that \"I'm tone deaf on politics and that's as it should be.\"  \n\nTuesday's hearing is the first public examination of Russia's activities since Trump received a briefing from the country's top intelligence officials on Moscow's interference in the presidential election. \n\nThe 17 US intelligence agencies already issued a statement in October expressing their unanimous assessment that Moscow had probed state election voting centers and penetrated the email accounts of Democratic groups and individuals. Much of that information was made public through the organization WikiLeaks, lead by Julian Assange.  \n\nIn the classified and declassified reports released last week, they outlined their findings that Putin directly ordered the \"influence campaign.\" \n\nRepublicans and Democrats both called for a thorough investigation into Russia's hacking of the presidential election Tuesday, reaffirming their confidence in US intelligence agencies' findings even as Trump has continued to downplay them. \n\nThe report \"gives me no reason to doubt the findings,\" said the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, North Carolina Republican Richard Burr. \"We owe it to the American people to do an independent and bipartisan review.\" \n\nAfter the conclusion of the public session, Burr said that the hearing would continue in a classified setting. \n\nCongressional Democrats are pushing for a bipartisan, independent commission to look into the hacks. California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said last week that she and other senators will soon introduce a similar bill, while House lawmakers introduced one in early December and re-introduced it again last week. \n\nRepublicans have preferred to limit investigations to congressional committees they control. On Tuesday, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, California's Adam Schiff, said \"the seriousness of these allegations warrant the most thorough and non-partisan of investigations.\" \n\nAnother California Democrat on the committee, Eric Swalwell, said the \"best way forward is to have an independent, bipartisan commission that can depoliticize this. The Democrats were the victims this time,\" but \"it could be the Republicans next time. The constant should be that both parties care about our democracy. There's plenty of room for Republicans to come on board.\" \n\nIn the final run-up to Nov. 9, Russia shifted its focus from influencing the campaign to undermining the validity of the results, a theme that Trump himself began to stress on the campaign trail, telling people the election was going to be \"rigged.\" ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.3300082683563201, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1124, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.3105936413, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.51245551601423, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/18/middleeast/jordan-shootout-security/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 584, "scraper_regex": 651}}, "headline": "Jordan says 10 killed in 'cowardly terrorist attack'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 651, "date": "20161219050000", "story_content": "Ten people were killed and 34 were wounded Sunday in what a Jordanian official called a \"cowardly terrorist attack.\"\n\nAfter firing at police officers at two locations, gunmen moved into an ancient castle popular with tourists in the city of Karak, Jordan's Public Service Directorate said. \n\nSecurity forces surrounded the castle and an hourslong standoff occurred.

Trump made immigration a top focal point from the moment he launched his White House bid in June of 2015, when he controversially claimed that Mexico was sending \"rapists\" and \"criminals\" across the border. \n\nThe wall, which Trump has promised will be \"beautiful,\" was the centerpiece of his immigration policy. He insisted that Mexico would pay for its construction, although he didn't broach the subject when he met with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in August. \n\nMany Democratic and more moderate voters have voiced opposition to the wall, but the proposal is wildly popular among Trump's backers. Seventy-nine percent of his supporters said they favor building a wall along the entire US-Mexico border, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\n'Lock her up'\n\nThe chants began during the Republican National Convention. Soon, \"lock her up\" became a ritual at each of Trump's rallies. And at the second presidential debate, Trump told Hillary Clinton that, were he to win, he would \"instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your (missing email) situation.\"  \n\nClinton responded by saying it's \"just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\" \n\nTrump shot back: \"Because you'd be in jail.\" \n\nMany political observers on the left and the right were troubled by Trump's comment, but his supporters ate it up. \n\nFBI Director James Comey said over the weekend that Clinton should not face criminal charges over a review of emails linked to her time as secretary of state, reaffirming the agency's findings over the summer. But Trump's vow to revisit the matter became a main theme of his closing argument, and one not likely to be forgotten by his supporters.\n\nMuslim ban\n\nAlmost a year ago, following the massacre in San Bernardino, California, Trump issued perhaps his most dramatic proposal: \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" \n\nThe proposal has morphed in the 11 months since then, making it difficult to identify Trump's exact position on the matter. He eventually said the ban applied to immigration \"from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism,\" though his original pledge remains outlined on his campaign website. \n\nJust last month, Trump's running mate Mike Pence, who called the original proposal \"offensive and unconstitutional,\" said that Trump no longer supports an outright ban on Muslims entering the US. But Republicans seem to believe Trump had it right the first time. Exit poll data from earlier this year found wide majorities of GOP primary voters in support of a temporary ban against Muslims from entering the country.\n\nRepeal Obamacare\n\nRepublicans have been trying to repeal President Obama's signature health care law pretty much from the moment it was signed in 2010. Now the GOP will finally have someone in the White House to finish the job. \n\nTrump has hammered the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, calling it a \"disaster\" and vowing to replace it with \"the finest health care plan there is.\" \n\nThe law has had its share of setbacks, the most recent of which was the announcement that premiums are set to skyrocket in 2017.  \n\nThe prospect of undoing Obamacare will excite even the Republicans who were lukewarm toward Trump's candidacy. House Speaker Paul Ryan said last week that, despite his misgivings with Trump, he nevertheless voted for the GOP nominee in part because of the opportunity to get rid of the health care law. Trump is now armed with a Republican House and Senate eager to repeal, though that would entail kicking up to 20 million people off health insurance.\n\nUnravel NAFTA and TPP\n\nTrump's improbable win on Tuesday was driven in large part by his triumph in the Rust Belt, with states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania going to the GOP for the first time since the 1980s, and Trump leading in a third, Michigan. He inspired voters there with a populist message on free trade, promising to return their communities to the golden years by scrapping what he described as horrible deals for workers.\n\nThe two deals in question, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), gave Trump an opening with Rust Belt voters  -- and proved to be a political weak spot for Clinton. She came out against TPP, which is opposed by many Democrats, after previously describing the measure as a \"gold standard\" -- a shift for which Trump took credit. And Clinton's position on NAFTA, which was signed into law by her husband former President Bill Clinton, was difficult to pin down. \n\nIn contrast, Trump has been resolute in his opposition to both. He has vowed to renegotiate the terms of NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, leaving open the possibility of pulling out entirely, and has said he will not approve TPP as president.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.1113585755229, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 842, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.7242407388700003, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161109120000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.85035629453682, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/01/politics/donald-trump-mike-pence-obamacare-health-care/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Trump, Pence pitch Obamacare repeal a week from election", "wordcount_as_scraped": 600, "date": "20161101190000", "story_content": "Donald Trump ceded the floor Tuesday to his running mate, Indiana Gov.

The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment seeking clarification.\n\nBut while both Pence and Trump sought to raise the stakes of the election by painting the health care law as disastrous to the US economy and Americans' pocketbooks, neither offered any significant new details to flesh out how their replacement plan will affect Americans' health insurance.\n\nTrump and Pence reissued their calls to eliminate barriers to encourage competition between health insurers across state lines, make it easier for Americans to open health savings accounts and block grant Medicaid funds to the states. And while they vowed an immediate repeal of the law Pence called a \"catastrophic failure,\" the vice presidential candidate vowed a phased rollback of the government subsidies established under Obamacare aimed at lowering health care costs and promised to continue to \"protect Americans with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nTheir push here in the all-important suburbs of Philadelphia comes after the government announced soaring Obamacare premiums last week. The cost of the benchmark plan is set to rise 22% next year, a sticker shock that Trump and Pence hope will work to their advantage. \n\nPence highlighted the fact that premiums were skyrocketing 116% in Arizona, 63% in Tennessee and 53% in Pennsylvania. He did not note that 85% of Obamacare enrollees will be shielded from these price hikes by federal subsidies.\n\nSpeaking the same day enrollment in health care exchanges opened for the coming year, Pence spent much of his nearly half-hour-long speech decrying the spate of premium increases the government announced last week.\n\n\"Obamacare is a catastrophic failure and Hillary Clinton says she wants to double down on that failure,\" Pence said, even though Clinton has argued for reforming Obamacare to lower some of the climbing consumer costs brought on by the health care law.\n\nTrump, taking the stage soon after his running mate, addressed Obamacare and his health care reform plans for just six minutes, most of which he spent decrying the soaring costs of premiums for Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act health care exchanges.\n\n\"She wants to put the government in charge of health care in America,\" Trump said, mischaracterizing his opponent's plans. \"If we don't repeal and replace Obamacare, we will destroy American health care forever.\"\n\nBoth Trump and Pence also blamed Obamacare for hurting the economy, with Trump saying \"workers' hours were being cut, hiring is frozen and wages are being slashed,\" despite several analyses having shown this is not the case.\n\nTrump then briefly ticked down his plans for a replacement, which he has previously vowed will be \"terrific\" and \"much better\" than Obamacare.\n\nTrump was also joined by a group of members of Congress who are also physicians -- including Sen.

Dreamers say they want a path towards citizenship and they are gearing up before Inauguration Day. \n\n\"We are a force to be reckoned with,\" Karina Solano Suarez told CNN.  \"I think he should be preparing himself for this sort of fight, for us trying to stay together with our parents and our community members.\" \n\nSolano Suarez, 20, arrived to Chicago when she was two years old. Memories of her native Mexico and of crossing the southern border escape her. She was too young to remember the arduous journey to Illinois, she said. \n\nShe is currently a sophomore at Northeastern Illinois University, studying computer science and justice studies. But most of her life was spent being afraid, she remembers, because of her undocumented status. People would make comments. She would internalize the pain. She would stay quiet, she said. \n\n\"I felt that there was a lot of negative connotations with not being a US citizen,\" Solano Suarez said. \n\nThen came DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, President Obama's 2012 executive action on immigration. It offered youth like Karina a work permit and a temporary stay in exchange for coming out of the shadows.   \n\nSolano Suarez said it was frightening to share her address with the federal government. Getting a background check and letting immigration know she was undocumented was nerve-racking. But after getting her work permit in the mail and getting a job at King Caf\u00e9 in downtown Chicago, the uneasy feeling began to fade, she said. \n\n\"I felt a sense of empowerment from this movement that is undocumented, unafraid or coming out of the shadows,\" Solano Suarez said.  \n\nSolano Suarez and other Dreamers are digging in their heels, participating in protests around the country and seeking advice from attorneys on the best ways to fight against Trump's campaign promises. \n\n\"We are preparing for the worst-case scenario,\" immigration attorney Lam Ho, founder of the Community Activism Law Alliance, told CNN. \"We are preparing so that we can respond both legally and through community activism to challenge the policies that we expect [Trump] will implement.\" \n\nCNN's 2016 national exit polls showed that 70 percent of people agreed undocumented immigrants working in the US should be offered legal status. Only a quarter of all voters said undocumented immigrants should be deported. \n\nIt's a fight that puts the President-elect in a tight political position because Trump's supporter base elected him in part because of his promise to deport undocumented immigrants and build a border wall. \n\n\"Donald Trump is really between a rock and a hard place here,\" said CNN Political Director David Chalian. \"Because his supporters during the campaign -- one of the things that thrust him into the Oval Office was their fervent desire for a really tough on immigration position.\" \n\nTrump's mixed messages on immigration has Dreamers very worried in the lead up to Inauguration Day.   \n\nIn recent weeks Trump appeared to soften his tone about Dreamers to Time Magazine when saying \"We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud.\" \n\nBut his appointment of immigration hardliner Jeff Sessions as attorney general has immigrants fearing that the incoming administration will make good on its promise to implement mass deportation -- even on historically low priority Dreamers like Solano Suarez. \n\n\"I don't trust him because he thinks very little of us. He made that very clear from the beginning of the campaign,\" Solano Suarez said. \"I don't know if he will try to build up that trust or will he try to bring us down.\" \n\nHo started CALA in 2014 as a way to unite lawyers, activists and communities to push for access to justice and social change. He has been advising Dreamers to seek legal counsel, to have a lawyer study their individual case and, if need be, to stay away from the purview of immigration agents.   \n\nDreamers, Ho said, are speaking out and are not afraid to put up a fight because they were educated in US schools that taught them to stand up for themselves. \n\n\"That is what being an American is about, standing up for your rights, standing up for the rights of your community, standing up for the rights of all people who are disadvantaged,\" Ho said. \n\nAlso empowering Dreamers, Ho said, the support from strangers and politicians who are willing to stand up with them. After the election, Ho said, CALA's phones started ringing off the hook, dozens of lawyers, students and regular people asking what they could do to help Dreamers and other immigrants. \n\n\"We have a long list of lawyers suddenly, who were sitting in their corporate offices thinking 'this is something that I need to do.  I can't just worry about the mergers and acquisitions, human beings and their lives are being severely threatened by this election',\" Ho said. \n\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is also standing up for Dreamers and other immigrants in the city when he re-affirmed Chicago is and will be a 'sanctuary city' - which welcomes all immigrants. Emanuel pledged and city council recently approved the budget for a $1.3 million legal defense fund that is expected to assist thousands of immigrants with legal services. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced a similar effort in his city.\n\nIf the President-elect -indeed allows Dreamers to stay in America - Karina worries that the move will separate Dreamers from their parents.  Her household for example is made up of DACA recipients, US citizens and undocumented immigrants.\n\n\"If [Dreamers] are protected and [undocumented parents] are not we are going to be in a situation where we either leave with them or we stay by ourselves,\" Solano Suarez told CNN. \n\nIt's the fear of being separated from their parents, Karina said, that is driving Dreamers to push for comprehensive immigration reform -- and not just for a path towards citizenship for themselves. \n\n\"If I had the chance to speak to Donald Trump I would tell him we are here to stay,\" Solano Suarez said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.281690150499344, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 978, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.31409285607, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 19, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 5, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 62, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.33946830265849, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 5.6363636363600005}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/europe/italy-referendum-matteo-renzi/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00c9": [2550], "\u00e9": [2554], "\u00e4": [3035], "\u00e7": [2445]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 887, "scraper_regex": 958}}, "headline": "Italy: Renzi's resignation delayed after meeting with President", "wordcount_as_scraped": 958, "date": "20161205130000", "story_content": "Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi met with Italy's President Sergio Mattarella on Monday to offer his resignation.

There is the possibility, for example, that a caretaker administration could be appointed to keep the country running until the 2018 elections.\n\nThat could see the likes of finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan or even Pietro Grasso, the Senate leader, take over as prime minister.\n\nAnd while unlikely, there is also a scenario in which the Italian Parliament is dissolved and a snap election is called. \n\nEurope reacts\n\nAs Europe awoke to the result, leading figures began to react to the latest installment of political change.\n\nOutgoing French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande paid tribute to Renzi and his attempt to pass \"courageous reforms.\" \n\nA statement from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said that Hollande shared Renzi's will to \"steer Europe to growth and employment.\"\n\nIn Brussels, European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs Pierre Moscovici said he remained convinced the Italian authorities would deal with the situation.\n\n\"Italy is a strong country, a reliable country,\" he said, adding that he did not expect an economic crisis.\n\nHe also insisted the result was not an anti-Europe or an anti-EU vote.\n\nGerman Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble added that he expected Italy to \"make the best of it,\" while president of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, rejected accusations that the result would radically affect the economic situation within the country.\n\nWhat was it all about?\n\nAt its core, this vote was a referendum on whether or not Italy should amend its 1948 constitution.\n\nRenzi wanted to reduce the power of the Senato, the upper chamber of the Italian Parliament, by slashing its numbers from 315 to 100 -- making it more of a consultative assembly. \n\nProponents of the referendum said that the goal was to make the job of governing Italy less complicated and that the reforms would help revive the nation's lethargic economy.\n\nHowever, critics claimed the reforms would impact the constitution's checks and balances and give the prime minister too much power.\n\nElly Schlein, an Italian member of the European Parliament, said the proposed reforms would have transferred too much power into the hands of the ruling party.\n\n\"It was shifting power from the regions to the center in a really unbalanced way,\" she said. \"It was a dangerous reform for the roots of our democratic system.\"\n\nHowever, the referendum was widely considered a litmus test for the rising wave of populism spreading in Europe, and the chance to register discontent with the current government.\n\nThis, according to Schlein, was Renzi's \"completely unnecessary\" mistake. She said that personalizing and dramatizing the vote meant that many of the people who voted \"No\" -- particularly the younger voters -- did so for political reasons beyond the context of the reform and its consequences.\n\n\"The vote was transformed into a vote on himself and his government,\" she said.\n\n'A lost opportunity'\n\nIn Rome, emotions ranged from elation to extreme disappointment.\n\n\"I believe this was a lost opportunity for our country,\" Lino Settola, director of a private company, told CNN.\n\n\"What interested me was speeding up the process of passing laws and not continuing the ping pong between the House of Representatives and Senate, waiting years before things happen.\n\n\"This referendum would have helped speed this process up.\"\n\nGiuseppe Cazuolo, a photographer from Rome, was equally concerned by the result. \n\n\"What will happen is that the people who have governed Italy will return but nothing will happen,\" he said.\n\n\"It's too soon to say who will take power, but everything is in the hands of the President of the Republic now.\"\n\nHe added, \"I have faith in him, he is a person that Italians love because you can see he is a professional person.\" \n\nAnother voter, Alex, said that Renzi's mistake was making the referendum too political. \n\nHe also cited a frustration with Brussels and being governed by EU law as another area that caused political angst.\n\n\"I voted no, but I think people want a real change,\" Alex told CNN.\n\n\"They don't want just a political change, but a change where things really happen. I think the referendum was too political and Renzi made an error.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.6701461076736497, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 887, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.3787046261899998, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.12739571589628, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/16/health/cold-weather-health/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1182, "scraper_regex": 1290}}, "headline": "Stay warm! Your life may depend on it", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1290, "date": "20161216220000", "story_content": "Baby, it's cold outside -- and many of us first feel the freezing temperatures of winter in our toes and fingertips before elsewhere in the body.\n\nThis happens as your body works to protect your vital organs from the cold, said Dr. Suzanne Salamon, associate chief of clinical programs at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\n\"The blood vessels in all different parts of the body will constrict,\" she said. \"They'll get smaller to try to preserve heat.\n\n\"What the body tries really hard to do is to protect the most important organs, which are the ones deep inside: the heart and brain and lungs,\" she said. \"The body tries to keep those warm by redirecting heat from the fingers and toes inward, so the blood vessels in the fingers and toes get really small, and not enough blood goes through them.\"\n\nThis is important for the body to do -- and to do quickly -- because wintry weather has been associated with health risks for heart attacks, asthma symptoms, frostbite and hypothermia.\n\nGlobally, more temperature-attributable deaths tend to be caused by cold than by heat, according to a 2015 study published in the journal The Lancet.\n\nA cold-hearted risk\n\nFrosty weather can affect your heart, especially if you have cardiovascular disease. \"You always hear about people going out and shoveling snow and having a heart attack,\" Salamon said. \n\nCold weather can act as a vasoconstrictor, which means your blood vessels narrow, and that can play a role in raising the risk of heart attack, according to a 2014 Harvard Health Letter published by Harvard Medical School.\n\n\"Snow shoveling is one example where we see people who have heart disease, or risk factors for heart disease, exerting themselves more than they may otherwise. Shoveling is hard work; people who have cardiac disease and back problems are at higher risk for injury or illness while shoveling,\" said Dr. Reed Caldwell, an assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and an emergency department physician.\n\nA mere 1-degree Celsius reduction in temperature was associated with a cumulative 2% increased risk for heart attack, according to a 2010 study published in the British Medical Journal.\n\nThe study involved data on 84,010 hospital admissions for heart attacks in England and Wales between 2003 and 2006. The researchers analyzed the data to determine any possible relationship between outdoor temperature and heart attack occurrences.\n\nSome other studies have also found a correlation between the winter season and heart attacks and stroke, and the phenomenon has been sometimes referred to as \"Merry Christmas Coronary\" and \"Happy New Year Heart Attack.\"\n\nHowever, the heart isn't the only part of the body that might be vulnerable to health problems in the winter.\n\nCold weather can wreak havoc on your lungs, as dry air may irritate the airways, especially for people with lung diseases such as asthma, according to the American Lung Association.\n\n\"Cold air causes bronchospasm, so people with asthma and COPD can find themselves having increased symptoms in the winter months,\" Caldwell said.\n\nIf you have asthma and are exposed to cold weather, \"wear a scarf around your nose. That certainly helps, because then you're breathing in your own steam from your mouth,\" Salamon said.\n\nOn the other hand, a more well-known, cold-related health issue is frostbite. \n\nFrostbite: A danger even for the eyes\n\nFrostbite can occur in freezing temperatures when your blood vessels narrow, skin temperature drops and ice crystals form around and within your cells, causing damage.\n\n\"There's a continuum of cold-related skin injury. The first is called 'frostnip,' and that is a cooling of the outermost skin tissue without any actual destruction to the tissue. You know this is happening because the skin can become discolored, sometimes bright red, and can look irritated and feel extra sensitive, and that's a good warning sign that the skin is getting too cold,\" Caldwell said.\n\n\"Then, frostbite involves actual skin destruction, and frostbitten skin usually appears pale, waxy, and can sometimes turn even purple or black as the tissue begins to die. Frostbitten skin can be numb or painless,\" he said.\n\nFrostbite can even occur in your eyes, Salamon said. \"When you're out in the cold windy weather, you can actually get frostbite of your eyes, which is really dangerous,\" Salamon said.\n\n\"The cold starts to form little blisters in your eye or little crystals on your skin, which can turn around and damage the skin or the eye itself,\" she said. \"Those blood vessels really get very constricted, so there's not much blood going through it, which cuts down on the circulation of the eyes.\"\n\nThe blood vessels are constricting in order to prevent hypothermia, a dangerous condition that occurs when your body loses more heat than it produces, causing the body's core temperature to drop below 95 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\"The most worrisome health effect from cold exposure is hypothermia, which can cause damage to vital organs, including the heart, nervous system and kidneys. In extreme cases, death can occur. This often is a result of abnormal cardiac rhythms,\" said Dr. Jeahan Colletti,  an emergency medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nThose most at risk for hypothermia -- and any cold-related health hazard -- tend to be older adults, Salamon said.\n\n\"If people have a neighbor who is an older person, when there's weather that's really cold, they should check up on them. When people get really, really cold, they can get very confused and not even know enough to call for help,\" she said.\n\nTips to stay warm and healthy\n\nWhat can people do to stay warm and healthy this winter? An important risk-reducing measure hinges on wardrobe. \n\n\"It's really important to dress in layers, so ... put on more than one pair of gloves and then a mitten on top of that, because the air that's trapped in between those layers help to keep you warm,\" Salamon said.\n\n\"Tight-fitting clothes are not a good thing, because you're not able to get the benefit of the layers. You really need to have looser sweaters, shawls if you're sitting inside, to try to layer up. It helps to have a ski mask to protect your ears and your nose,\" she said. \"If you get wet, like if you're out playing in snow or shoveling snow, take off wet clothes, because the wet clothes really make it worse. They make things colder. ... Boots should be waterproof.\"\n\nPreventive measures not only involve dressing for the cold but also avoiding too many cocktails in cold weather, said Colletti, the Mayo Clinic specialist.\n\n\"Avoid drinking alcohol when in the cold, as mental awareness is impaired, thereby limiting ability to recognize symptoms of significant cold exposure. Alcohol also causes dilatation of the body's blood vessels, increasing heat loss,\" she said.\n\nCold weather is also associated with weight gain, so another tip to stay warm and healthy this winter is to keep moving, said Dr. Luis Navarro, a physician and founder of the Vein Treatment Center in New York.\n\n\"Weight gain is common during the colder holiday months, and this can put our legs and circulatory system under more stress. Weight gain and colder temperatures could make varicose veins and spider veins worsen, due to the fact that blood is not efficiently pumping through the body,\" Navarro said.\n\n\"Even though it's cold, exercising and moving around helps to optimize circulation, which not only helps to keep our circulatory system healthy, but it can also help to keep us warm,\" he said. \"Also, if you do experience leg pain as a result of restricted blood flow, I suggest elevating the legs for periods throughout the day so that they are raised above the heart. This helps maximize circulation.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.707668781280519, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1182, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 11, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.20123942939, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 5, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.36886632825719, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/arts/saving-rosa-parks-home-ryan-mendoza/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e7": [291]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1329, "scraper_regex": 1435}}, "headline": "An art project has saved Rosa Parks' family home from demolition ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1435, "date": "20161103110000", "story_content": "Rhea McCauley was tired. She had been trying to save her aunt's crumbling Detroit house for more than a decade, to no avail. \n\nThe black and white clapboard house was beyond repair -- the roof had collapsed and although the fa\u00e7ade was still standing, the entire back wall had fallen away, exposing the living room, kitchen and bedrooms to the open air. \n\nIt was slated to be demolished, just one of 80 thousand derelict homes blighting Detroit.\n\n\"I watched the abuse of the property,\" she tells CNN over the phone. \"There was drug use, pilfering of the home. The furnace and wiring pulled out. Then the property flooded and mold set in.\"\n\nBut this was no ordinary home, she argued, the building had historic value -- It was the home of her aunt, the world-famous American civil rights leader Rosa Parks. \n\nPersecuting an activist\n\nThe woman who refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955. It was a simple act that sparked a historic boycott and launched a nationwide civil rights movement.  \n\nFor many, this is the Rosa Parks they know, her black and white mug shot staring at the police that arrested her, quiet but defiant. \n\nBut not many know what happened after. She faced daily threats of violence. She lost her job as a seamstress after economic sanctions were imposed against civil rights activists. Her husband quit his work when he was barred from mentioning his wife or her activism.   \n\nShe decided to pick up and join her brother in a city where so many other black families were hoping to make a better life -- Detroit.  \n\n\"My dad had been begging over the years for Auntie Rosa to please move up here,\" McCauley explains. \"Now, maybe you think that when Auntie Rosa came up here she had cash, like a big roll of cash. No. Penniless. She was completely penniless.\" \n\nHer brother's home in Detroit was modest. A small, two-story home and Parks -- who had no children of her own but plenty of nieces and nephews -- became just one member of a family of 13 kids living in a three-bedroom house.  \n\nAn unlikely hero\n\nFor Parks' remaining family, it's important for the world to know the hardship she faced after her her historic protest and how she overcame it and committed herself to activism in Detroit.\n\n\"As a kid, I never thought we were really poor,\" McCauley recalls of her childhood in the house. \"But we were on welfare. And I remember once my mother had one can of milk to feed 13 kids with!\"\n\nBut as the family members grew up, the house was left behind, moving from owner to owner. When Rhea McCauley went back to her childhood home, she found it was set to be demolished. \n\nFirst, she paid $500 to pull the house off the demolition list. Then, she went to dozens of people hoping to find an investor that would rehabilitate the house into a memorial or a museum. But she was told it would be impossible: Nobody wanted to sink as much as $20 thousand into restoring the badly damaged home.  \n\n\"There was nothing I could do to protect the property. I talked to neighbors. I asked for help. You could use the word 'beg',\" she says. \"I begged several organizations that Auntie Rosa worked with because I thought they loved her. But no, they didn't want to help me restore the property.\"\n\nSo, if the house could not be restored how could it be saved?\n\nThe answer came in an unlikely form -- Ryan Mendoza, an American artist living in Berlin, was looking for houses that resembled his childhood home in Pennsylvania as a way to reconnect with his home country. Detroit, a city with more than 80 thousand derelict homes set for demolition, was an ideal place to look. \n\n\"All of my work deals with things and people who have been forgotten on some level.\" Mendoza explains to CNN. \"Detroit is one of the most vulnerable cities in the U.S. right now and real estate prices are so low that when we had this idea -- Let's bring this house from the United States, cut it up in pieces and ship to Europe. Detroit was a place we could do that.\"\n\nDismantling history\n\nHe had already bought one derelict home in Detroit and turned it onto an installation he called \"The White House\" now on permanent display at the Verbeke Foundation in Belgium.  \n\nIt was a local Detroit TV personality, Greg Dunmore, and his producer/photographer, Joel Boykin, who put Mendoza and McCauley together.  \n\n\"I said: Rhea, there is this artist who I think is absolutely brilliant,\" Dunmore explains over the phone to CNN. \"You have got to meet him. He takes a home and turns into an art piece. Would you be interested in meeting him?\"\n\nThey took Mendoza for a cruise past the crumbling home, and the look on Mendoza's face upon seeing the home convinced Rhea it was the right move. \n\n\"I could see he was an American who really cared. And he loved Auntie Rosa. But he also really cares about Detroit, and that's important,\" she says.\n\nIt took 18 days to dismantle Parks' house. They began with the roof and worked their way down to the wooden floorboards. After chipping away decades of built-up linoleum and paint, Mendoza smoothed out the original floorboards and imagined how they might be lit in an installation.\n\n\"Things become important when they are symbolic,\" he tells CNN. \"So, of course the floor that she walked on. You have to ask yourself -- Is this something that is worthless or is it priceless?  And right now in America, this house and the floor she walked, seems worthless.\"\n\nAt first, neighbors viewed Mendoza with suspicion and threatened to derail the project. But as he continued to work, a diverse group of volunteers began to help out. \n\nLocal \"camera activist\" and neighbor, Jonathan Pommerville brought a generator and pitched in with a crowbar to lift up the floor planks. Neighbors Titus and Orlando helped to load the heavy door frames.  And a kindly neighbor across the street, Miss Ann, brought the workers lunch every day.  \n\nMendoza's wife Fabia filmed the entire dismantling of the house for a film called \"The White House Documentary.\" \n\nShe captured some extraordinary moments as volunteers and neighbors come to pay their respects to the home of Rosa Parks. \n\nThey sing spontaneously to the camera and recite poetry. To watch the video is to witness a eulogy from a community trying to save a forgotten piece of American history, even if it means shipping it out of the country.   \n\nAfter more than two weeks of work, volunteers, neighbors and supporters gathered to say goodbye, including the colorful members of Detroit's East Side Riders bicycle club. \n\nThe remaining carcass of the house was draped with a tarp with the words \"Out of Love\" painted across it. McCauley made an impassioned speech in front of the home she had once lived in, just before the bulldozers came to knock it down. \n\nFrom Detroit to Berlin\n\nMore than four thousand miles from Detroit, in a former Berlin distillery and now arts space, Mendoza speaks about his plans for the house. \n\nHe now has a shipping container filled with roof tiles, windows, and doors next to his Berlin studio. He's begun by pouring the concrete foundations but is reluctant to let anyone see the work in progress and talks to CNN in front of the tarp that once draped the house. \n\n\"This is not where the house is going to be rebuilt,\" he explains. \"I wanted to keep that a bit of a secret.\" \n\nSlowly, he says, he will put this piece of American history back together even though he's still not sure how the art installation will take shape or which art space will exhibit the piece. He dreams big:  An installation on the lawn of The White House. \n\n\"I would love for Michelle Obama see this and say: a piece of American history has got to come back home,\" He imagines out loud. \"I can see it from above. I can see the White House there and this tiny, insignificant black house staring the White House down.\"\n\nWhile waiting for the final project, McCauley has already started work on a Rosa Parks community garden. \n\nWhere the house once stood, she has planted fruit trees and vegetable patches and pans to donate their produce to the local food bank, preserving Parks' legacy and keeping cherished childhood memories of Auntie Rosa alive.

The text of the order doesn't name the countries, but a White House official said they are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.\n\nFull text of Trump's executive order\n\nThe same order also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated for nationals of countries that Trump's Cabinet believes can be properly vetted.\n\nThe total number of refugees admitted into the United States will be capped during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump vowed to ban Muslim immigrants from countries with a \"proven history\" of terrorism against the United States or its allies.\n\nFriday's executive order gives the Department of Homeland Security leeway to prioritize refugee claims \"on the basis of religious based persecution\" as long as the person applying for refugee status is \"a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\"\n\nThat would make it easier for Christians and other religious minorities in majority-Muslim countries to enter the United States than it would for Muslims in general.\n\nTrump's order also cancels the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which once allowed repeat travelers to the United States to be able to forgo an in-person interview to renew their visa. Under the new order, these travelers must now have an in-person interview.\n\n\"We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,\" the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. refugee agency said in a joint statement.\n\nWhat's the reaction to his plan?\n\nAbed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said Trump's actions were \"tantamount to a Muslim ban.\" \n\n\"In our view, these actions taken by Trump and this administration have nothing to do with national security,\" he said. \"They're based off Islamophobia, they're based off of xenophobia, and we cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nJustin Cox, a staff attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, agreed. \n\n\"This is a Muslim ban,\" Cox said. \"It doesn't say that in those words, but those seven countries are Muslim-majority.\"\n\nThe National Iranian American Council, for instance, pointed out that all seven nations have Muslim-majority populations. \n\n\"We agree with the goal of making America safe from terror, but a blanket ban based on national origin does nothing to achieve that objective,\" the council's statement said.\n\nHow many people come to the US from countries Trump is targeting? \n\nIn the last fiscal year, 43% of refugees admitted into the United States came from the seven countries that could be affected by restrictions, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center. \n\nThe Obama administration had pushed to resettle at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the United States as part of humanitarian efforts in 2016.\n\nDuring fiscal 2016, which began October 2015 and ended September 2016, the United States admitted the following number of refugees from the seven countries: 9,880 from Iraq; 3,750 from Iran; 1 from Libya; 9,020 from Somalia; 12,587 from Syria; 1,458 from Sudan and 26 from Yemen. \n\nAre other types of visas available? \n\nApart from refugees, there are also other types of visas issued by the United States. Here are the number of total US non-immigrant and immigrant visas issued to the affected countries in 2015: 15,509 to Iraq; 42,542 to Iran; 3,575 to Libya; 1,409 to Somalia; 11,962 to Syria; 2,153 to Sudan and 7,668 to Yemen.\n\nWhat do critics of the resettlement effort say? \n\nThe issue is a major domestic political flashpoint. Critics like Trump and several Republican governors have expressed concern about the potential for ISIS or other terrorist groups to exploit refugee flows to reach the West.\n\nMigrant crisis: 2016 is the deadliest year for Mediterranean\n\nIs it legal?\n\nHours after Trump signed the executive orders, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) announced it will mount a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the order.\n\nCAIR said more than 20 plaintiffs have joined the suit, the details of which will be announced Monday.\n\n\"The courts must do what President Trump will not -- ensure that our government refrains from segregating people based on their faith,\" said Gadeir Abbas, co-counsel on CAIR's lawsuit.\n\nStill, the Immigration and Nationality Act grants broad-ranging powers to the President: \n\n\"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,\" part of the act reads.\n\nThis suggests Trump has a lot of leeway.\n\nBut another section of the law, which was passed in 1965 during the Civil Rights movement, states that \"no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.\"\n\nIn an analysis piece, David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, wrote that such protection extends to green card holders and may not extend to non-immigrants such as refugees, asylum seekers, guest workers, tourists and temporary visitors.\n\nWhat will be some effects of these actions? \n\nMelanie Nezer, vice president for policy and advocacy at HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit, said Trump's actions could be devastating for refugees. \"People will literally, if this goes through, not be allowed to get on planes, or arrive in the US and be told they have to go back,\" she said. \n\nShe said she wonders whether refugees who have already been approved for travel to the United States will have their papers revoked.\n\n\"So maybe they've given up their housing,\" Nezer said. \"Maybe they're waiting at the airport and everything has been sold.\"\n\nSaid Cox, \"It could have real consequences for individuals who have been issued visas and are making their way to the United States right now. They could conceivably be denied entry at airports or at the border.\" \n\nIs there precedent for this? \n\nPresident George W. Bush suspended refugee admissions for three months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks while certain safeguard were put in place.\n\nHowever, banning people from specific countries is new.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any prior such edict from the president saying that people from a particular country aren't permitted to be admitted as refugees,\" Cox said.

President-elect Donald Trump's plan to elevate ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to a position as secretary of state, America's chief diplomat, would formally validate the suspicion that a corporate takeover of our national interest is underway.\n\nUnder Tillerson's direction, Exxon has been an influential kingmaker in geopolitics, often pursuing an agenda, from Russia to Iraq, that, according to reporting by Steve Coll and others, has prioritized shareholders but directly conflicted with the best interests of America. \n\nThe volume of Tillerson's personal and financial conflicts of interest from his 40 years at Exxon should themselves serve as a disqualification: How can the ExxonMobil boss separate his array of deals with dictators, strongmen and guerrilla insurgents from his State Department duties? \n\nIndeed, proponents of the Tillerson pick can only reference a single employer from his resume: his 40+ year ExxonMobil career.  \n\nEven if Tillerson can somehow divest his 2.5 million ExxonMobil shares and blind trust his expected golden parachute and pension, he cannot dissociate himself from Exxon's interests: working at the company is all he has known. \n\nThe nature of multinational \"extractive\" industries, like oil and gas, often entails controversial financial relationships with often-undemocratic and nontransparent regimes, many of which, such as Russia, pursue agendas directly at odds with those of the United States, making the industry unique. \n\nCongress recognized the inherent corruptive relationship between oil corporations and foreign governments when it required oil and gas companies to disclose such payments as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.  \n\nExxon's trade association, the American Petroleum Institute, opposed that transparency rule, arguing it unfairly held US oil companies to a higher standard than state-owned oil companies.  You might have thought that part of America's greatness comes from leading by example: The United States sets the moral bar for the rest of the world to follow. But Exxon and its trade association disagree: When it comes to transparency, they prefer a race to the bottom.\n\nTillerson has openly challenged established US foreign policy in order to prioritize his company's financial interests. He publicly questioned the effectiveness of America imposing sanctions against our enemies, because it would harm his business investments. This, despite generations of bipartisan support for using sanctions as a backbone policy with which to confront and corner America's enemies. \n\nColl, the author of \"Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power,\" described how Tillerson defied the US government by negotiating an oil deal with the Kurdish Regional Government that undermined existing oil agreements with Iraq's central government in Baghdad, sparking an international furor between the United States and Iraq. \n\nIn short, Tillerson has used Exxon and its nearly $400 billion market capitalization as his own global fiefdom.\n\nWe may like to imagine that big American corporations work in benevolent common cause with citizens (it was once an American axiom: \"What's good for General Motors is good for America\"), but it is clear that what is good for Exxon is not necessarily good for America. \n\nWhile some 97% of America's climate scientists understand that evidence unequivocally shows Earth's temperatures rising due to the burning of oil, natural gas and other fossil fuels, under Tillerson's leadership, ExxonMobil funded a national campaign to intentionally sow confusion where none should exist by baselessly attacking the science.  Tillerson may now say his company backs \"serious action\" to combat climate change, but his actions tell a different story. \n\nBut one doesn't need to think globally to get a feel for Exxon's impact in a community. Residents of Mayflower, Arkansas, were shocked when, in 2013, more than 200,000 gallons of heavy crude oil saturated their small town. That's because most residents, including some city officials,  had no idea Exxon operated the Pegasus pipeline right under their city.  \n\nExxon was forced to pay a $2.6 million fine for numerous safety violations. The Arkansas disaster came just two years after another Exxon pipeline burst under the Yellowstone River in Montana, where the company paid a $1.6 million fine and agreed to a separate $12 million settlement.  It seems Exxon just doesn't learn its lessons. \n\nBut the American people can.  \n\nTillerson's ExxonMobil track record is at odds with what's best for the country. We can and must do better for our top diplomatic post.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.03821659088135, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 701, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.67526163083, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213230000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.99429386590585, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/22/europe/anis-amri-berlin-christmas-market/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 503, "scraper_regex": 1040}}, "headline": "Berlin Christmas market attack suspect: Who was Anis Amri?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1040, "date": "20161222080000", "story_content": "Anis Amri, the Tunisian suspect identified in this week's deadly attack on a Berlin Christmas market, died Friday in a shootout in Milan, according to Italian police. \n\nThe suspect was killed just after 3 a.m. local time, the Italian state police said on its Twitter feed.\n\nWhen the man was asked for his papers by police, he pulled a .22-caliber gun out of his backpack and fired, according to the tweet. The driver of the police car returned fire, killing the suspect. A police officer was injured in the shootout, according to Italian police.\n\nAmri, 24, had become a wanted man after Monday's attack in Berlin that killed 12 people and injured 48. Though others could have been involved, Amri was the only suspect who had been publicly identified.\n\nHe had been considered violent and believed to be armed.\n\nAnd according to German investigative files that CNN saw Thursday, Amri had previously discussed launching an attack in Germany.\n\nHere's what we know about him. \n\nItaly\n\nAmri was one of four children, according to a man who claimed to be his father. \n\nThe man said in an interview on Tunisian radio that Amri left for Italy about seven years ago after dropping out of school.\n\nWhile in Italy, he served four years in prison after he was involved in an arson attack on a school, his father said. Amri left for Germany more than a year ago, he added.\n\nThe elder Amri said he had not been in touch with his son, though the younger Amri maintained sporadic contact with his siblings.    \n\nA spokesman for the Italian state police, Mario Viola, told CNN that Amri's jail term for damaging state property, assault and arson at the Lampedusa refugee center began in late 2011. He was released in May 2015.\n\nAmri entered Italy in February 2011 without any ID and claimed to be a 17-year-old minor, according to the spokesman. Italian authorities ordered his deportation, but Tunisian authorities wouldn't accept the request on the grounds of a lack of proper documentation, Viola said. \n\nAt that point, Italian authorities told Amri to leave the country, and officials lost track of him, according to Viola. Amri was \"not suspected\" of terrorism at the time and was considered a \"petty criminal,\" Viola said. The Tunisian came to Italy at the same time as thousands of others amid the turmoil of the Arab Spring, he said. \n\nGermany \n\nAmri was believed to have gone to Germany in July 2015 and had traveled between Berlin and other cities -- but was mostly in Berlin since February, said Ralf Jaeger, interior minister of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nAmri requested asylum in Germany but was denied, according to Jaeger. \n\nDeportation proceedings were started but were not completed because Amri's identity could not be definitively established, according Stephan Mayer, a spokesman for the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union parliamentary group.\n\nWhile in Germany, authorities had their eye on Amri -- he was believed to be in touch with radical Islamists, including a recruitment network for ISIS operating in Germany, German security officials told CNN.\n\nWhen ISIS lives next door: Tunisia's desperate fight against extremism\n\nThe main figure in the network, Ahmad Abdulaziz Abdullah -- a 32-year-old Iraqi national also known as Abu Walaa -- and four others were arrested and charged with terrorism offenses in November.\n\nJaeger said he could not confirm a link to Abu Walaa.\n\nBut according to the investigative files that CNN saw, German authorities were aware that Amri had close ties to the Abu Walaa network.\n\nAmri was particularly close to one of those charged in November, Boban Simeonovic, a German intelligence official told CNN.\n\nAmri was mentioned several times by name in the 345-page investigative file, which underpinned the case built by prosecutors.\n\n\"Anis spoke several times about committing attacks,\" a police informant told German investigators, according to the files. The informant said Simeonovic and another member of the network \"were in favor of that and gave him a place to hide.\"   \n\nMembers of the Abu Walaa network also discussed driving a truck full of gasoline with a bomb into a crowd, the police informant told investigators, according to the documents.\n\nIn late 2015 and early 2016, Simeonovic tried through his contacts at a mosque in the northern German town of Hildesheim to arrange logistics for Amri to leave the country, according to the files. \n\nAccording to the police informant, Simeonovic repeatedly stressed to followers in Germany that there was a \"state of war\" in the country. Simeonovic and Abu Walaa \"deem attacks justified, desire attacks, and support attackers,\" the informant stated. \n\n\"The only topic when I moved in these circles ... was how to join the armed jihad or how to get it to Germany ... by which I mean armed jihad for the Islamic State,\" the police informant said. \n\nAmri -- who was thought to have used six aliases, according to authorities -- also showed up on the radar of German police because he was looking for a gun, one German security official said.\n\nIn August, he was arrested with forged documents in the southern German town of Friedrichshafen en route to Italy, the security official said. \n\nBut a judge later ordered his release. \n\nThe hunt\n\nInside the truck that plowed through the Christmas market, authorities found a Polish man shot dead and a set of identity papers belonging to Amri.\n\nThe slain driver may have been involved in a struggle with the suspect inside the truck's cabin before being shot, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. The papers could have been dropped during some sort of altercation. \n\nAuthorities publicly identified Amri on Wednesday, released pictures of him and offered a reward of up to 100,000 euros (about $104,000) for information on his whereabouts.\n\nGermany's federal prosecutor said raids had taken place Thursday in cities across Germany. One was in Emmerich, in North Rhine-Westphalia, at a refugee shelter where Amri reportedly stayed before moving to Berlin.\n\nPolice also carried out a number of raids in the region on Wednesday, a German security official told CNN. \n\nISIS claimed it inspired the attack. The terror group's affiliated Amaq News Agency described the perpetrator as a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" who had acted in response to calls for attacks in the West.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.20446109771729, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 503, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.3914448069, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.1749502982107405, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/opinions/voting-for-the-first-time-pupino/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Why I'm voting for the first time", "wordcount_as_scraped": 724, "date": "20161107190000", "story_content": "I'm currently at college in Washington, D.C., so I voted with an absentee ballot in my home county in Ohio. \n\nI'm 20 years old, so this isn't the first election I could have voted in. But my excuses for not voting since I became eligible at 18 were numerous. Going to the DMV to register was too much of a hassle. I decided that I didn't care about local elections and down-ballot races. It was too difficult to register while I was away at school. Neither of my parents had voted since before I was born, so it couldn't be that important. \n\nI've also heard countless excuses from those not voting in this year's elections. There's the familiar reasoning about not having time to register, or the registration process being too difficult (there is some truth to this, especially in marginalized communities). \n\nBut there are also a new set of excuses from non-voters, especially those around my age. They don't like the major candidates. Their candidate is not on the ballot. Their vote won't matter because of where they live. No candidates prioritize the issues they care about. \n\nAs a millennial who sat out two elections, I understand just how easy it is to stay on the sidelines. I understand doubting the ability of any politician to effect meaningful change, or make any change at all, in one term. I understand nationwide disillusionment with major party nominees. \n\nBut what I can no longer understand is skipping out on the process entirely, especially with down-ballot races in play. \n\nWhat changed my mind about voting? It's more than just electing a president. I also need members of Congress who won't cut the Pell Grant funding that helps me pay for college. I need state representatives who will decide everything from whether police must wear body cameras to abortion access to funding for public health services. \n\nI need state school board members who will make decisions that have very real consequences for my little sister and brother, who are still students in Ohio's public schools. I need state and local judges and county sheriffs who will determine if justice is dispensed, or not dispensed, in my community. \n\nWhen I turned in my absentee ballot a few weeks ago, I voted on candidates for all of these positions. \n\nI've talked to many of my peers who say that they feel powerless this election season. At times, I've felt that way too. After video emerged of Donald Trump describing sexually assaulting women, and other women came forward to recount their personal experiences with the Republican presidential nominee, I watched helplessly as conversations all around me turned to the topic of sexual assault. \n\nEvery news broadcast I saw, every minute spent browsing Facebook risked turning traumatic, with pundits and my relatives alike arguing about whether or not grabbing someone by the genitals was assault. As an assault survivor myself, I watched in horror during a debate as Trump himself urged questioners to get to \"much more important\" issues than sexual assault and the safety of victims.\n\nI felt helpless. But this feeling of helplessness is exactly what makes voting so important. \n\nWhen I vote, I am looking at my values and deciding which candidates and issues best uphold those values. Voting gives me the chance to have my own personal referendum on the politicians and policies already in place. \n\nIn an election cycle where coverage of sexual violence has enraged and saddened me, voting gives me the opportunity to select leaders who will work towards a world that is safer for people like me. In an election cycle where the needs of those living in poverty have not been a topic of much discussion, I can vote for leaders whose decisions will affect Medicaid, SNAP and other welfare programs in my state and across the nation. \n\nIn an election cycle where so much of the rhetoric has been about people that I care deeply about -- including my friends and colleagues who are people of color, Muslims and immigrants -- voting allows me to select leaders who will work to right past and present wrongs, ensure that their safety and rights are upheld, and create a more equitable America. \n\n All across the nation this fall, millions of my fellow Americans are also putting their values into action. That's not helplessness. That's power.

On Thursday, the Garden State became the first in the US to launch a universal baby box program in an attempt to reduce infant mortality rates.\n\nThe baby box program follows the example of Finland, which has had a similar program in place since the 1930s. Any expecting parent or parents of infants younger than 3 months old in New Jersey can take a short online educational program and receive a box filled with newborn essentials that can also serve as a safe sleeping space. \n\nThe Baby Box Co., a California-based company, paired up with New Jersey's Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board on a grant from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention in order to reduce Sudden Unexpected Infant Death and improve family health care. \n\nAccording to the company, the program will continue beyond 2017 based on its success, measured by parents' use of the boxes and improvements tracked in the state's health outcomes. \n\nThe cardboard boxes, distributed at Cooper University Healthcare and Southern New Jersey Perinatal Cooperative, come with a firm mattress, a waterproof cover and a fitted sheet, in addition to diapers, wipes, breast cream, breast pads, a onesie and an activity cart: about $150 in materials. \n\nJernica Quionnes, 33, a new mother from Camden, New Jersey, came to the program's launch Thursday to receive a baby box. She has a 2-month-old, Bless'n. \n\n\"I have it in the living room right now,\" she said, noting that it's lightweight and easy to move around. \"I never thought about having one, but it lets me put the baby down while I'm in the kitchen.\"\n\nBaby Box Co. CEO and co-founder Jennifer Clary said the company will distribute about 105,000 free boxes in New Jersey -- the anticipated number of births in 2017 -- ensuring that every expecting family in the state can get one. \n\nTo receive a box, parents must register for free at babyboxuniversity.com as New Jersey residents and include valid contact information and mailing address. They will watch a program lasting 10 to 15 minutes and take a short quiz to get a certificate of completion. Then, they can choose to collect their box from the closest distribution partner or have it shipped to their address. \n\nThe Baby Box Co. launched its first city-wide initiative in San Francisco in November. The boxes are also available to people who live outside New Jersey or San Francisco for $70 to $225.\n\nBaby Box Co. initially started as a \"baby shower in a box\" product meant for gifting to friends and family, Clary said. But after visiting Finland to learn about its health care system, the company pivoted to integrate an educational platform. In Finland, \"maternity boxes\" are an institution, of sorts, parents there said.\n\nSatu Korkohen of Helsinki, mother of 2-week-old Emma, explained that the box she received introduced her to parenthood and gave her an idea of the optimal sleeping conditions for her baby.\n\n\"The products inside as well as the box itself are clues to good parenting,\" she said. \"Once you see the tiny baby nail scissors, you start wondering how often will you need to use them, or the bath thermometer. So even if you could afford to purchase all the stuff, it's emotionally very comforting to have the essentials ready at hand and delivered to you.\"\n\nOrganizers say the online program for New Jersey parents will help them make safe, healthy choices and decrease babies' risk of death due to an unsafe sleep environment or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, one aspect of Sudden Unexplained Infant Death. \n\nThere are an estimated 3,500 deaths from SIDS and other sleep-related deaths in the United States each year, according to the CDC. Forty-four percent of these are caused by sudden infant death, with 25% accidental strangulation or suffocation in bed and the rest unknown.\n\nUS Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for a safe sleeping environment for babies say parents should use a sleep surface such as a firm mattress or safety-approved crib covered by a fitted sheet, and nothing should be covering a baby's head. Additionally, blankets, crib bumpers and pillows should be kept out of the sleep area. Loose bedding and soft toys should also be left out, and smoking should be forbidden near the baby. \n\nBabies should always be put on their back to go to sleep and be dressed in a one-piece sleeper, without a blanket, according to the guidelines.

Now 88, Rosenberg lives in Long Island, New York.\n\nOf the 50,000 survivors residing in the New York Metropolitan area, 52% are considered \"poor,\" living below 150% of federal poverty guidelines, or an individual annual income of less than $18,000, according to Selfhelp, an organization that has assisted victims of Nazi crimes since 1936. \n\n\"It's a shocking statistic,\" said Hanan Simhon, vice president of Holocaust Survivor Services at Selfhelp. \n\nSurvivors from the former Soviet Union have it particularly bad, he said, with 80% of them living in poverty. \"They came here much later in their life at the fall of the Soviet Union, with no Social Security, pension or any type of supporting income for retirement.\"\n\nAs they age, this last generation of survivors incurs increasingly complex financial needs. \n\nThe poverty is due to a number of factors, said Masha Pearl, executive director of The Blue Card. \n\n\"They tend to be very isolated, losing their families during the war and then either did not or could not have children,\" said Pearl. \"Many started working in menial jobs because they did not have the language skills. Today they are in their 80s and 90s and it is beyond difficult to make ends meet.\"\n\nMedical experiments performed on Jews held in Nazi concentration camps have also put survivors at higher risk for costly diseases, such as cancer.\n\nSami Steigmann spent his early childhood years in a Nazi labor camp. Years later, he was told by his father that he was subjected to medical experiments, which still cause him pain today at 77. \"I'm a proud person, I never wanted to reach out for help,\" he said. \n\nBut after years of struggle and \"getting involved with the wrong people,\" he found himself homeless. \"I'm not a street person, I wanted to commit suicide,\" he said. It was only then when he agreed to be recognized as a survivor and mentally disabled, receive reparations from Germany and move into subsidized housing.\n\n\"Many are embarrassed to be in this situation, feeling as if they've failed twice -- not being able to save their family and now having to turn for help,\" said Pearl. \"People with food stamps in the grocery store are trembling and afraid that someone will see them. Many of them wait to come forward because they are too ashamed.\"\n\nWhen he couldn't afford a hearing aid, Steigmann once again reached out for assistance from Jewish organizations.\n\nToday, Steigmann lives in a tiny studio apartment in New York. The building was recently bought and he will soon need to vacate the place he's called home for the last 20 years. Steigmann, who volunteers as a tutor teaching students about the Holocaust, fears he will no longer be able to participate in such activities, which he believes have been lifesaving.\n\nThe Blue Card, which serves 2,500 Holocaust survivors nationwide, experienced a 20% increase in requests for assistance in 2016. Their latest survey found the greatest needs for financial assistance were for home care, food and utilities. Of those they service, 67% cannot leave their homes without assistance and 78% have difficulty performing daily activities such as dressing, washing and cooking, according to the survey.\n\nThe majority of The Blue Card's dependents -- 77% -- are women. \n\nRosenberg, who is well past retirement age, said she still works to help herself, both mentally and economically. \"It helps me cope, but I also need to work to supplement my income,\" she said.\n\nShe has been the sole provider for her household since her husband left 25 years ago, and today depends on the financial aid and dental services she receives from The Blue Card. \n\nRosenberg lost an arm in a German munitions factory, but otherwise is in relatively good shape, and said she is fortunate to be living independently. She is concerned, however, she won't be able to afford home care when the time comes, and that a proper nursing home for survivors does not exist.\n\nSimhon of Selfhelp said they have 1,400 residents in 10 affordable housing sites throughout the New York area and a waiting list of 4,000. Some 250 survivors are on a waiting list in Brooklyn for a social worker to be assigned to them and three to four new clients register each day.\n\n\"These are limited resources for a limited time -- there won't be new Holocaust survivors taking their place,\" Simhon said. \"The cost to provide services is going up and the needs are more intense than ever.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.88457274436951, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 829, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.35312347374, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.53317249698432, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/opinions/trump-abandoning-americas-principles-aslan/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "If Trump can threaten my rights, he can do the same for any of us", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1208, "date": "20170126170000", "story_content": "When I was 7, my family fled a violent revolution in Iran that had transformed our country from an oppressive secular dictatorship to an even more oppressive religious one. We arrived in the United States with nothing but a single suitcase each. We had no money, no jobs and no place to live but a cramped, one-room motel we could barely afford. \n\nThis was during the Iranian hostage crisis -- 444 days in which Americans were held captive in the US Embassy in Tehran. People would routinely shout at us on the street, call us terrorists, tell us to \"go back home.\"\n\nIt didn't matter that we had no home; we had abandoned everything and everyone we knew for an uncertain life in a foreign land precisely because we were fleeing the same repressive regime that our neighbors were so frightened of. What mattered was that we looked different. We seemed different. And so we became the enemy. \n\nAnd yet we knew that no matter what happened, we had the law on our side. That was, after all, the entire reason we had come to the United States. While many of our friends and family members in Iran fled to France, Germany and the United Kingdom, we chose America because we knew what America meant. We knew what it stood for. We were certain we could weather any attack on our faith or ethnicity because the US Constitution -- which we had heard so much about in Iran -- would be our shield against the fears and prejudice of our neighbors. \n\nToday, the man whose job it is to enforce that Constitution is taking yet another step toward abandoning the principles upon which it was written. Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order that will effectively bar citizens of a number of Muslim countries -- including Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Syria -- from entering the United States. The reported plan would be a first step in Trump's repeated promise of a ban on all Muslim immigrants. \n\nTrump will argue that he has the law on his side, citing the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 212(f), as precedent for his executive action. The act allows the president to deny entry into the United States by any alien deemed detrimental to the interests of the country. It was passed in response to the anti-communist hysteria that gripped the country in the 1950s -- an absurd reaction to a nonexistent threat that every schoolchild in America is now taught was irrational, unfounded and in violation of all the norms and values upon which this country was founded. (Sound familiar?) \n\nIt was for this reason that President Harry Truman originally vetoed the bill, specifically arguing the law would repudiate \"our basic religious concepts, our belief in the brotherhood of man, and, in the words of St. Paul, that 'there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free... for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.' \" \n\nCongress ultimately overrode Truman's veto. Still, no president has ever attempted to use the act to implement a religious test on migration for the simple reason that a ban based on religion violates the establishment clause of Constitution. But that is exactly what Trump is planning on doing. \n\nMake no mistake: Trump's executive order is nothing more than a Muslim ban by another name. Trump claims such a ban is based on nationality, not religion -- that it is simply coincidence the ban applies only to Muslim-majority countries. That is yet another lie from a man who has proven himself to be a serial liar.  \n\nConsider that while the ban would make exceptions for \"religious minorities\" fleeing religious persecution in their home countries, it expressly denies entry to Muslim refugees fleeing religious persecution from Muslim governments. In other words, a Druze fearing oppression in Syria would be allowed in the United States under Trump's proposed ban, but a Sunni facing slaughter would not. A Christian fleeing discrimination in Yemen would be given entry, but a Shia facing death and starvation would not. A Baha'i seeking refuge from Iran would be welcomed in America, but a moderate Muslim family such as mine fleeing Islamic fundamentalism would not. \n\nTrump has also argued that the restrictions would focus on countries whose migrants could pose a threat to Americans. But this, too, is a lie. If this act were meant to safeguard the homeland from citizens from terror-prone countries, then it would include (which it reportedly doesn't) a ban on citizens from Saudi Arabia -- a country whose citizens have killed more American civilians than every other banned country on Trump's list combined. Indeed, of the 19 terrorists who attacked us on 9/11, 15 were from Saudi Arabia, two were from the United Arab Emirates, one was from Egypt and one from Lebanon. Not a single one of these countries are on Trump's banned list, though, with the possible exception of Lebanon, Trump has business ties in all of them. \n\nAll of this proves that this executive order is nothing more than a cynical cover for what Trump has repeatedly promised would be a complete ban on Muslims entering the United States (Muslims he doesn't make a profit from, that is), and the full-frontal assault on the civil rights of Muslim citizens in the United States. That is not fear-mongering; it is not an exaggeration. It is explicitly what Trump vowed to do as president when he discussed creating a database for all Muslims in the United States; when he threatened to send American citizens to the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; when he assembled the most rabidly anti-Muslim Cabinet in recent memory, including a national security adviser who believes \"Islam is not a real religion, but a political ideology masked behind a religion\"; when he reportedly gets his views and policies about Muslims from officially designated hate groups.\n\nIt took 16 years of living in this country before I finally qualified for citizenship at the age of 23. As an adult taking a solemn oath, I was perfectly conscious of the decision I was making. I fully understood the promise I made to America to renounce any loyalty I may have to the country of my birth, and to defend my adopted country from all enemies foreign and domestic.\n\nI also fully understood the promise my country was making to me: that I, like so many millions who have made America their home, would have the same opportunity as everyone else to seek, not just a better life, but a life worth living; that my parents dream of giving me the opportunity to flourish would not be trampled upon by bigotry and fear, but would be protected by the law.  \n\nMy family made the most of that promise. It wasn't easy, but my father got an advanced degree and started his own business. My mother took odd jobs and scrimped and saved. I was sent to a private university where I thrived. I now have an American family of my own. \n\nI am not just an example of the American success story. I am America. And if the President of the United States can threaten my rights as a citizen, then he can do the same for any one of us.

The orders also call for stripping sanctuary cities of federal grant funding and announced sweeping new criteria that could make many more undocumented immigrants priorities for deportation.\n\n\"Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders,\" Trump told employees of the Department of Homeland Security at the department's headquarters in Washington.\n\nBut while Trump directed the \"immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border,\" the executive orders do not cover the cost of the wall. Trump has repeatedly promised that Mexico will reimburse US taxpayers for the construction costs, a suggestion Mexican officials have rejected out of hand.\n\nThe president's moves sent alarm bells ringing in immigrant activist circles, where questions had continued to swirl about whether Trump would truly implement many of the hard-line immigration policies he articulated during his campaign. \n\nTrump also indicated he does not need Congress to pass new legislation to implement the border control and immigration reform agenda he outlined during his campaign for president, saying he would \"work within the existing system and framework.\"\n\n\"We do not need new laws,\" Trump said soon after signing the two executive orders.\n\nThe executive orders Trump signed Wednesday call for boosting the ranks of Border Patrol forces by an additional 5,000 agents as well as for 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to carry out deportations. The orders noted that the increases were subject to Congress's appropriation of sufficient funds.\n\nBuilding the wall\n\nConstruction of the wall could begin in months, but planning for the massive project is \"starting immediately,\" Trump said Wednesday in an interview with ABC News.\n\nTrump confirmed his plans to build the wall with federal funds and then seek reimbursement from Mexico, an idea Mexico has rejected. But negotiations, he said, would begin \"relatively soon.\"\n\n\"I'm telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also for the first time appeared to articulate on Wednesday the argument he might make to Mexican officials as he looks to compel them to pay for the wall.\n\nTrump stressed Wednesday that the wall would \"help Mexico\" by deterring illegal immigration from countries farther South through Mexico.\n\n\"We are going to stabilize on both sides of the border and we also understand that a strong and healthy economy in Mexico is very good for the United States,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump erases doubt about commitment to hardline policies\n\nTrump's actions leave little doubt about whether his immigration policies as president would differ from his campaign rhetoric.\n\nThere remained little question, for example, about whether Trump would push to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants. His increases in the number of border patrol and immigration officers -- adding 10,000 immigration officers to an ICE workforce of just 20,000 -- raised the specter of Trump's campaign promise of mass deportations.\n\nOne of Trump's executive actions was expected to call for tripling \"enforcement and removal operations/agents\" of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which is charged with arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants living in the US. The order also calls for a 5,000-person increase in Customs and Border Protection personnel.\n\nMarielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, called Trump's actions Wednesday \"extremist, ineffective and expensive\" and accused the President of using lies about immigrants to drive US policy.\n\n\"Trump is taking a wrecking ball to our immigration system. It shouldn't come as a surprise that chaos and destruction will be the outcome,\" Hincapi\u00e9 said, adding that her organization has already drafted legal papers to challenge Trump's moves.\n\nAnd Greisa Martinez, advocacy director at the United We Dream Network, argued that Trump's moves \"lay the groundwork for mass deportation.\"\n\nTrump's executive orders on Wednesday did not address those of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, which safeguard undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children or who are parents of lawful US residents from deportation. Trump during his campaign signaled he would repeal those orders.\n\nNew criteria for deportation priorities\n\nTrump also outlined new criteria for determining which undocumented immigrants should be prioritized for deportation, putting hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions more people at the top of the federal government's list of people to deport.\n\nAny undocumented immigrant convicted or simply charged with a crime that hasn't been adjudicated could be deported under the Trump administration's new policy.\n\nUnder Obama, only undocumented immigrants convicted of a felony, serious misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanor were considered priorities for deportation.\n\nNew priorities for deportation under Trump also include any undocumented immigrants who abuse public benefits, or simply those considered \"a risk to public safety or national security... in the judgment of an immigration officer\" -- an entirely open-ended premise.\n\nTrump's hardline immigration rhetoric and policy proposals during the campaign often put him at odds not only with Democrats but with many in his own party who called his proposal to build a wall on the US-Mexico border unnecessary and his calls to deport all undocumented immigrants cruel and unrealistic.\n\nTrump persevered in his hardline rhetoric throughout the campaign, resisting efforts to pivot to a more moderate stance on the issue in the general election despite calls to soften his rhetoric.\n\nNow, his actions on Wednesday took a big first step toward satisfying his political base of support that hitched to his campaign amid Trump's bold promises of building a wall, deporting undocumented immigrants and in the process creating a safer country, despite a total lack of evidence tying undocumented immigrants to higher crime rates.\n\nTrump catapulted his campaign into controversy and relevance with his announcement speech in June 2015, in which he pledged some of the hardline immigration policies he was set to enact and decried undocumented immigrants as criminals and \"rapists.\" Trump never apologized for those comments.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.7142858505249, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1017, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 16, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 8.90352330669, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 30, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 30, "mft_sum": 66, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.48967551622419, "mft_mean": 6.0}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/17/opinions/obama-europe-andelman-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Obama has shown he still believes in Europe", "wordcount_as_scraped": 827, "date": "20161119190000", "story_content": "With much of Europe torturing itself, wondering where the United States stands these days on the future of the continent and a union that appears increasingly fragile, President Barack Obama's choice of Greece and Germany was a most adroit selection for his last overseas trip.\n\nBy visiting these two countries, the President is sending a signal of thinly disguised support for the European experiment -- and for those who lead it.\n\nThis trip is a final greeting card for what -- despite all of Europe's problems, from Brexit to the plummeting euro -- has been a close and profitable trans-Atlantic relationship. Clearly, Obama hopes that relationship will continue, with or without a trans-Atlantic trade pact or the United Kingdom as a part of the European Union.\n\n\"A strong and integrated and united Europe is essential to American national security and to global security and stability,\" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, observed in a briefing before the President's departure, adding that Obama's aim is \"to reinforce our support for the approaches that have been taken over the last eight years to try to promote economic growth, economic security and global cooperation on a whole range of issues.\"\n\nReassuring words for a continent torn with conflicting tensions and challenges, which many fear President-elect Donald Trump seems to have given little thought, at least for the moment. But Rhodes noted, \"We have one president at a time.\" And this President is playing to an eager and receptive audience.\n\nFirst he went to Greece, where Obama is the first US president to visit since Bill Clinton in 1999. Financially, Greece is still the sick man of Europe, and from his opening discussions there, Obama reinforced the importance of the world, but particularly Europe, coming to the financial aid of the country that is also a strategic gateway to the continent -- and the NATO alliance.\n\nGreece has also been a first landing point in Europe for a tsunami of refugees from Syria, Iraq and beyond. With the United States still reluctant to take more than a symbolic handful and with the president-designate threatening to cut that number to zero, Obama's is a critical message of support for a country that is trying desperately to find a humane way to cope with and pass along a tide of humanity that no one seems to want.\n\nFinally, there's the ongoing tension between Greece and Turkey -- the only ongoing feud among NATO allies. The two neighbors still share the tensely divided island of Cyprus. This week's state visit is another strong signal as to which side Obama has chosen in the aftermath of a Turkish political crisis that seems to be spinning rapidly into a nasty dictatorship.\n\nHe ends his final visit to Europe in Germany, the country that works so hard to solve many of these issues. Its leader, Angela Merkel, agreed to bankroll a succession of Greek bailouts, accepted by far the largest share of refugees of any European nation, and has for years played mediator between Greece and Turkey.\n\nPolitically, the Obama trip comes at an opportune moment for the continent as a host of right-wing opposition groups seize on the Trump victory as a signal that their own political prospects may be on the rise.\n\nIn Germany, Merkel has decided to stand for a fourth term as Chancellor, but she faces a host of demons, not least the Alternative for Germany, the anti-immigrant party that recently entered Berlin's state parliament after winning 14% of the vote.\n\nIn Greece, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has managed to hang onto his office for a remarkable 14 months, by dint of a coalition of his left-wing Syriza party with the tiny Independent Greeks. But there are other forces out there waiting eagerly in the wings, such as the far-right Golden Dawn Party, which immediately upon Trump's election, attributed his victory to \"the forces which oppose globalization, are fighting illegal migration and are in favor of clean ethnic states, in favor of self-sufficiency in the national economy.\"\n\nBut on Tuesday, standing next to the Greek leader at a press conference, Obama minced no words as he warned that Europeans \"are less certain of their national identities or their place in the world\" these days. \"It starts looking different and disorienting. And there is no doubt that has produced populist movements, both from the left and the right,\" he said. \"That sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity. And that can be a volatile mix.\"\n\nThe problems that Europe faces are real and immediate -- and unlikely to dissipate before the end of the Obama presidency. But the continent, especially those clinging so desperately to what appears to be an increasingly fragile reed of federalism as the solution to so many of its problems, needs every reinforcement it can get as it heads into increasingly stormy seas and a string of national elections that could decide the future of the union itself.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.2415349483490001, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 808, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.40636254458, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161119190000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9702970297029703, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/opinions/trump-travel-ban-christians-swain-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Trump's order is a balm for Christians, not a ban on Muslims", "wordcount_as_scraped": 872, "date": "20170130190000", "story_content": "Last Friday, President Trump signed an executive order titled: \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.\" In the following days, mass hysteria and an onslaught of misleading news reports have falsely depicted the President's actions as an unconstitutional ban on Muslims entering the United States. \n\nThose who object to the order have missed both the actual content of the executive order and the fact that the seven Muslim nations most affected -- Iraq, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen -- were already identified when Congress passed the \"Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015.\" This act prevented nationals of these countries from traveling to the United States without visas. Muslims from other nations like Indonesia, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia are not subject to Trump's 90-day restriction. Therefore, it is not a Muslim ban. \n\nThe quick and immediate effort to implement the President's order created an unexpected amount of chaos and confusion after Administration officials misinterpreted the directive, thinking it applies to green card holders. However, the language of the directive makes clear that these immigrant categories were not the intended target, even green card holders that have been associated with domestic terrorism. It is important to read the text of the executive order before making claims about the Trump Administration's targets and its intended goals. \n\nIn section 1, which references 9/11, the order reads:\n\n\"In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including \"honor\" killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.\"\n\nThe purpose is clear and the goals are well within the scope of presidential authority. Moreover, the criteria listed are consistent with American values and principles. Only the most ardent cultural relativist would have reasons to quibble.  \n\nIn addition to imposing a temporary ban on persons from terrorist-sponsoring nations and halting refugee admissions for 120 days until measures can be implemented to improve the vetting process, President Trump proposes to reduce the flow of immigrants to the United States. He hopes to lessen the number of refugees from President Obama's 2016 85,000 and 2017's 110,000 per year to a more reasonable flow of 50,000 per year, which is still high by historical standards. Reducing the number of refugees strikes me as reasonable, given the limited resources for refugee resettlement and the enormous burden imposed on local communities that are often ill-equipped to absorb large numbers of people from radically different cultural backgrounds. \n\nSome people argue that restricting refugees from Syrian and other terrorist sponsoring nations is heartless because many of the persons admitted are women and children. However, there is a serious problem with this argument: there are more male than female refugees. As Megan McArdle of Bloomberg highlights, Europe's immigration statistics have shown that only 27 percent of refugees were female in 2015. Additionally, jihadists groups have increasingly used women and children to carry out attacks. Women bombers have been successful because they can get closer to their targets, as they are considered less suspicious. Thus, it makes perfect sense for our government to strongly vet all Muslim immigrants, including the women and children. \n\nPresident Trump has also been condemned for signaling he will give priority to persecuted religious minorities in the Middle East, which means admitting higher numbers of Christian and Yazidi refugees fleeing beheadings, drownings, and other forms of mass torture. Some critics have mistakenly argued that religion should not be a factor in refugee admissions.  However, as attorney David French points out, \"Religious considerations are by law part of refugee policy. And it is entirely reasonable to give preference... to members of minority religions.\"\n\nUnder President Obama's policy, over 98 percent of the Middle Eastern refugees were Muslims. Although the Pew Research Center reports that similar numbers of Muslim and Christian refugees entered the US in 2016, their presentation of worldwide statistics rather than regional obscures the discrimination against Christians in the Middle East. Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, argued that it was almost impossible for a Christian refugee to escape Syria. According to Abrams, although 10 percent of all Syrians are Christian, only one-half of 1 percent of the refugees admitted to the US by fall of 2016 were Christian. Clearly, something has been wrong and we needed a corrective like President Trump's order.\n\nInstead of complaining about President Trump's executive order preventing terrorist attacks from foreign nationals, when we invoke the words 'We the People,' we should celebrate the fact we have someone in the White House willing to go the extra mile to ensure the safety of our citizens. We should be thankful for the development and implementation of a rational refugee policy that will correct some of the biases and injustices of the Obama Administration.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.75916242599487, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 872, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 14, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.6772709076300005, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 12, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 62, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170130190000, "FairnessVice": 4, "pct_mft_words": 7.11009174311927, "mft_mean": 5.6363636363600005}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/09/health/buzz-aldrin-hospital-released/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "A week after Antarctica evacuation, Buzz Aldrin released from hospital", "wordcount_as_scraped": 681, "date": "20161209200000", "story_content": "Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin has been released from a hospital in New Zealand and is on a flight back to the United States, according to a tweet from his manager, Christina Korp. \n\nAldrin, 86, was hospitalized in Christchurch on December 2 after being evacuated from the South Pole when his medical condition deteriorated. He was part of a tourist group visiting Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station through luxury tourism company White Desert. The trip was expected to last through December 12. \n\nHe had congestion in his lungs and was told not to take the long flight home until it had cleared, Korp posted on Aldrin's website. \n\n\"I started to feel a bit short of breath so the staff decided to check my vitals,\" Aldrin said on the website. \"After some examination they noticed congestion in my lungs and that my oxygen levels were low which indicated symptoms of altitude sickness. This prompted them to get me out on the next flight to McMurdo and once I was at sea level I began to feel much better.\"\n\n'I'm extremely grateful'\n\n A White Desert doctor and the US Antarctic Program doctor decided an evacuation would the best precautionary measure, according to a release from the company. The tourism operator made a request for a medical evacuation to the National Science Foundation, and it agreed. \n\nAldrin was placed on the first available flight to McMurdo Station, on the Antarctic coast. A US Antarctic Program doctor traveled with him. From McMurdo, another flight took Aldrin to New Zealand. \n\n\"I'm extremely grateful to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for their swift response and help in evacuating me from the Admunsen-Scott Science Station to McMurdo Station and on to New Zealand. I had been having a great time with the group at White Desert's camp before we ventured further south,\" Aldrin said. \"I really enjoyed the time I spent talking with the Science Station's staff too.\"\n\nSeven Corners, the travel insurance company responsible for Aldrin's care, worked directly with Aldrin to monitor on-site medical care and arrange travel for his family, according to a statement from the company. They also helped coordinate his transportation with a medical escort back to the US.\n\nAldrin was eager to visit the South Pole to cap his personal exploration achievements, according to Korp. After all, he had spacewalked and was the second man to walk on the moon in the 1960s, traveled underwater to see the Titanic in 1996 and visited the North Pole in 1998. And to scientists, Antarctica's conditions are similar to what they expect on the surface of Mars.\n\n\"I didn't get as much time to spend with the scientists as I would have liked to discuss the research they're doing in relation to Mars,\" Aldrin said. \"My visit was cut short and I had to leave after a couple of hours. I really enjoyed my short time in Antarctica and seeing what life could be like on Mars.\"\n\nRemembering John Glenn\n\nAldrin also honored his friend, former astronaut and US senator John Glenn, who died Thursday. \n\n\"As I sit in hospital and just heard that my friend John Glenn has passed away, I feel fortunate to be recovering from my own illness, but saddened that we lost another space pioneer and world icon,\" Aldrin said on his website.\n\nAldrin met Glenn in 1953, when Aldrin was a fighter pilot in South Korea and Glenn was the Ops officer. They would meet again as astronauts. He said the last time they saw each other was at former astronaut Neil Armstrong's memorial in 2012, but they had kept in touch by phone and email. \n\n\"I was very saddened to hear that John was ill over the past year,\" Aldrin said. \"Since he was the last remaining Mercury astronaut, I was always lobbying him to encourage the Apollo guys to do regular reunions annually since we're not getting any younger.

Jeff Sessions -- Donald Trump's nominee to be attorney general as the successor of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, the first African-American male and female to hold that office, will slow, if not halt, the momentum gained during the last eight years to reform our criminal justice system.\n\nHolder and Lynch prioritized combating racial profiling and selective policing within communities of color. \n\nIn a twist of fate, by contrast, Sen. Sessions' judicial appointment by President Reagan to the federal bench stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee -- the very committee on which Sessions now sits. Their refusal to confirm him was largely the result of a number of racially charged statements Sessions allegedly made in the 1980s.\n\nBut a man who, because of those statements, was previously deemed unfit to preside over a court of law, may now preside over the Department of Justice, placing the future of any progress made on Holder's and Lynch's watch in doubt. \n\nSessions' statements will most assuredly be used as Democratic fodder during his confirmation hearing. But with a Republican majority, the confirmation hearing will largely be a formality. \n\nHis rhetoric will, however, have a big impact on minority perceptions of the prominent civil rights agenda of the Department of Justice, which has gained increased visibility and scrutiny in an era of publicized police shootings. \n\nUnder Attorneys General Holder and Lynch, the Department of Justice has made powerful strides to restore racial minorities' faith in the criminal justice system.\n\nThey acted with an eye toward reversing the devastating impact that President Bill Clinton's omnibus crime bill had on communities of color, and reducing the astronomical incarceration rate that resulted from harsher penalties imposed for possession and distribution of crack cocaine (more prevalent in economically disadvantaged communities of color) than those imposed for powder cocaine (which was more prevalent within affluent white communities).\n\nYet even under successive African-American attorneys general, the widely publicized use of excessive and deadly force by police officers against unarmed black men, and the seeming inability of local prosecutors to secure convictions against those officers, has all but depleted the faith of communities of color in the department's ability achieve its mission. \n\nIndeed, the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division was intended to act as a backstop against failed state prosecutions and serve as a neutral advocate for communities who feared that the objectivity of local prosecutors would be compromised by personal relationships or prejudices.\n\nBut with each failure to indict, mistrial and acquittal, the department has been criticized for its lack of effectiveness to ensure justice for communities of color. \n\nStill, Holder and Lynch were vocal about their intolerance of civil rights violations. They were vocal even when they recognized the limitations on their ability to prosecute such violations under a body of Supreme Court precedent that is overwhelmingly deferential to police officers' assessment of the appropriate amount of force to use. \n\nThe perception of a powerful and conscientious watchdog in the Justice Department's top job gave communities hope for the future and tempered the backlash in response to perceived miscarriages of justice.\n\nSurely Jeff Sessions, a man accused of calling prominent Civil Rights groups like the NAACP \"un-American,\" and condemning the Klu Klux Klan for supposed marijuana use (rather than its legacy of hate), will further undermine the African-American community's faith that his department will act in -- let alone prioritize -- the interests of communities of color.\n\nBut if the presidential election has taught us anything, it is that offensive rhetoric, perhaps even 30 years removed, may be wholly irrelevant to people who prioritize other issues more.\n\nFrankly, it remains to be seen what types of criminal prosecutions Sen. Sessions will indeed prioritize, but he has already shown his hand as a political operator.  Remember when then-candidate Trump promised to instruct his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton? Sen. Sessions has already called for a deeper investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Attorney General Sessions would have prosecutorial power. \n\nMore than anything, Sessions' appointment is an obvious forecast of the impending ideological shift across multiple branches of government.\n\nWith one Supreme Court vacancy in hand, and perhaps another two in the bush, Sessions' nomination signals that President-elect Trump is prioritizing a reversion back to a time when America, and its justice system, was \"great.\" Sen. Session reiterated that same message on Trump's campaign trail.  When it comes to prosecuting civil rights violations, let's hope Sen. Sessions' reference point of greatness is at least in this century.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.1282052993774405, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 755, "FairnessVirtue": 17, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.21916367069, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161119030000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.63576158940397, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/27/us/mall-disturbances-after-christmas/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3595]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 582, "scraper_regex": 1196}}, "headline": "Mall mayhem: Fights break out across the US", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1196, "date": "20161227090000", "story_content": "Massive brawls and food-court fights played out at more than a dozen malls across the country in what proved to be a chaotic day after Christmas.\n\nSome of the mayhem was captured on social media.

The teens were taking into custody Monday evening after police received a call for assistance at the shopping center\"due to an unruly crowd in the common area,\" police said. \n\n\"All of the charges lodged are misdemeanors, however, police are not ruling out enhancing them to felonies,\" the statement said. More arrests are possible, police said. \n\nMoments after the call, a fight broke out in the food court area and those were followed by several other smaller altercations, the Aurora police said. \n\nThe brawl forced evacuations and the mall closed. No injuries were reported in the incident.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee\n\nIn Memphis, seven people were arrested after incidents at two malls, CNN affiliate WMC reported. \n\nPolice said a group started a disturbance in the Wolfchase Galleria food court and started running, which prompted some customers to call 911, WMC said. \n\nThen a crowd gathered outside Oak Court Mall, about 10 miles west, and started a disturbance, WMC said. Both malls were cleared and closed early for the night.\n\nShots were reported in both incidents, but police said they found no evidence of gunfire, WMC said.\n\nNo injuries were reported, CNN affiliate WATN said.\n\nChattanooga, Tennessee\n\nLoud sounds kicked off a wave of panic at Hamilton Place Mall, in Chattanooga, Tennessee. \n\nSeveral people were pushed to the ground as shoppers rushed to exit the mall, police said.   \n\nOfficers rushed to the scene after receiving reports of \"shots fired,\" but the sounds turned out to be fireworks.\n\nUPDATE: 20 firecrackers were discharged in Pink causing confusion. 3 injuries are reported, 0 serious.\u00a0Mall is returning to normal operation\u2014 Hamilton Place (@HamiltonPlaceTN) December 26, 2016\n\n\"Our investigation concluded that it was perpetrated a group of individuals who were setting off fireworks, possibly to coverup the actions of a shoplifting crime,\" the Chattanooga Police Department said in a statement. \n\nMinor injuries were reported after the incident. \n\nPolice have descriptions of the suspects involved in this incident and video footage, the statement said.  \n\nFayetteville, North Carolina\n\nIn Fayetteville, North Carolina, people panicked after teenagers fought in the food court, Fayetteville police spokesman Shawn Strepay  told CNN affiliate WRAL.

Witnesses said  they thought they had heard shots fired. That, along with a fight, led to what Elizabeth police Officer Greg Jones described as a \"chaotic panic and everybody running all at once.\" \n\nUltimately, though, patrons had mistaken the sound of a chair slammed during a fight for gunfire, city officials told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey. Two people, an 8-year-old and 12-year-old, were injured, the station reported.\n\nManchester, Connecticut \n\nAmateur video taken from inside Buckland Hills Mall, in Manchester, Connecticut, shows people screaming as punches were being thrown inside the shops on the day after Christmas.\n\n\"It was estimated that there were several hundred teenagers inside the mall and several other fights broke out around the same time,\" the Manchester Police Department said in a statement. \n\nNo weapons were involved, but one Manchester police officer was assaulted while trying to break up a first fight, police said. The officer did not sustain any significant injuries. \n\nFort Worth, Texas\n\nThe security guards had no other choice but to place the Hulen Mall on lockdown. At one point, police told CNN affiliate KTVT, at least 100 people were involved in a series of fights.\n\nFort Worth Police spokeswoman Tamara Velle said officers initially responded to reported gunfire inside the mall.

The Food and Drug Administration recently banned it, along with 18 other chemicals, from hand soaps because of unacceptable risks to humans and the environment. \n\nExposure to triclosan in general is linked with disruption of hormone function and the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.\n\nThe FDA asked manufacturers to demonstrate that these chemicals are safe for long-term use and more effective than regular soap. Neither has been proven.\n\nBut these same chemicals are still used in many other products -- including plush toys, pool wings, pacifier pockets, building blocks and even craft supplies like markers and scissors -- without any label required. Some of these products are marketed as being antimicrobial, but many aren't.\n\nBecause these products are not under the purview of the FDA, they aren't subject to the ban, and companies aren't required to reveal what makes them antimicrobial. This means it is hard for consumers to know what products contain these chemicals.\n\nWhy was triclosan banned in soaps?\n\nManufacturers failed to demonstrate that antimicrobial soaps were any more effective than regular soaps. Essentially, there are no reported benefits of antimicrobial soaps to outweigh the risks of using antimicrobial chemicals. So, are these chemicals any more effective in other products?\n\nOverall, peer-reviewed research showing that household products and building materials containing antimicrobial chemicals, such as cutting boards and industrial flooring, harbor fewer bacteria is scant. Research further demonstrating that these products protect human health is essentially nonexistent. This indicates that, much like in soaps, triclosan in other products isn't doing much good.\n\nWhy you should dispense with antibacterial soaps\n\nThe FDA's decision applies only to over-the-counter soaps sold to consumers, and not to soaps used in health care settings or any other consumer products or building materials not under the purview of the FDA.\n\nBut some health care providers are deciding to skip the antimicrobials. For example, Kaiser Permanente, a major health care system, stopped purchasing soaps containing triclosan several years ago. \n\nAnd in 2015 the system announced it would no longer use paint and interior building products containing antimicrobial chemicals, citing a lack of evidence that they actually prevent disease along with safety concerns.\n\nNot only does research suggest that antimicrobial products are ineffective at reducing microbes on the product, but several studies also suggest they may be causing an increase in antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic-resistant infections, such as MRSA, cause an estimated 23,000 deaths every year in the United States.\n\nWhy you'd have to eat 64 cans of green beans every day to get too much BPA\n\nResearch that I conducted at the Biology and the Built Environment (BioBE) Center at the University of Oregon demonstrated a troubling link, finding higher concentrations of triclosan and antibiotic resistance genes in dust in an athletic and educational facility. We are currently investigating how these antibiotic resistance genes can get into bacteria.\n\nAt the moment, it's unclear how much of the triclosan we find in dust comes from soaps or other products, but triclosan has been found in almost every dust sample assayed worldwide. This suggests that the more antimicrobial chemicals we use in our homes, classrooms and offices, the more antibiotic-resistant bacteria we see there.\n\nAgain, it is worth noting that we have no evidence that using any antimicrobial products other than toothpaste, whether they are soaps or other household goods, makes us any healthier. There is even some evidence to the contrary: Without adequate exposure to the right microbes, our children may be at a higher risk of developing conditions like allergies and asthma.\n\nWhy it's hard to know what products contain these chemicals\n\nLet's say, then, that we want to avoid products that contain triclosan or any of the other 18 antimicrobials banned in soap by the FDA. Should be fairly easy, right? Not so: Manufacturers are not required to tell us what makes their products antimicrobial.\n\nSoaps are personal care products, which means they fall under the FDA's jurisdiction. The agency requires that active ingredients such as triclosan be listed. For instance, triclosan is also found in some toothpastes, in which it has been proven effective against plaque, and it is listed on the label.\n\nIf you want to avoid buying soaps containing these chemicals before the ban goes into effect on Sept. 6 you just need to read the label. But products that are not under the agency's jurisdiction are subject to different requirements, and don't have to list the chemicals they contain. It is incredibly difficult -- if not impossible -- to find out exactly which products contain which antimicrobial chemicals.\n\nProducts that are marketed as being antimicrobial, for instance, often contain these chemicals. But not all products that contain antimicrobial chemicals are advertised as such.\n\nConcerned consumers can get recommendations from advocacy groups like the Environmental Working Group and Beyond Pesticides. However, that information is focused largely on triclosan and not the additional 18 chemicals banned from soap. And as manufacturers reformulate products without making public announcements, information may be incomplete or out of date.\n\nConsumers looking for a simple way to get comprehensive information about antimicrobial products are out of luck. But one consumer with an awful lot of resources is actually starting to collect this information: Google. The tech giant went to such great lengths to uncover the ingredients for products used in their facilities that it developed an online tool called Portico.

In an election hinging on voter perceptions of character and trustworthiness, the move revived memories of yet another political fracas surrounding the Clinton family. \n\nThat leaves the FBI in an unprecedented position: very publicly at the center of a presidential race one week out from the election. The apolitical agency's actions over the past four days are leaving the FBI exposed to arguments from Democrats -- and some Republicans -- that it is improperly intervening in the fight between Clinton and Trump. \n\nAnd it ensures that Comey, who was once a registered Republican and contributed to GOP nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney, will remain in the spotlight for the remainder of the campaign.\n\nHillary Clinton's challenge: Shift focus back to Trump\n\n\"It's another very puzzling development. We are in the final stages of an important presidential campaign,\" Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic congressman from New York who supports Clinton, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room.\" \"Because of the FBI's actions, we are talking about emails, Anthony Weiner and a 15-year-old pardon.\"\n\nHe continued: \"That doesn't make any sense and it undermines the integrity of the democratic process. The FBI and the director owe the American people an explanation as to what is going on.\"\n\nNo political motive\n\nThe FBI sought to make clear there was no political motive around the sudden appearance of the Rich documents, saying they were released in line with procedures relating to Freedom of Information Act filings.\n\n\"These materials became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the FBI's public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures,\" the statement said.\n\nBut before the statement, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon questioned the timing of the release \u2014 nearly 16 years after Bill Clinton left the White House but only seven days before the election involving his wife.\n\n\"Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd. Will FBI be posting docs on Trump's housing discrimination in '70s?\" Fallon tweeted.\n\nComey, the most powerful FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover, has long been seen as someone who plays it by the book.

Director Comey has called for transparency, but has now withdrawn from public view,\" Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement. \"The American people need to know why he decided to withhold information about Russian interference while reigniting email hysteria without any substantiation.\u00a0He needs to clean up this mess.\"\n\nThe FBI has been conducting multiple investigations that include allegations of connections between Russia and\u00a0the Trump campaign or people who support his candidacy, according to CNN sources. None so far have yielded proof of criminal connections between the Russian government and the Republican nominee or his campaign.\n\nFormer CIA acting director Michael Morell, a Clinton supporter, vigorously criticized Comey, his former colleague in the intelligence community, over his actions on the email situation.\n\n\"I think he was trying to protect his organization,\" Morell said in an interview with David Axelrod for his \"The Axe Files\" podcast. \"But as (former Attorney General) Eric Holder wrote in The Washington Post over the weekend in response to Comey's actions, people make mistakes. And I think (Comey) made a series of terrible mistakes here.\"\n\nClinton campaign manager Robby Mook also laid into Comey. On CNN's \"New Day,\" he complained of a double standard operating for Clinton and Trump.\n\n\"We just want fairness,\" Mook said. Comey \"thought it was perfectly fine for the FBI to send a letter to Capitol Hill about information they had never looked at and say, 'Hey, we have some information, Republican Chairmen.'\"\n\nBut GOP Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, dismissed suggestions that Comey had parachuted into the final stage of a presidential race to play politics.\n\n'Known for his integrity'\n\n\"When it comes to Jim Comey, I have known him for 20 years,\" McCaul told Blitzer. \"He has always been known for his integrity, a straight shooter ... he is not a partisan guy, you have had Republicans mad at him and now Democrats.\"\n\nAnd one prominent Democrat, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, warned the Clinton campaign's attacks on Comey could backfire.\n\n\"I wouldn't do that,\" Rendell said on 1210 WPHT Philadelphia radio. \"Again, you know, I'm not running the campaign by any means, but I wouldn't do that.\"\n\nRendell, however, allowed that \"the more that comes out about this, the stranger it is,\" he said. \"Like the agents had this material or knew about the existence of the material at the beginning of October and didn't tell the director until the end of October. That makes no sense at all.\"\n\nAmid the political turmoil, Comey came face-to-face with some of his critics Tuesday, including former attorneys general Holder and Michael Mukasey, at a memorial service for former prosecutor David Margolis at the Great Hall of the Justice Department.\n\nNo one mentioned the current storm swirling around the FBI.\n\nBut Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and several other speakers noted the department's ideals of pursuing the rule of law no matter which political party is in power.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.28310513496399, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 984, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.4629485789400003, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161102020000, "PurityVirtue": 3, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 2.74390243902439, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/16/politics/ethics-paperwork-missing-for-billionaire-cabinet-picks/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Ethics paperwork still missing for Trump's billionaire Cabinet picks ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 608, "date": "20170117000000", "story_content": "Several of the wealthiest nominees for top Cabinet posts are headed to Capitol Hill for confirmation hearings this week, but the clock is ticking for them to complete the ethics and financial review process.\n\nOf the current list of 21 nominees, 14 must still sit for Senate hearings, and only five of those 14 have finalized their required paperwork.\n\nAll nominees for Senate-confirmed positions must first work with the Office of Government Ethics to devise a plan for resolving any financial conflicts of interest before they start their new jobs. Typically, the ethics office sends the Senate a package with the nominee's ethics agreement, a financial disclosure report and a cover letter certifying the report after all potential conflicts are addressed, and then posts the forms on its website roughly a day later. \n\nBut the paperwork for two of President-elect Donald Trump's billionaire nominees with hearings scheduled for this week -- namely, Education Secretary-designate Betsy DeVos (up Tuesday) and Commerce Secretary-designate Wilbur Ross (up Wednesday) -- were notably missing from the ethics office's website as of Monday afternoon.\n\nDeVos is an heir to the Amway fortune and Ross is an investor who made his money buying up distressed companies. \n\nA Senate source indicated that DeVos' initial hearing date had to be rescheduled because her paperwork \"was nowhere near ready,\" and Ross had been sluggish in completing his financial disclosure report.\n\nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.\n\nThe nominees' missing paperwork comes at a particularly prickly time for relations between ethics office and the incoming administration. \n\nThe trouble started after the election last November when Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub emailed Trump aides that despite his office's repeated outreach: \"We seem to have lost contact with the Trump-Pence transition since the election.\"\n\n\"Announcing Cabinet picks without taking OGE up on the offer to take an early look at financial disclosure picks poses the risk of embarrassment for the President-elect ... in the event that the individual walks away from the nomination after learning what he or she will have to do with his or her financial interests,\" Shaub wrote.\n\nNevertheless, Senate committees began scheduling hearings for several nominees while the ethics office grew concerned they were not being properly vetted ahead of time.\n\n\"The announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me,\" Shaub wrote in a letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen.

Then, Trump said there were 3 to 5 million illegal votes in the election, costing him the popular vote. Spicer doubled down on this lie in his press briefing, citing debunked theories about voter fraud.\n\nThe first falsehood, on the crowd size, is no big deal in the grand scheme of things, beyond undermining Spicer's credibility. The second lie, on voter fraud, exhibits a disturbing pattern and also lays the groundwork for an assault on voting rights.\n\nWe have seen this game plan before. The entire history of voter ID laws rests on false claims about voter fraud. \n\nIn the 2000 election, Republican John Ashcroft narrowly lost a US Senate election in Missouri to Democrat Mel Carnahan, who had died in a plane crash shortly before Election Day.  On election night, Missouri's senior Senator, Republican Kit Bond, screamed at an Ashcroft rally that \"dogs and dead people\" had cost Ashcroft the election. He pounded the podium and declared, \"This is an outrage!\" \n\nBond had no evidence for his claim that voter fraud had swung the result. But he continued making these arguments on the Senate floor during the debate over the new Help America Vote Act of 2002, which was Congress' response to the 2000 election debacle. He often pointed to the case of Ritzy Mekler, a springer-spaniel who supposedly was on the voter registration rolls in St. Louis.  (Although Ritzy may have been on the registration rolls, there is no evidence that she actually voted). Ultimately Bond persuaded his fellow Republicans to support a federal voter ID requirement for first-time voters who registered by mail. \n\nRepublican-controlled states then took the mantle, passing their own stricter forms of photo identification laws that allow fewer and fewer documents to serve as valid IDs for voting. In 2004, Indiana was the first state to enact a strict photo ID law once Republicans took over the governor's mansion and both houses of the state Legislature for the first time since 1982. \n\nOnce again, Indiana politicians claimed they were trying to root out voter fraud, this time pointing to election fraud in a local Democratic primary that involved absentee balloting. Of course, a photo ID requirement for in-person voting would not prevent absentee balloting fraud.  Nevertheless, Indiana's law, which the US Supreme Court refused to overturn in 2008, served as a model for the rest of the country. Photo ID laws spread, becoming the most significant election administration issue of the past decade, all resting on initial falsehoods about the extent of voter fraud.\n\nStates continue to pass strict photo ID requirements that do not prevent any known voter fraud. The requirements instead disenfranchise valid voters who simply do not have the required ID or would suffer significant hardship in obtaining one. One court found that Texas' law could disenfranchise up to 600,000 valid voters and would disproportionately harm minority populations. Courts throughout the country last year required states to \"soften\"  their laws to try to prevent disenfranchisement. But that did not solve all problems, as confusion and uneven implementation still affected many voters.\n\nTrump's frequent allegations of voter fraud in the 2016 election are not simply innocuous rhetoric from a president upset that he lost the popular vote. It follows a pattern of repeating false claims about voter fraud in an effort to make the public believe something that is verifiably not true. Many Americans think that voter fraud is rampant, despite clear evidence to the contrary. This is probably why most Americans support a voter ID requirement.   But the fact is that in-person impersonation -- the only kind of fraud a photo ID law would root out -- is extremely rare, while disenfranchisement because of strict voter ID laws does occur. \n\nTrump's team members seem to think that if they say it enough times, it must be true. They are banking on the American public actually believing that there were millions of illegal votes, meaning that we have to do something about it. We must not forget: This tactic has worked before, leading to the passage of voter ID laws in dozens of states.\n\nMoreover, Trump has already moved the goalposts: Wednesday morning he tweeted that he would call for an investigation into \"those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal\"   and \"even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time).\" Notice that he is not talking about millions of \"illegal votes\" but inaccurate voter registration rolls. But even if voter registration rolls are bloated, this does not mean these people voted. \n\nAlthough we should do more to streamline the registration process, the fact there may be excess people on the voter registration rolls makes perfect sense under our current system. People move, die and sometimes there may even be improper names when workers conducting voter registration drives are paid per registration and wrongly seek to pad their numbers, without any concern that these people actually vote. Yet the general public will probably think something is amiss simply because the federal government is conducting an investigation.\n\nThe fact is that actual voter fraud on Election Day, although sometimes present in small numbers in local elections, did not materially alter the presidential election. Even the studies  Spicer cited to justify Trump's claim of millions of illegal votes mostly discussed problems with voter registration, not noncitizen voting. \n\nVoter fraud occasionally occurs through absentee balloting or even complicit poll workers, but it is absurd to claim that 3 to 5 million illegal votes -- conveniently a number higher than Hillary Clinton's 3 million popular vote lead -- changed the popular vote in the presidential election, which, in any event, does not have any relevance to the outcome beyond hurting Trump's ego. Even more dangerous is the incorrect message it sends about the extent of voter fraud and the need to enact measures to combat it.\n\nTrump's lies in his first few days are therefore dangerous not only because they undermine the public's faith in the truth of any future message coming from the White House. They also are part of a plan to persuade the public of something that is verifiably wrong so the administration can justify future efforts at partisan-laden voting laws that will harm the right to vote. \n\nThe public should call Trump and Spicer out for these falsehoods. Republicans and Democrats alike should demand that Trump cease making these statements, much like Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham did shortly after Spicer's press briefing. And when the inevitable voter suppression measures are introduced in Congress or state legislatures, we must remember that the justifications for these laws will likely rest on inaccurate missives from the White House.

The good news is that's something we have control over.\"\n\nObama called the four-minute conversation with Putin \"candid and courteous,\" which included discussions on Syria and Ukraine in which the President said he conveyed that he was \"deeply concerned about the bloodshed and chaos that's being sewn by constant bombing attacks by Assad and the Russian military.\" \n\nDefense of the Democratic Party\n\nPresident Obama in Lima took up a strong defense of the Democratic Party, saying that he wasn't \"worried about being the last Democratic president.\" Obama added he he wasn't saying that to be a \"cute\" point to the popular vote, which Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won despite coming up short against Trump in the all-important Electoral College count.  \n\nObama, however, conceded that following Clinton's surprising defeat, Democrats \"have to do some thinking\" about their message. But the President said he didn't believe \"there has to be a complete overhaul.\"\n\nObama also defended the political skill of House Minority Leader Pelosi, but did not weigh in on the challenge to her leadership position in Congress. The longtime California Democrat is facing a leadership fight from Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio.\n\nObama said that the current minority leader \"combines strong progressive values with just extraordinary political skill; and she does stuff that's tough.

signs of stopping, including some high-end luxury options.  \n\nBig chains like the Sheraton and resorts like Mia and Amanoi are already catering to Nha Trang's more upscale market. \n\nIf budget is not an issue and you want indulgence and seclusion, Six Senses Ninh Van Bay offers villas with private pools, starting at $600 dollars per night. \n\nThe resort is not on an island per se, but rather nestled on the remote Ninh Van Bay surrounded by majestic mountains, a 20-minute boat ride from Nha Trang. \n\nA spa, tennis, water-skiing, hiking and even cooking classes are available at the resort. \n\nWhale Island\n\nNha Trang is a vibrant city but it can get crowded and hectic, especially during the holidays. \n\nFor unspoiled beaches and peace and quiet, it's best to hop to a nearby island. \n\nOn the more affordable end is Whale Island, an eco-friendly resort with basic amenities just a two-hour boat ride from Nha Trang. \n\nI explored the island when it first opened years ago and fondly recall how pristine and stunning it was. \n\nThe resort has since updated and expanded its facilities but has kept its no parties, no noise, no frills vibe. \n\nThere's an abundance of activities for nature and water sport lovers, including diving, snorkeling, sailing and kayaking. \n\nMORE: The world's 100 best beaches\n\nHon Tre Island\n\nIf you're traveling with kids and beaches aren't enough to keep them entertained, there's Vinpearl Land on Hon Tre Island. \n\nVietnam's version of Disney World also has a water park, aquarium and clear, calm beach, all in one place for about $30 dollars admission per person.\n\nJust bear in mind this is Vietnam, not Florida. \n\nGuests coming in from the mainland can take the ferry or ride a scenic 3-kilometer cable car over the ocean. \n\nVinpearl has a resort on a separate part of the island complete with a lush 18-hole golf course designed by IMG Worldwide. \n\nMORE: 10 dishes every Vietnam visitor needs to try\n\nPhu Quoc and Con Dao\n\nThe Nha Trang area isn't the only option for island hopping in the south. \n\nAbout an hour flight from Saigon, Phu Quoc and Con Dao were both used as prison islands during French colonial times and the Vietnam War. \n\nThe Phu Quoc Prison museum is worth a visit for those wanting to learn more about the area's past.  \n\nThese days, Phu Quoc -- situated between the Vietnam mainland and Cambodia -- is on some travelers' lists as the island to visit in Southeast Asia. \n\nBest of all, international tourists flying directly to the island only no longer require a visa.\n\nBefore Phu Quoc became a tourist destination, its claim to fame was fish sauce. \n\nProduced on the island, it's considered the best in the world and an essential ingredient in Vietnamese cooking. \n\nThe island has come a long way since the late 1990s when I first visited and fell in love with the place. \n\nBack then, there was no international airport or real hotels, only a few guesthouses. \n\nIn fact, 20 years ago, a British expat living in Saigon enjoyed the island so much but couldn't find adequate accommodation that he and a few partners built some bungalows. \n\nThose bungalows became Mango Bay, an unpretentious resort offering rustic villas in a spacious natural setting. \n\nThere are plenty of other hotels and resorts to choose from on the island, and big names like the J.W. Marriott are currently under construction. \n\nLocated on the south coast, JW Marriott Phu Quoc Emerald Bay was designed by legendary resort architect Bill Bensley and is due to open in late 2017. \n\nThe small island of Con Dao, while developing nowhere near the pace of Phu Quoc, may be the next frontier for Vietnam island hoppers charmed by the idea of exploring a beautiful place before the rest of the world moves in. \n\nDiving here is said to be the best in Vietnam. \n\nThere's no international airport and accommodation is limited, with a Six Senses property and the newly opened Poulo Condor Resort on the more luxury end.  \n\nThese islands, much like Vietnam's history, are a story of rebirth and reinvention, highlighting its ability to rebound from the dust of war.\n\nIn the end, natural beauty prevails.\n\nMORE: Saigon street food: What to eat in Ho Chi Minh City\n\nThe resorts\n\nSheraton Nha Trang Hotel & Spa, 26-28 Tran Phu Street, Nha Trang, +84 (0)58 3880 000\n\nMia Resort Nha Trang, 3 Khuc Thua Du, Phuong Phuoc Long, Nha Trang, +84 (0) 583 989 666 \n\nAmanoi, Vinh Hy Village, Vinh Hai Commune,Ninh Hai, +84 (0)68 3770 777\n\nSix Senses Ninh Van Bay, Ninh Van, Ninh Hoa, +84 (0)58 3728 222\n\nWhale Island Resort, Dam Mon, Van Thanh, Van Ninh, Khanh Hoa, +84 (0)58 3707 118 \n\nMango Bay Resort, Cua Du\u01a1ng, Phu Quoc, Kien Giang, +84 (0)77 3981 693\n\nSix Senses Con Dao, Dat Doc Beach, Con Dao Dist, Con Son, +84 (0)64 3831 222\n\nPoulo Condor Resort and Spa, Con Son, +84 (0)8 3822 3625", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.69058299064636, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1032, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.1354541815299999, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161219020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.7751937984496121, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/12/opinions/new-direction-for-democrats-tasini/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Democrats, we need this new direction", "wordcount_as_scraped": 925, "date": "20161113000000", "story_content": "After Tuesday's election, Republicans will continue to hold power in 67 of the 98 state chambers, and, for the first time in history, will control every statehouse in the South. Republicans also upped their control of governors' mansions to 33 by winning races in Missouri, Vermont and New Hampshire (the North Carolina race is still undecided). \n\nFinally, notwithstanding tiny gains Tuesday by Democrats in congressional races, Republicans still hold a near-record margin in the House of Representatives (because of the 2010 shellacking in which Republicans gained 63 seats) and will likely increase their slim Senate majority in 2018 when the electoral map appears quite hostile to Democrats.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Democratic Party has shrinking power and influence over the shaping of public policy. \n\nThis new era of Republican control in Washington has startled -- some might say shocked -- many Democrats. However, looking a bit deeper, it shouldn't be a surprise; the party's national leadership has been a colossal failure for a long time. That makes the choice of who will lead the Democratic National Committee -- and steer the direction of a renewed party -- a matter of survival. \n\n And it has only itself to blame. This isn't simply a reflection of the incompetence of DNC leaders such as Debbie Wasserman Schultz, or the foisting on us of a truly weak presidential candidate. It goes to the core of what the party stands for and the guiding principles of its leaders.\n\nWe need new leadership, and as Sen. Bernie Sanders has argued persuasively, Rep. Keith Ellison fits that bill.\n\nAs I wrote this week, for a quarter of a century, the party embraced Clintonomics as a central guiding principle. Clintonomics, boiled down to its essence, is a kinder, gentler neoliberal philosophy: It embraces so-called free trade, deregulation, extols the free market and worships the \"honest\" financial sector (partly for campaign contributions), all with a light touch of regulation and meek taxes on the wealthy.\n\nBut that philosophy has been a resounding failure, not just in this country but around the world. Seeds of the revolt against Clinton-like neoliberalism can be found in the many rejections of governments in Europe and elsewhere. And, indeed, that anger, in many instances, has spawned Trump-like racism and bigotry.\n\nWhen Wasserman Schultz was shown the door (because of her manipulation of the party's primary contest on behalf of Hillary Clinton -- and because the party lost 910 state legislative seats during Barack Obama's presidency, the names of a number of possible replacements surfaced. Those included elected officials, longtime party activists and some leaders of Democratic-affiliated organizations. Most of them are precisely not the people the party needs. \n\nIt's not that former governors, past members of Congress or heads of advocacy groups are not competent. It is that they have either been longtime advocates of Clintonomics or, while the party spiraled downward in loss after loss because neoliberalism-lite alienated voters who had been robbed of their jobs and livelihoods, they sat silently at the DNC or in Washington.\n\nFormer Vermont Gov. Howard Dean is now in the race. Dean is running on his past advocacy of a 50-state political strategy and an undeserved reputation as a progressive. I give credit to Dean for speaking up against the Iraq War when, in the wake of 9/11, most Democrats were cowering before George W. Bush. \n\nBut, on economics, he was a pretty moderate governor who embraced most of the failed principles of Clintonomics. More recently, he's turned into a classic political insider. He's been working for a firm that lobbies the health care industry. He is the absolute wrong person to head up the party.\n\nEllison, however, is the right DNC chair to lead the party forward. He represents an urban-suburban district in Minnesota that is quite diverse: two-thirds white, 18% black, 9% Hispanic and 5% Asian. He is a Muslim. In other words, he understands, and can speak to, a huge swath of the public on matters of justice, race and tolerance.\n\nEllison was one of the few elected officials to support Sanders. But more important he rejects the model of the Democrats as a big-donor, Wall Street-driven party. As co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus -- the largest Democratic caucus -- Ellison has espoused for many years the principles that Sanders ran on in 2016, principles I believe would have carried Sanders to the White House had he been the Democratic nominee: Medicare for all, free college tuition, expanded Social Security benefits (in contrast to the hand-wringing, and factually incorrect, \"crisis\" rhetoric too many Democrats spew about Social Security), reining in and cutting down the size of the financial sector and a rational foreign policy where diplomacy is paramount.\n\nSome of the more traditional party bigwigs seem to be waking up to Ellison's vision. Sen. Charles Schumer, perhaps the most visible Democrat with longstanding ties to Wall Street, endorsed him. My hunch is that Schumer, a fairly canny political operative, sees two trends. He came up short in his quest to become majority leader because Democrats did not connect with the economic-based anger coursing through many key states. He also understands that the progressive wing in the Senate caucus -- led by Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown -- is ascendant, and he will need their loyalty to stay in his perch as Senate party leader.\n\nThe position of DNC chair is not the only important choice facing the party. But, in the aftermath of the recent election, it will send a signal that Democrats have consigned Clintonomics to the sidelines and are moving forward with a different agenda.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.8919722437858578, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 925, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.00206558237, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161113000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 7, "pct_mft_words": 3.8918918918918903, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/10/politics/ash-carter-us-troops-syria/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 552, "scraper_regex": 591}}, "headline": "US to deploy up to 200 more troops to Syria", "wordcount_as_scraped": 591, "date": "20161210090000", "story_content": "Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said Saturday the US would send up to 200 additional US troops to Syria to help train and assist US-backed local forces that are driving towards ISIS' self-declared capital in Raqqa, Syria.\n\n\"The United States will deploy approximately 200 additional US forces to Syria,\" Carter said, adding that the new contingent would include special operations forces, trainers, advisers, and explosive ordinance disposal teams.\n\n\"This latest commitment of additional forces within Syria is another important step in enabling our partners to deal ISIL a lasting defeat,\" Carter said, using the government's preferred acronym for the terror organization.\n\nCarter made the announcement while speaking at the Manama Dialogue, a regional security summit hosted in the capital of the Gulf state of Bahrain. \n\nThe decision will nearly double the number of US troops authorized to operate in Syria.

Carter called it \"the largest airstrike of this kind to date.\"\n\nBut US military officials anticipate a tougher fight in the days ahead.\n\n\"Daesh considers Raqqa their capital in Syria, so we expect resistance to stiffen as forces move closer to the city,\" Dorrian told reporters last month, using another name for the terror group.\n\nAnd even after Raqqa and Mosul are captured, Carter predicted that the fight against ISIS would continue for some time.\n\n\"There will still be much more to do after that to make sure that once defeated, ISIL stays defeated,\" he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.23367691040039, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 552, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.30701409826, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161210090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.7173913043478297, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/24/africa/nigeria-security-forces-biafra-protesters/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 606, "scraper_regex": 640}}, "headline": "Nigerian officers killed 150 peaceful protesters, Amnesty report claims", "wordcount_as_scraped": 640, "date": "20161125000000", "story_content": "Nigerian security forces have killed at least 150 people in a series of attacks against the largely peaceful pro-Biafra secessionist movement, according to a report by Amnesty International. \n\nThe report finds \"overwhelming evidence that Nigerian security forces committed gross human rights violations\" at a number of public gatherings in the country's southern region since August 2015.\n\nIn what the human rights group calls \"a chilling campaign,\" security forces were apparently responsible for the extrajudicial killings, detentions, and torture of supporters of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a group that is pushing for an independent Biafran state in Nigeria's oil-rich southeast.\n\n\"This deadly repression of pro-Biafra activists is further stoking tensions in the southeast of Nigeria,\" said Makmid Kamara, Interim Director of Amnesty International Nigeria.\n\n\"This reckless and trigger-happy approach to crowd control has caused at least 150 deaths and we fear the actual total might be far higher,\" Kamara said.\n\nSecurity force abuses\n\nThe report was based on the analysis of 87 videos and 122 photographs, along with 146 witness interviews.\n\nIt states that many of the abuses occurred around the Biafra Remembrance Day celebrations on May 30, 2016, in Onitsha, Anambra State.

The orders also call for stripping sanctuary cities of federal grant funding and announced sweeping new criteria that could make many more undocumented immigrants priorities for deportation.\n\n\"Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders,\" Trump told employees of the Department of Homeland Security at the department's headquarters in Washington.\n\nBut while Trump directed the \"immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border,\" the executive orders do not cover the cost of the wall. Trump has repeatedly promised that Mexico will reimburse US taxpayers for the construction costs, a suggestion Mexican officials have rejected out of hand.\n\nThe president's moves sent alarm bells ringing in immigrant activist circles, where questions had continued to swirl about whether Trump would truly implement many of the hard-line immigration policies he articulated during his campaign. \n\nTrump also indicated he does not need Congress to pass new legislation to implement the border control and immigration reform agenda he outlined during his campaign for president, saying he would \"work within the existing system and framework.\"\n\n\"We do not need new laws,\" Trump said soon after signing the two executive orders.\n\nThe executive orders Trump signed Wednesday call for boosting the ranks of Border Patrol forces by an additional 5,000 agents as well as for 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to carry out deportations. The orders noted that the increases were subject to Congress's appropriation of sufficient funds.\n\nBuilding the wall\n\nConstruction of the wall could begin in months, but planning for the massive project is \"starting immediately,\" Trump said Wednesday in an interview with ABC News.\n\nTrump confirmed his plans to build the wall with federal funds and then seek reimbursement from Mexico, an idea Mexico has rejected. But negotiations, he said, would begin \"relatively soon.\"\n\n\"I'm telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also for the first time appeared to articulate on Wednesday the argument he might make to Mexican officials as he looks to compel them to pay for the wall.\n\nTrump stressed Wednesday that the wall would \"help Mexico\" by deterring illegal immigration from countries farther South through Mexico.\n\n\"We are going to stabilize on both sides of the border and we also understand that a strong and healthy economy in Mexico is very good for the United States,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump erases doubt about commitment to hardline policies\n\nTrump's actions leave little doubt about whether his immigration policies as president would differ from his campaign rhetoric.\n\nThere remained little question, for example, about whether Trump would push to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants. His increases in the number of border patrol and immigration officers -- adding 10,000 immigration officers to an ICE workforce of just 20,000 -- raised the specter of Trump's campaign promise of mass deportations.\n\nOne of Trump's executive actions was expected to call for tripling \"enforcement and removal operations/agents\" of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which is charged with arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants living in the US. The order also calls for a 5,000-person increase in Customs and Border Protection personnel.\n\nMarielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, called Trump's actions Wednesday \"extremist, ineffective and expensive\" and accused the President of using lies about immigrants to drive US policy.\n\n\"Trump is taking a wrecking ball to our immigration system. It shouldn't come as a surprise that chaos and destruction will be the outcome,\" Hincapi\u00e9 said, adding that her organization has already drafted legal papers to challenge Trump's moves.\n\nAnd Greisa Martinez, advocacy director at the United We Dream Network, argued that Trump's moves \"lay the groundwork for mass deportation.\"\n\nTrump's executive orders on Wednesday did not address those of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, which safeguard undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children or who are parents of lawful US residents from deportation. Trump during his campaign signaled he would repeal those orders.\n\nNew criteria for deportation priorities\n\nTrump also outlined new criteria for determining which undocumented immigrants should be prioritized for deportation, putting hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions more people at the top of the federal government's list of people to deport.\n\nAny undocumented immigrant convicted or simply charged with a crime that hasn't been adjudicated could be deported under the Trump administration's new policy.\n\nUnder Obama, only undocumented immigrants convicted of a felony, serious misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanor were considered priorities for deportation.\n\nNew priorities for deportation under Trump also include any undocumented immigrants who abuse public benefits, or simply those considered \"a risk to public safety or national security... in the judgment of an immigration officer\" -- an entirely open-ended premise.\n\nTrump's hardline immigration rhetoric and policy proposals during the campaign often put him at odds not only with Democrats but with many in his own party who called his proposal to build a wall on the US-Mexico border unnecessary and his calls to deport all undocumented immigrants cruel and unrealistic.\n\nTrump persevered in his hardline rhetoric throughout the campaign, resisting efforts to pivot to a more moderate stance on the issue in the general election despite calls to soften his rhetoric.\n\nNow, his actions on Wednesday took a big first step toward satisfying his political base of support that hitched to his campaign amid Trump's bold promises of building a wall, deporting undocumented immigrants and in the process creating a safer country, despite a total lack of evidence tying undocumented immigrants to higher crime rates.\n\nTrump catapulted his campaign into controversy and relevance with his announcement speech in June 2015, in which he pledged some of the hardline immigration policies he was set to enact and decried undocumented immigrants as criminals and \"rapists.\" Trump never apologized for those comments.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.71895408630371, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 579, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.00908265962, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 17, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.6994818652849695, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/10/politics/supreme-court-deliberations-on-execution-kept-quiet-ronald-smith-john-roberts/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Supreme Court deliberations on execution kept quiet", "wordcount_as_scraped": 783, "date": "20161210150000", "story_content": "Late Thursday night as briefs and orders ricocheted through the clerk's office, the Supreme Court struggled again, at the last minute, with the death penalty.\n\n \n\nTwo times an execution was temporarily delayed by Justice Clarence Thomas in order to give the justices more time to consider the case. Ultimately, the execution of Alabama inmate Ronald Smith,  was allowed to go forward\u2014by a deadlocked court.\n\n \n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who in November sided with liberal justices as a courtesy to stay the execution in a similar Alabama death row case, gave no such temporary reprieve to Smith, who was convicted of killing convenience store worker Casey Wilson in 1994. While it takes only 4 justices to agree to hear a case, it takes 5 to block an execution.\n\nThe last-minute legal drama that unfolded will remain shrouded from public view; a justice's  vote in a motion for stay of execution is rarely explained.\n\nUnlike most Supreme Court cases, which are the subject of public arguments and lengthy opinions, last-minute deliberations on death row cases are usually opaque. One law professor calls it the court's \"shadow docket.\"\n\n \n\nWhen Chief Justice John Roberts provided the so called \"courtesy vote\" last month he did something rare: he explained why.\n\n \n\n\"I do not believe that this application meets our ordinary criteria for a stay,\" Roberts wrote, before saying he would vote to delay as a courtesy and to give his four liberal colleagues more time to review the case.\n\n \n\nThe same four colleagues wanted to delay Smith's execution, but Roberts issued no explanation on why he didn't think the case warranted his courtesy vote .\n\n \n\nSmith's case highlights at least two brewing divisions on the court that won't be publicly aired in the coming days, especially since Smith was put to death at around 11 pm. \n\n \n\nFirst there is the issue of why Roberts didn't supply a courtesy vote this time around. That lack of transparency raised more questions than it answered late Thursday night.\n\n \n\n\"In these shadow docket cases, the Justices don't write opinions,\" said William Baude of the University of Chicago Law School. \"They usually don't write anything\u2014they just vote and move on.\" Baude has written extensively on the issue in the NYU Journal of Law & Liberty noting that some of the court's orders \"lack the transparency that we have come to appreciate in its merits cases.\" In the merits cases, which have justices have agreed to hear publicly, the court shows its work, dedicating pages to majority opinions and dissents. That doesn't often happen when the court is faced with an emergency application, such as a stay of execution.\n\n \n\n\"While the Court follows regular processes to produce public and reasoned opinions, its internal deliberations are afforded far more secrecy than the other two branches\" Baude wrote.\n\n \n\nRoberts most likely has very good reasons for choosing not to grant the courtesy vote, but they won't be revealed publicly.\n\n \n\nThe second is whether a judge can overrule a jury's recommendation of life without parole, as happened with Smith.\n\n The Supreme Court  struck down a similar sentencing procedure in a case out of Florida called Hurst v. Florida.   \n\nAlabama's Attorney General, Luther Strange argued that Smith's petition presented \"an unusually large number of procedural problems\" and he noted that Hurst has \"no retroactive application to Smith.\"  \n\n \n\nOne more issue involved in the case became relevant during the execution when witnesses say that Smith appeared to be struggling. According to local reports Smith\u2014who had also challenged Alabama's lethal injection protocol-- coughed and heaved for about 13 minutes.\n\n \n\nAlabama's protocol includes a drug called midazolam that has been linked -- in different doses -- to botched executions in other cases.\n\n \n\nControversy over the drugs used to kill death row inmates is not new. \"Once again a state conducted an execution that was a failed experiment,\" said Dale Baich an Assistant Federal Public Defender in Arizona, who represents prisoners in lethal injection challenges. \"As long as states continue to use midazolam as part of the lethal injection process, there will be more botched executions,\" he said noting that the issue is being litigated in Ohio.\n\n \n\nSteve Vladeck, CNN contributor and professor at the University of Texas School of Law,  says the unanswered questions provide less clarity to the litigants, the lower courts and the public. \"It complicates any effort to divine some deeper lesson from the Court's decision\u2014including whether it agrees with one side on the merits; whether some procedural obstacle prevented it from even reaching the merits; and so on.\"\n\n \n\n\"The problem is only exacerbated when the Court splits 4-4 , because although we at least know the vote, we have even less insight into the underlying reasoning,\" he said.", "metadata":

if the Hong Kong government succeeds in unseating him and three other pro-democracy lawmakers. \n\nA lawsuit was filed Friday by government lawyers seeking to disqualify Nathan Law and three others, days after a court upheld the barring of two of their colleagues. \n\n\"It's not just about my seat,\" Law told CNN. \"It's about whether those people who voted for me are willing to resist, are wiling to come out on the street and protest.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old easily won his seat during September's parliamentary election, becoming the city's youngest ever lawmaker. \n\nVeteran protester\n\nDuring the 2014 protests, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers took to the streets to campaign for free elections to choose the city's leader. \n\nWhile the Umbrella Movement succeeded in shutting down parts of the city for weeks, and attracted global attention, it failed to secure any meaningful political reforms. \n\nLaw, along with Joshua Wong and others, was one of the student leaders of the movement, even taking on government officials in a televised debate. \n\nHe and Wong went on to form the Demosisto party, to campaign for reform and self-determination for the city. \n\nThose calls have been drowned out somewhat by more radical politicians arguing for full independence from China, including Sixtus \"Baggio\" Leung and Yau Wai-ching, who were expelled from LegCo last month after a court ruled their oaths of office, in which they cursed and displayed a banner reading \"Hong Kong is not China,\" were invalid. \n\nThe ruling against them came after the dramatic intervention of Beijing, which employed a rarely-used power to re-interpret Hong Kong's Constitution and rule that oaths must be taken \"sincerely and solemnly.\"\n\nHong Kong's banned lawmakers aren't backing down\n\nSelf-determination\n\nBeijing has conflated self-determination and independence, but Law argued that the pair are distinct. \n\n\"I'm not changing what I'm upholding,\" he said. \"It is important to realize that (self-determination) is a basic right for Hong Kong people.\" \n\nHe pointed out that in 1997, when Beijing assumed power over Hong Kong from the UK, it promised the city democracy. \n\n\"It is very important to tell Hong Kong people, to tell the world that Chinese government is (a) government that they will do what they have promised,\" Law said.\n\nAsked if he was worried people would feel disillusioned at seeing the candidates they elected kicked out of office, Law said he is \"not afraid at all.\" \n\n\"(This is) an opportunity for people to show their sentiment and support for the legislators to fight back and protest on the street,\" he said. \n\nOthers were less confident. \"I'm not so sure if there will be a strong showing of people taking to the streets,\" said Jason Ng, a lawyer and author of \"Umbrellas in Bloom: Hong Kong's occupy movement uncovered.\"\n\n\"Public opinion leans very heavily against Yau and Leung, there's a danger that people lump Law and the other three with (them).\"\n\nMany people, he said, \"are simply protest-fatigued and election-fatigued.\"\n\nUS-Hong Kong factor\n\nLast month, US Senator Marco Rubio announced a bill aimed at buttressing Hong Kong autonomy in the face of Chinese encroachment. \n\nRubio, who is co-chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, said in a statement that the bill \"would renew the United States' historical commitment to freedom and democracy in Hong Kong at a time when its autonomy is increasingly under assault.\"\n\nThat announcement came after a meeting between Rubio and Wong, who said that the Cuban-American Senator had encouraged him not to retreat in the face of a communist regime. \n\nMeet with @marcorubio to discuss about Hong Kong Human

It was a powerful appeal to a nation ripped apart by the divisive 2016 campaign. Trump's election has left Democrats angry and many minorities fearful about the future.\n\nYet Trump also criticized the protests that have broken out in cities across the United States since his defeat of Hillary Clinton on Tuesday. \n\nTrump said he's seen \"a very small amount\" -- including \"one or two instances\" -- of racial slurs being directed at minorities, particularly in largely white schools, since his election. \n\n\"I would say don't do it, that's terrible, because I'm going to bring this country together,\" Trump said. \n\nRichard Cohen, President of the Southern Poverty Law Canter told CNN's \"New Day\" on Monday that there have been more that 300 incidents that their organization has recorded. \n\n\"He needs to take a little bit more responsibility for what's happening,\" Cohen said. \n\nAs for anti-Trump protests, Trump said, \"I think it's horrible if that's happening. I think it's built up by the press because, frankly, they'll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which could've been there before. If I weren't even around doing this, and they'll make into an event because that's the way the press is.\"\n\nHere are seven topics Trump addressed the interview:\n\nFBI review\n\nIn the wide-ranging interview Trump also said he's still deciding whether to ask FBI Director James Comey for his resignation. \n\nTrump demurred when asked about his plans for Comey -- whose decision to end the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server was widely panned by Republicans. \n\n\"I think that I would rather not comment on that yet,\" Trump said. \"I haven't made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. ... There's been a lot of leaking, there's no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him.\"\n\nClinton to donors: FBI letters were double whammy to campaign\n\nHe admitted he isn't sure about Comey's future. \"I'd want to see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did,\" Trump said. Comey has more than six years to go in his ten-year term.\n\nTrump also balked when asked whether he'd carry out his campaign pledge to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton. \n\nHe said Clinton \"did some bad things\" and that he's \"going to think about it\" -- but that he is more eager to focus on health care, immigration and other policy matters. \n\n\"I don't want to hurt them,\" Trump said of the Clintons, noting he'd spoken to both Hillary and Bill Clinton since his victory. \"They're good people. I don't want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do '60 Minutes' together,'\" he said. \n\nHillary Clinton has cited Comey's late-campaign season disclosures as a reason for her loss. The former secretary of state told donors in a conference call Saturday that Comey delivered a double whammy to her candidacy in the final days of the campaign by taking another look at emails related to Clinton's private server before abruptly saying he found no wrongdoing.\n\nIn the interview, Trump also discussed lobbyists' role in his transition, his distaste for the Electoral College and the future of the Trump business brand. And he waded into how abortion and gun rights would be affected by his Supreme Court nominations.\n\nSame-sex marriage and abortion\n\nTrump said he's \"fine\" with same-sex marriage remaining legal across the country, and wouldn't appoint Supreme Court judges with the goal of reversing that ruling. \n\n\"It's irrelevant because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it's done,\" Trump said. \n\nHe added: \"These cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They've been settled. And I'm -- I'm fine with that.\"\n\nTrump also pledged to appoint judges who oppose abortion rights and oppose restrictions on Second Amendment gun rights. \n\nIf Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, were overturned, Trump said, decisions on whether to legalize or ban abortion would return to states. \n\nWomen seeking abortions whose state has banned them will \"perhaps have to go -- they'll have to go to another state,\" Trump said. \n\n\"We'll see what happens. It's got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go,\" he said. \n\nDeporting undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes\n\nTrump did not repeat his campaign promise to deport all undocumented immigrants, pledging to focus first on deporting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in the United States.\n\n\"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,\" he said. \n\n\"We have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate.\"\n\nHe said he still plans to build a US-Mexico border wall. \n\n\"After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that you're talking about who are terrific people,\" he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said Sunday that despite Trump's campaign rhetoric, lawmakers were not about to form a deportation force to round-up and deport undocumented immigrants. The focus was on securing the border instead, he told CNN.\n\nRyan: 'We are not planning on erecting a deportation force'\n\nDraining the swamp\n\nTrump's rallying cry on the campaign trail was that he'd \"drain the swamp\" in Washington. But so far, Trump's transition team is filled with the usual suspects -- lobbyists and longtime Washington hands. \n\nTrump didn't chafe at that characterization of his transition team. \"Everybody's a lobbyist down there,\" he said, referring to Washington. \n\n\"That's the problem with the system -- the system. Right now, we're going to clean it up. We're having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we're going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren't happy about, but we're putting on term limits. We're doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist,\" Trump said. \n\nHe said relying on those lobbyists now while planning to eliminate them later is no contradiction. \n\n\"I'm saying that they know the system right now, but we're going to phase that out. You have to phase it out,\" Trump said. \n\nFighting ISIS\n\nTrump stuck by his often-mocked claim that he knows more than American generals about fighting ISIS -- despite having no experience in government, the military or elected office before winning Tuesday's presidential contest. \n\nAsked if he still feels he knows more, Trump said: \"I'll be honest with you, I probably do because look at the job they've done. OK, look at the job they've done. They haven't done the job. \n\n\"Now, maybe it's leadership, maybe it's something else. Who knows? All I can tell you is we're going to get rid of ISIS.\"\n\nIraqi forces retake ancient Assyrian village of Nimrud from ISIS\n\nDitching the Electoral College\n\nTrump won more electoral votes than Clinton -- but he didn't win the popular vote. \n\nStill, he says, he favors ditching the Electoral College and handing the presidency to the winner of the popular vote. \n\n\"I'm not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. you know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There's a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play,\" Trump said. \n\nOn the Trump brand\n\nTrump and his children both said they're not sweating any negative impact on their family's businesses resulting from a long and contentious campaign -- or from backlash to the President-elect. \n\n\"I don't think it matters. This is so much more important, and more serious,\" Ivanka Trump said. \n\nHer father added, \"I think what Ivanka's trying to say, 'Who cares? Who cares?' This is big league stuff. ... We're going to save our country. I don't care about hotel occupancy. It's peanuts compared to what we're doing.\" \n\nTrump isn't putting his family's business in a blind trust -- leaving it to his children instead -- but does plan to turn down the salary typically paid to presidents. \n\n\"I've never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I'll take $1 a year. But it's a -- I don't even know what it is,\" Trump said, before turning to Stahl and asking, \"Do you know what the salary is?\" \n\nWhen Stahl told Trump it is $400,000 per year, he said, \"No, I'm not going to take the salary. I'm not taking it.\"\n\nTrump also signaled he has no real plans to change his tone -- even though it's seen by many as evidence of a man too combustible for the presidency. \n\n\"Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated,\" Trump said. \"I don't want to be just a little nice monotone character, and in many cases I will be.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.56918692588806, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1223, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.7059774665700003, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114010000, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 8, "pct_mft_words": 3.0253475061324604, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/opinions/past-still-matters-bernstein-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "How to use the past to fight for your rights today", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1186, "date": "20170123200000", "story_content": "This weekend, I traveled from Chicago to Washington for the Women's March. Surrounded by hundreds of thousands of women and men, young and old, black and white, in wheelchairs and walking, I was inspired to see how many of us feel the need right now to stand up for our own rights and for those of our fellow Americans from every background. From the plane from Chicago to DC (filled with pink hats), to Metro lines snaking around the corner, to being jam packed on the National Mall, the march and its scope uplifted me for the first time in over two months as I realized how many of my fellow Americans believe we must act as citizens to protect our rights.\n\nSome argue that such a protest is partisan and unfair, since Donald Trump has just taken office. But there is plenty of evidence to suggest the marchers are right to be concerned. This month, Human Rights Watch issued a report that, for the first time in its twenty-seven year history, listed the United States as one of the biggest human rights threats because of the election of Donald Trump. Human Rights Watch published its report in the same week that Congress vetted Jeff Sessions as Attorney General in the face of historic opposition from civil rights groups like the NAACP and ACLU. \n\nAs a historian, I'm in a unique position to spotlight threats -- past and present -- to our civil liberties. The march, the inauguration, and the Human Rights Watch report coincide with the thirtieth anniversary this month of the U.S. House of Representatives' introduction of legislation that became the 1988 Civil Liberties Act, Congress's apology on behalf of the nation for the World War II imprisonment of more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent. And that provides an important opportunity to pause and reflect. On January 6, 1987, Congressman Tom Foley of Washington introduced legislation that would acknowledge the internment of citizens and foreigners alike under the guise of military necessity as a mistake, a \"grave injustice\" fueled by racism. In its final form, the bill signed into law by President Ronald Reagan stated, \"The internment of the individuals of Japanese ancestry was caused by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.\"\n\nOur present shows us that we can't afford to forget the past. The Southern Poverty Law Center continues to report the occurrence of significant spikes in hate crimes apparently spurred by the election. Notably, some of the President-elect's advisors have justified suggestions for a Muslim registry by citing Japanese-American imprisonment during World War II as a credible precedent.\n\nAlong with two colleagues, I recently organized a statement of principle, now signed by almost 1,800 scholars of U.S. history and related fields with a variety of political orientations, including at least six Pulitzer Prize winners, a MacArthur \"Genius\" award recipient, five Bancroft Prize winners, twelve Guggenheim Fellows, and many other highly distinguished and eminent scholars from across the country and internationally. It suggests we must use historical knowledge \u2014 like the content of the 1988 Civil Liberties Act and its acknowledgment of our nation's past missteps \u2014 as part of what we call \"informed citizenship.\" Looking back to history provides copious lessons on what is at stake when we allow hysteria and untruths to trample people's rights. A key lesson has been to never again repeat these mistakes, and so we issue a call to recognize and act upon the critical links between historical knowledge, informed citizenship, and the protection of civil and human rights.\n\nTo be sure, some suggest that historians should remain impartial, and that by issuing a collective statement we are being partisan or merely reflecting the so-called \"liberal bias\" of academia. But this is neither a partisan issue nor a liberal issue. It is an American issue.\n\nInformed citizenry is essential to democracy, as the creators of the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 recognized when they enshrined in the document the words \"Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among the body of the people\" are \"necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties.\" The burden of ensuring our democracy is just lies with the citizens, and I urge my fellow Americans to become informed and help sustain our democracy by, for example, paying attention to history and current politics, committing to get the facts right, and voicing concerns about violations of civil rights and liberties (and other dangers to democracy) to elected officials.\n\nIn our statement we highlight other historical persecutions, events that show how easily the rights of people have been suspended during times of great uncertainty, and reveal how critical \"informed citizenship\" is to the preservation of American democratic ideals.\n\nAlong with internment, we point to the \"witch hunts\" of the early Cold War era, when House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigations of communists and their sympathizers destroyed the lives of countless teachers, artists, politicians, writers, and others. The witch hunts associated with Joseph McCarthy were roundly denounced by Republicans and Democrats during the 1954 Army-McCarthy Senate hearings. \n\nDecades of research, debate, and analysis have brought historians to a consensus that episodes like internment and McCarthyism were misguided and immoral.\n\nThe nuanced political history of both internment and McCarthyism demonstrate that both major parties have stood at times on the right side of history and also at times have violated democratic ideals. Republicans and Democrats joined in the 1954 Army-McCarthy Senate hearings in denouncing the Republican McCarthy, as they did in supporting the 1988 Civil Liberties Act. Ronald Reagan, a hero of the Republican Party, signed the 1988 Act. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, one of the Democrats' most revered figures, signed the order for internment. The very same Earl Warren who became liberals' hero when he led his colleagues as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court in decisions like the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education originally helped orchestrate internment as California's World War II-era Attorney General.  \n\nOther scholars and I now join the Republican and Democratic politicians who denounced such policies in earlier eras, as well as the millions of marchers standing up for the rights of all Americans, and repudiate in the strongest possible terms any future policies that foster a return to the (unconstitutional) intolerance and inhumanity of these past episodes.\n\nIt is deeply disturbing to find ourselves at a historical moment where misguided appeals to hate and fear seem to be regaining traction. Our president boldly disregards factual information, and his spokesperson Kellyanne Conway suggests that \"alternative facts\" are just as real as actual facts, and in the process dismisses the historical lessons that may be drawn when politicians replace fact with exaggeration \u2014 or worse, outright fiction.\n\nI take comfort from and add my voice to those who have recently reminded us as a society to relearn the lessons of history and apply its tools of critical thinking to our current moment. I implore my fellow Americans \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Green Party, and Independents \u2014 to become informed citizens, to read history with critical and appreciative minds, and to be prepared to fight any attempts to undermine our democracy.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.5039124488830597, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1154, "FairnessVirtue": 18, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.050749560830001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 60, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123200000, "FairnessVice": 3, "pct_mft_words": 5.19930675909879, "mft_mean": 5.454545454550001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/14/africa/mmm-ponzi-scheme-nigeria/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1325, "scraper_regex": 1471}}, "headline": "The meteoric rise of one of the world's largest Ponzi schemes in Nigeria", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1471, "date": "20161214180000", "story_content": "In spite of the government's warnings against it, many Nigerians continue to invest in Mavrodi Mundial Movement (MMM), a Russian company that was responsible for one of the world's largest Ponzi schemes of all time.\n\nOn 13 December, the company said it was 'freezing' all confirmed accounts. While many that are opposed to the scheme believe the suspension may be an indication of an imminent collapse, MMM Nigeria assured its members it was only freezing the system for a period of one month.\n\n\"The reason for this measure is evident. We need to prevent problems during the New Year season, and then, when everything calms down, this measure will be canceled,\" the administrator said in a message sent to all members.\n\nIn spite of the indication that things may not be in order with MMM, Ifeanyi Okoro and some other members remain confident in the scheme.\n\nConfidence remains\n\n\"Even with this minor setback, I still strongly have confidence in MMM. The government and the press will amplify this but we all know that MMM is not going anywhere,\" Okoro said.  \n\nJoe Sanya revealed that he had already invested NGN1 million in the scheme. While expressing confidence in MMM, he warned that the only thing that could harm the system is the fear the news would instill fear in MMM's prospective members and confirmed account holders.\n\n\"The abrupt action of MMM has brought lot of fears and panic already which could even in itself crash the system. Guiders will have to come up with a plan to put the mind of Nigerians at ease. I don't know how they will do that but it has to be done. We need a constructive counter move from MMM against the enormous negativity going on via social media right now or else my one million naira and those of my friends will be gone.\"\n\nMichael Mbah, an MMM Nigeria top guider, added: \"This is a temporary measure to save the system and saving the system is saving our money. Our money is safe. By January, the system will be back and it will be stronger.\" \n\nHow did MMM successfully convince many Nigerians to look away from the facts, warnings and experiences elsewhere? The key is understanding how MMM works. \n\n'Like a charity'\n\nA member is required to make payments directly into the bank account of another member. When this is successfully done, the payer is qualified to receive three times what he or she paid from someone else.\n\n The scheme was launched in November 2015 in Nigeria but it got popular in 2016 and its philosophy is to financially empower its members who are committed to helping one another. New members are often recruited into the scheme by the promise of 30% monthly return on their investment and higher returns when they offer to assist members that ask for financial assistance.\n\nWhen Chibuzor Chukwuemeka, a young Nigerian professional first heard of the scheme from a friend, he said he thought it was a scam. But since he joined about four months ago, he has had no regrets.\n\n\"I will tell you that MMM has empowered me financially,\" he told CNN.\n\nIsaiah Olasope, a university lecturer, said he joined the scheme with NGN50,000 (about $158) and was able to make a profit of NGN60,000 (about $190) within two months. He noted that the best approach to succeeding is via referrals and paying as soon as possible.\n\n\"I would have continued, but I stopped after I made more than what I put into it,\" he said.\n\nThe scheme is especially popular among new graduates and the unemployed, and even entrepreneurs like Lydia Aborishade, who said she was able to get a tangible return.\n\n\"It's like a charity organization where you provide and get help. If you help someone, you get twice what you give,\" she said.\n\nThe government: 'It's fraudulent'\n\nThe scheme markets itself as a charity, which is why it celebrated its first anniversary with a Humanitarian week held from Nov 13th -- 19th 2016 by donating relief materials worth NGN5 million to two internally displaced persons' camps in Nigeria's capital city of Abuja.\n\nBut the Nigerian government has been unequivocal in discouraging citizens from participating. Through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), it urged citizens not to get involved in MMM, calling it fraudulent.\n\n\"We've heard about the activities of MMM, but I want to warn you against it because they are wonder banks that are not regulated. Desist from participating, because they are fraudulent,\" said Hajiya Kadija Kassim, \u200ehead, Consumer Protection Department of the CBN.\n\nCBN also unsuccessfully attempted to stop financial transactions related to MMM and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria (SEC) warned investors about the scheme.\n\nTaking it further, Nigeria's parliament directed security operatives to arrest MMM promoters, but in spite of these efforts, Nigeria has yet to officially criminalize MMM. \n\nA spokesman for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Wilson Uwujaren, said they are monitoring the scheme.\n\nMMM Founder, Sergey Mavrodi, in his open letter to the Nigerian government confirmed that the number of MMM members in Nigeria is 3 million. He also said: \"MMM produces nothing, but nothing gets out of the country either. The money is just redistributed among the citizens of Nigeria. It gets from those who are richer to poorer ones, in this way restoring social justice. What's wrong with that?\"\n\nThe government's position is unsurprising to MMM participants: they claim CBN wants people to keep money in the banks which will in turn be used to further enrich the country's wealthiest.\n\n\"The CBN we know has not in recent times made people-oriented policies, most of their policies favor the rich and that is what MMM has come to do -- reduce the gap between the rich and the poor,\" Chukwuemeka said.\n\nOlasope added that the government is against the scheme because few people still save money in banks.\n\n\"I don't think any bank will pay you interest of up to 5% in a month when you keep money with them, but MMM pays 30%. CBN officials know that MMM will make Nigerians to stop taking money to banks so their best approach is to make it illegal,\" he said. \n\nPastors for MMM?\n\nThe MMM conversation has been extended to churches, where the official position varies from one place of worship to another.\n\nAt the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), the country's largest Pentecostal church, some pastors are allowing MMM promoters to pitch the scheme to members from the pulpit. While others are against it, many are at crossroads.\n\nPastor Agbede Mayowa, who heads a branch of the church in Lagos, said MMM is a real dilemma for clergymen. Instead of having a position in the scheme, he said he is promoting an open conversation on the subject among members of the congregation.\n\n\"I have been inundated with messages and calls on MMM. 'Pastor, is it a sin? Should a Christian be involved?' Personally, I don't think it's a sin even though I have my reservations. Most people however think otherwise,\" he said.\n\nIbadan-based economist, Lekan Adigun said the wide acceptance of MMM in Nigeria in spite of numerous failures of similar schemes is not in line with industry edicts; it preys on the economic recession and citizens' desire for quick wealth.\n\n\"According to the Alexa ranking, MMM's is the fifth most visited website in Nigeria, more popular than Facebook. It has also shown that Nigeria isn't really a mobile first nation and getting the support of the government is overrated,\" Adigun said. \n\n\"I think techies should leverage this MMM craze to promote online payment adoption.

Its tiled roof rises above the surrounding flat, canal-riven fields.\n\nThere has been a church here for close to 500 years. For the last five years, it's been Prosman's home.\n\nOn an average Sunday, he says, about a third of the 800 villagers will come to attend his service. \n\nHe has got to know many of them well over the past few years and in that time has witnessed the growing popularity of Holland's Donald Trump: the peroxide-blonde populist Geert Wilders.\n\nProsman tells me that he doesn't consider himself a prototypical nationalist, but he increasingly finds himself echoing the concerns of his rural parishioners. \n\nThe village looks and feels typically Dutch. Ducks splash around in the water; a few feet away, villagers amble between shops and stop to chat with friends. \n\nIt's a stone's throw from Amsterdam, but Nieuwkoop feels a world away from the bustle and tourists.\n\nProsman grew up around here. His father was a church minister before him. His grandfather was a local reed salesman in this region, famed for its peat and bull rushes. \n\nAt one time, both were staples of local commerce, but over the past few decades, Nieuwkoop, Prosman says, has become typical of many similar villages: they've become Holland's rural rust belt.\n\nPeat and rushes are no longer in the same demand and employment patterns have changed, leaving many of Prosman's congregation uncertain about the future.\n\nThey are worried about the economy, he says, about the welfare system and about healthcare, but most of all about rising crime -- something many of them blame on Muslim immigrants.\n\nProsman's plain but welcoming 19th-century church replaced an even older one built in the 1500s. In an era of uncertainty, it has become a reassuring beacon of continuity and identity.\n\nIn Holland today, Prosman explains, the major political parties are hemorrhaging followers. \n\nThere is a crisis of confidence in the European Union's old elites. The integration and open borders that they sold supporters are past their expiry date. \n\n\"I think people get it. And they don't want it,\" Prosman says of the EU.\n\nProsman, who is not only a minister but also writes books on political science, says that his religious calling puts him far closer to the people than regular politicians. \n\nHis congregation confide in him, he says, in a way they wouldn't with others.\n\nMainstream political parties are out of touch, leaving many of his congregation turning to populist Geert Wilders for guidance and answers.\n\nAnti-establishment tsunami sweeps Europe\n\nHe tells me that Wilders' appeal mirrors the rise of Donald Trump: \"I think it's the same in Holland with Geert Wilders: his voters take him seriously not literally,\" he says, whereas politicians \"tend to take him literally.\"\n\nLike Trump, Wilders' popularity is rising\n\nOne of Wilders' hot button issues is Muslim immigration: even in tiny rural Nieuwkoop, Prosman says it resonates. \n\nHe claims that public housing is being given to immigrants and that it is \"very hard for young [Dutch] people to find a house.\"\n\nIn the 2006 general elections, Wilders' PVV (Party For Freedom) won 5.9% of the vote. In 2012, it won a little over 10.1%. Ahead of national elections here March 2017, polls predict that the party may get about 20% of the vote, making it the largest party in Parliament.\n\nWhere Trump has said many Mexicans are criminals, Wilders blames Muslim migrants -- in particular Moroccans -- who make up barely 2.2% of Holland's population.\n\nHe's been to court more than once on hate speech charges.\n\nLast week, Wilders was convicted of inciting discrimination and \"insulting a group\" after a trial over statements he made about Moroccans.  \n\nBut the court found him not guilty of incitement to hatred and handed down no punishment.\n\nBut why do people back Wilders?\n\nNot far from Nieuwkoop, Financial Administrator Cindy van Kruistum is a fervent supporter of Wilders.\n\nWe meet in her smart, middle-class house, where her daughter's running watch is charging on a white table in her pristine kitchen. \n\nIf she wasn't meeting with me, she says she'd be out playing tennis.\n\nThe occasional car passes by on the quiet tree-lined road outside her large living room window; more frequently, her neighbors cycle past on the broad bike path. \n\nIt seems like the Dutch idyll so many of us imagine.\n\nYet Cindy tells me that on a street close by, her friend's son was mugged by a Muslim migrant.\n\nIt's not an isolated case, she warns. She follows a TV program that documents many such attacks. Wilders has the only answer, she says.\n\n\"I support him because he dares to talk about the problems we have with Islamization ... if they don't want to integrate, they should leave\", she says, quoting Wilders' campaign rhetoric.\n\nI ask if she is racist. \n\nQuite definitely not, she replies: \"My youngest daughter has a friend from Morocco ... and he fits in very well.\"\n\nWilders, she says, is the only politician who is in touch with the people. He understands what's happening.\n\nShe says: \"The government, the establishment, they don't listen to the people. They don't go on the streets. Geert Wilders, he is near the people on the streets.\"\n\nIt feels as if we are far further from Amsterdam and its liberal trappings of dope-selling coffee shops and in-your-face red light districts than the hour drive away it actually is. But as Cindy explains, what the Dutch really treasure as their culture is under threat.\n\n\"The values we have in our country and the traditions we have in our country, they don't give a damn about it,\" she says, in reference to Muslim immigrants.\n\n\"The next thing you know they'll want to ban gays walking hand in hand in the street -- and that sort of freedom is important to us.\"\n\nCindy is not the only one to give me precisely that example of tolerance under threat. \n\nComedy writer Haye van Heyden told me the same thing.\n\nHis reasons for supporting Wilders are different from Cindy's, although like her he is frustrated with mainstream politicians.\n\nHe tells me he was ostracized by friends and lost work after he wrote an article explaining his support for Wilders.\n\n\"It's undemocratic\", he says.\n\nIndeed, punishing those who express their views is part of what angers him about Holland's traditional politicians. He says they refuse to deal with Wilders, instead accusing him of being racist.\n\nI ask him if supporting Wilders makes him a racist. Like Cindy, he says absolutely not. \n\n\"I'm not a racist. I am very sure of it but I feel I have to protect the people who have their doubts about Islam.\"\n\nHe tells me he doesn't like everything Wilders says, but that he wants to stand up for the rights of all those who do believe him. \"I'm voting for Mr Wilders. It's a protest vote because of the exclusion of him and his followers.\"\n\nMinister Prosman echoes van Haye's sentiment: not everyone following Wilders is a nationalist, but they have given up on mainstream politics.\n\n\"It's a wake up call for politicians,\" he explains. \"No one votes for Wilders out of principle, but they want to make sure they are heard.\"\n\nIt is perhaps no surprise that Prosman has become a natural confidant of his congregation.\n\nHis church is an epicenter of calm continuity amidst a world of change outside.\n\nMainstream politicians might do well to stop by once in a while.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.58227849006653, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1144, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.64140637139, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 6, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161214080000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.0979020979021, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/28/health/age-youth-treatment-medication/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1580, "scraper_regex": 1736}}, "headline": "The risks of anti-aging medicine", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1736, "date": "20161214200000", "story_content": "Hanneke Hops wasn't afraid of dying. What concerned her was growing old and not being able to run marathons, ride horses, or fly planes. So the 56-year-old Hayward, California, woman turned to Alan Mintz, M.D. -- a radiologist who founded the Cenegenics Medical Institute in Las Vegas, which specializes in \"age management medicine.\"\n\nShe was prescribed recombinant human growth hormone (HGH), a synthetic version of a pituitary hormone hawked as a miraculous fountain of youth. Though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that taking HGH poses serious health risks, Hops -- unaware there was any harm -- began injecting it into her thigh six times a week.\n\nShe never did grow old. Six months later, in 2004, she was dead, her liver full of malignant tumors. While it is impossible to prove that HGH therapy contributed to Hops's death, the use of HGH has been linked to an increased risk of cancer. (Mintz said at the time of Hops's death that Hops would not have been treated if he knew she had cancer.)\n\nToday, thousands of physicians are catering to the 78 million baby boomers who are hoping to feel younger, longer -- and willing to pay for the privilege. The anti-aging industry is expected to gross more than $291 billion worldwide by 2015.\n\nHealth.com: Anti-aging doctors to avoid\n\nThe problem is, many of these so-called anti-aging doctors are making empty promises. \"They're one step above snake oil salesmen,\" says Steven R. Goldstein, M.D., a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at New York University School of Medicine. They prey on women who have legitimate medical concerns such as poor sleep, flagging energy, and libido loss, he says, yet they often lack the training required to treat those problems.\n\nEven worse, they peddle therapies -- most notably, the unapproved use of hormones like HGH and customized drug cocktails -- which are unproven and can even be deadly.\n\nThe rise of the anti-aging doc\n\nOnce, middle-aged women sought out a gynecologist for menopausal symptoms, or an internist for fatigue. Now a new brand of doctor is promising to treat the above, and deliver much more: better sex, a fitter body, dewier skin.\n\n\"They often try to convince people that aging is their fault: 'If you listen to us, we can fix the problem,' \" says S. Jay Olshansky, Ph.D., a research associate at the Center on Aging at the University of Chicago.\n\nHealth.com: Why sex is better after 50\n\nYet aging is a natural process, not a medical condition, and there isn't any therapy that can reverse it or slow it down, Olshansky says. Official medical associations from the Endocrine Society to the American Medical Association warn against using \"anti-aging\" interventions.\n\nAnd while traditional doctors, such as endocrinologists (who specialize in hormones) and geriatricians (who focus on the elderly) are specifically trained to treat age-related conditions such as hormone imbalances, \"not all anti-aging doctors have a degree or advanced expertise\" in what they practice, Olshansky says.\n\nIn fact, anti-aging isn't a specialty that's recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties, meaning doctors can't officially be board-certified in it. Yet it has its own professional society, the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M). Founded in 1992, A4M boasts some 24,000 members worldwide and offers a certificate in anti-aging medicine, available to any M.D.\n\nHealth.com: Erase 10 years from head to toe\n\nOnce a doctor sets up an anti-aging practice, she stands to make major profits. Many age-fighting treatments aren't covered by insurance, which means the M.D.s prescribing them are paid out-of-pocket, Olshansky says -- and that can add up to thousands per patient. At a time when physicians are getting lower and lower reimbursements under managed care, it's little wonder that doctors of all stripes, from emergency-room medicine to radiology, are flocking to this lucrative new specialty.\n\nUnproven treatments\n\nSo how do you know if your doctor is making promises he can't keep? Here are the top dangers Health's investigation uncovered:\n\n\u2022 Risky hormone therapies. The biggest weapon in the anti-aging doctor's arsenal is the willy-nilly prescribing of hormones. \"The concept is that if you take a 60-year-old woman and duplicate the hormone environment from when she was 20, she'll feel like she's 20,\" says Nanette Santoro, M.D., director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. \"It is essentially the idea of drinking the blood of young children.\"\n\nIt's also hazardous, because most age-erasing doctors aren't trained in using these powerful substances. \"In this entire field, I've only encountered one board-certified endocrinologist,\" says Thomas Perls, M.D., an associate professor of medicine and geriatrics at Boston University School of Medicine. \"It's outrageous that people think they can prescribe these toxic hormone soups.\" \n\nThe main ingredient in that soup is HGH, which naturally declines in our bodies as we age. Anti-aging doctors claim that by boosting HGH levels with injections that can cost $12,000 or more per year, you can reduce body fat, build muscle, improve sexual function, and up your energy.\n\nHealth.com: 5 secrets to boost your energy\n\nBut \"there is no scientific proof of this,\" Perls says. \"And studies show that increasing HGH levels with drugs predisposes people to heart disease, diabetes, and cancer\" -- suggesting that the hormone may have been a contributing factor in Hanneke Hops's death.\n\nIn fact, HGH is only FDA-approved for use in a handful of conditions in adults (including adult growth hormone deficiency, which is rare), and it is illegal to distribute a product containing HGH for anti-aging purposes.\n\nAnother hot hormone is bioidentical estrogen. For decades, women have relied on synthetic estrogen to relieve menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. But when the Women's Health Initiative study on estrogen and progestin therapy was halted in 2002 -- due to a possible hormone-related increase in the risk of heart disease, stroke, blood clots, and breast cancer -- some doctors touted bioidentical versions, made from soy and yams, as safer (though there's no proof they're less likely to raise your disease risk).\n\nBioidentical creams and pills made by pharmaceutical companies are available via prescription and regulated by the FDA. Still, many anti-aging docs attempt to create their own bioidentical hormone cocktails tailored to their patients' special needs.\n\nHealth.com: Can supplements ease menopause symptoms?\n\nIt's this customization that is most troubling to mainstream doctors. It involves taking a prescription to a compounding pharmacy, where pharmacists mix ingredients as outlined by your physician -- and the resulting concoctions are not approved by the FDA. \"When the FDA looked at compounded medicines, 43 percent of them didn't have the things that they were supposed to,\" Goldstein says. That means the drug you're getting may not work -- or may have unpredictable side effects.\n\nWhether there's even such a thing as an optimal hormone level is unclear, notes Cynthia Pearson, executive director of the National Women's Health Network, a nonprofit group that advocates for women's health issues: \"Women can have very different symptoms at the same hormone levels.\"\n\n\u2022 Fad diagnoses. One of the newer anti-aging buzz phrases is adrenal fatigue. The theory behind the syndrome is that chronic stress causes a decrease in the production of adrenal hormones, which can cause fatigue and sleep issues.\n\nBut while there is a legitimate condition called adrenal insufficiency, which is diagnosed by an endocrinologist using a battery of tests, \"adrenal fatigue is a bogus diagnosis,\" Perls says. What's more, the standard treatment -- hydrocortisone -- can lead to osteoporosis, diabetes, and organ dysfunction, says Jeffrey I. Mechanick, M.D., clinical professor of medicine, endocrinology, diabetes, and bone disease at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.\n\nHealth.com: 11 foods for healthy bones\n\nHeavy-metal toxicity is another trendy diagnosis. The concept: Removing the body's lifetime build-up of mercury, lead, and other metals can prevent or reverse age-related conditions such as heart disease. This is often attempted through chelation therapy, in which a synthesized amino acid called EDTA is run into patients' bloodstreams; the EDTA attaches to the metals, which are then flushed out of the body with urine. The process can take 20 to 40 two- to four-hour treatments, at a cost of at least $2,500.\n\nBut while chelation therapy may benefit those with heavy-metal poisoning (a rare problem), there's zero evidence it helps the rest of us. \"It's quackery at its best,\" Perls says. \"People have died from it.\" Case in point: In 2003, a 53-year-old Oregon woman died during her fourth round of chelation therapy. According to the medical examiner, the cause was a cardiac arrhythmia stemming from the EDTA infusion.\n\n\u2022 Pill-a-palooza. Forget popping a simple multi-vitamin from the drugstore. \"Many anti-aging doctors sell their own lines of nutraceuticals at very high prices,\" Perls says. \"It's a profit margin that's better than what cocaine dealers get.\"\n\nDon't waste your money, says Olshansky: \"The vast majority of studies say anti-aging supplements don't work.\" Plus, they're not required to be FDA-approved before they're sold, so there's no guarantee that they're safe or effective. \"We don't know if they could help, but they could be harmful,\" says Winifred K. Rossi, deputy director of the Division of Geriatrics and Gerontology at the National Institute on Aging.\n\nHealth.com: Mistakes women make in middle age\n\nAge well -- and wisely\n\nThe good news is, no one is saying that you have to just deal with hot flashes, weight gain, or any other midlife change. Fifty-plus women may not have the biology of twentysomethings, but they can still feel vibrant, healthy, and even sexy.\n\n\"Our best advice is not very different from what our mothers told us: Maintain a healthy weight, be active, eat nutritious food, and don't smoke,\" Rossi says. Two key nutrients also help: calcium (get 1,200 milligrams a day, preferably from food; 1 cup of yogurt has 415 milligrams) and vitamin D (aim for 2,000 IU daily in a supplement, since it's tough to get otherwise), Goldstein says.\n\nThen, make sure you have the right medical team in place. Most women use their OB/GYNs as their go-to, but in your 40s, consider seeing a family-practice doctor or internist, too, says Pearson: \"They're qualified to handle all the routine issues that come up as women hit middle age.\"\n\nThis back-to-basics approach may not sound as cutting-edge as special injections or souped-up supplements, but it's time-tested and a lot less costly -- for your wallet and your health. \"Many of the benefits that are associated with HGH -- you can get those with exercise, for free,\" says Olshansky. \"You don't have to spend $12,000.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.71468138694763, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1580, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.99171839093, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 6, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.2658227848101298, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/28/health/drug-use-early-death/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1060, "scraper_regex": 1163}}, "headline": "How drugs can contribute to an early death", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1163, "date": "20161228230000", "story_content": "Can drug use contribute to a person's earlier-than-expected death, even if they stopped using long ago? Undoubtedly, yes. \n\nAlthough each drug causes unique physiological and neurological effects, all drugs overlap in one important way, said Dr. Scott Krakower, assistant unit chief for psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital, New Hyde Park in New York. All drugs cause changes in the brain, some in ways that may be long-lasting or even permanent. \n\nThese brain changes can have significant effects on mood and cause depression, ultimately lessening a person's ability to lead their best and healthiest life.\n\nOr, as the website of the National Institute on Drug Abuse describes: Once addicted, the brain is literally changed.\n\nYour brain regulates all the body's basic functions, including every breath and each heartbeat, while enabling you to interpret and respond to experience. It shapes thoughts and emotions and determines your behavior. \n\nDespite some commonality, the short- and long-term health effects of drugs are distinct, with each one potentially affecting life spans in a different way. \n\nOpioids\n\nOpioids include heroin and prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, morphine and fentanyl. All members of the same chemical family, these drugs interact with the opioid receptors on nerve cells in both the body and the brain. \n\nThough opioids bring a reduction in pain, these drugs also cause changes in your blood pressure, in terms of lowering it acutely, and can bring changes in heart rhythm.\n\nAn opioid user's blood pressure can drop suddenly and significantly, \"and that can lead to a stroke,\" said Dr. Robin Dharia, a vascular neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. She added that opiates affect breathing and oxygenation of blood. With overdoses, users have difficulty breathing, which can be deadly.\n\nIn the long term, \"opiates can have a lot of effects on the body. Most commonly, we think of problems with bowel function,\" Dharia said. Nausea and vomiting are common among users, while some have trouble going to the bathroom. If this constipation becomes severe enough, it can lead to an intestinal rupture, she said.\n\n\"Opiates can also cause problems with the endocrine system -- your hormone system,\" Dharia said, which can lead to problems with sexual function, fertility and reduced testosterone levels in men. Bone disorders may also be a result of chronic use.\n\n\"Chronic use can cause slowing of the electrical activity in the brain,\" Dharia said, explaining that because opiates depress the central nervous system, they can cause sleep-wake cycle changes, mood changes, cognitive issues and even cognitive decline.\n\n\"We see seizures after abrupt changes in opiate use,\" Dharia said. \n\nCocaine\n\nPhysiologically, cocaine reduces blood flow in the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to tears and ulcerations. Chronic cocaine users often lose their appetite and may become malnourished. Cocaine also has well-recognized negative effects on the heart and cardiovascular system. \n\nThis drug can \"damage and destroy the walls of the heart,\" Dharia said, and it can affect the coronary arteries. \"Even in young people without the typical risk factors, it can narrow the arteries in the heart,\" she added.\n\nChest pains resembling a heart attack send many users to the ER. Meanwhile, long-term medical consequences include cardiac conditions, such as deterioration of the heart's ability to contract, and aortic ruptures as well as neurological impairment, said Krakower. \n\nBleeding in the brain and bulges in the walls of blood vessels in the brain also accompany long-term cocaine use. \n\n\"You can get a stroke after your first try or years of use,\" Dharia said, adding that cocaine causes \"quite a bit of damage to the arteries in the brain,\" which sometimes causes seizures.\n\nMovement disorders, including Parkinson's disease, may also occur after many years of use. Meanwhile, in the brain, the reward pathway becomes less sensitive, while brain circuits involved in stress become increasingly sensitive.\n\n\"Because you have this dramatic change in dopamine, you might not be able to feel ... sensation or pleasure,\" Krakower said. \"Long-term effects from cocaine include interference within the glutamate system and prefrontal cortex.\" \n\nThe result of these brain changes means regular cocaine users are more likely to want, seek and use the drug instead of focusing on relationships, food or other natural rewards.\n\n\"The idea is, you can get this lack of motivation and sort of blah feeling and not have the same, let's say, reaction to things -- even libido,\" Krakower said.\n\nCocaine worsens memory, according to Krakower. In addition, studies suggest that long-term cocaine use harms a range of cognitive functions, including making decisions, performing motor tasks, sustaining attention and inhibiting impulses. \n\nMarijuana and hallucinogens\n\nMarijuana is the \"most commonly used illicit drug in the United States,\" the National Institute on Drug Abuse says. Weed produces euphoria, yet it also impairs the judgment of users, motor coordination and reaction times. Short-term, cannabis increases the heart rate, even doubling it in some cases. Sudden rapid beating poses a cardiac danger to anyone with a pre-existing heart condition.\n\nMarijuana contains toxic gases and particles that can harm the lungs. Routine smoking is linked to airway inflammation and increased symptoms of chronic bronchitis. Regular users have a greater likelihood of respiratory infections, including pneumonia.\n\nA few studies have shown that marijuana use in the teen years is associated with an increased risk for an aggressive form of testicular cancer. National Institute on Drug Abuse researchers say early onset of this cancer indicates that just a few years of use may be harmful.\n\nDifferent still are hallucinogens, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), or acid; mescaline and peyote; psilocybin, or \"magic mushrooms\"; and phencyclidine (PCP), or angel dust. \n\nGenerally, hallucinogens distort a user's perception of reality, direction, distance and time. Some have effects lasting up to 12 hours. Disoriented, users can become unpredictable, erratic and violent, which can lead to serious injury or even death. \n\nWith LSD, in particular, repeat users develop a tolerance, so they tend to take higher and higher doses to achieve the same psychedelic effects.

By Obama's own admission, the major pieces of his presidential legacy are now subject to a gutting by a successor he resents deeply.\n\nBut the President insisted to his supporters and Democrats Wednesday this is not the end.\n\n\"The sun is up, and I know everybody had a long night. I did as well,\" Obama said in the White House Rose Garden. \n\nObama will likely leave office with an approval rating of over 50%, and it's a truism of American politics that ex-presidents get more popular after they leave the White House.\n\nNothing, however, can paper over the fact that the first African-American president will stand on the inaugural platform next to Donald Trump, who stoked divisions and preyed on people's racist fears, including through lies and insinuations about Obama himself. \n\nObama's efforts on Hillary Clinton's behalf over the past month, unprecedented for a modern sitting president, reflected not only a desire to elect his former secretary of state. It was a chance to sell, again, his vision of a hopeful America and the progress inherent in a nation ready to elect its first African-American president. \n\nThe US electorate affirmed that vision in 2008, and gave Obama more time to fulfill it in 2012. But voters now leave Obama with little hope of salvaging a presidential legacy that depended heavily on his successor. \n\nTrump and Obama will meet Thursday, and the President said the White House will cooperate with the incoming administration, citing the example President George W. Bush set in 2008. \n\n\"Everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that we're actually all on one team,\" Obama said. \"This is an intramural scrimmage. We're not Democrats first. We're not Republicans first. We are Americans first. We're patriots first. We all want what's best for this country. That's what i heard in Mr. Trump's remarks last night. That's what I heard when I spoke to him directly. And i was heartened by that. That's what the country needs. A sense of unity, a sense of inclusion, a respect for our institutions, our way of life, rule of law, and a respect for each other. I hope that he maintains that spirit throughout this transition, and I certainly hope that's how his presidency has a chance to begin.\"\n\nBut the sting of Trump's victory will last well beyond the transition period as the framework of Obama's presidential legacy comes under siege by Republicans who fought him tooth and nail for eight years and who, in January, will control the White House and both chambers of Congress. \n\nDuring rally after rally on Clinton's behalf, Obama cautioned voters that electing Trump would mean watching his accomplishments on jobs, health care, foreign policy, climate change and equality go \"down the drain.\" \n\nHe warned his coalition of African-Americans and young people that he would \"consider it a personal insult -- an insult to my legacy\" if they didn't propel Clinton to the type of electoral victory they helped him achieve. Those voters did not turn out in the same levels they did for Obama, despite his aggressive overtures. \n\nDuring every battleground rally or radio phone-in, he declared Trump \"uniquely unqualified\" to hold his office, warning against allowing the brash billionaire near the nuclear codes. He spent the last 18 months reassuring his foreign counterparts that Trump's proclamations about America don't reflect the country's real values. \n\nLike all Democrats, Obama faces a reckoning about the true makeup of the American electorate, and his party's prospects going forward. But he also awakens Wednesday with the bitter responsibly of handing the US government to the man whose actions he openly fears. \n\n\"This is somebody who would do damage to our democracy,\" Obama said of Trump in Florida last week, adding Trump made him \"fear for the Republic.\" \n\nReadying assault on Obama priorities\n\nTrump has promised to scrap Obama's signature health care law, which has become increasingly fragile as costs spike and insurers withdraw from exchanges. The fixes that Obama insists will reinforce the Affordable Care Act now appear to have little chance of moving forward.\n\nTrump's transition team has been developing plans to reverse the patchwork of executive actions that Obama devised to skirt a Republican Congress on immigration and climate change. That includes Obama's unilateral moves easing deportation enforcement and his regulations on power plants. \n\nEven before Obama leaves office, those actions remain mired in legal challenges and haven't yet taken effect. Proponents of the moves had claimed if they eventually did take hold, their positive impact on society would make it difficult for future presidents to reverse them. Having never taken full effect, there's little expectation now those actions will ever be realized. \n\nTrump has committed to withdrawing the US from trade agreements, including the pending Trans Pacific Partnership that Obama has championed. So, too, has Trump said he would remove the US from the agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear ambitions and from a global climate accord signed in Paris last year. \n\nThe fate of the Supreme Court, with a GOP Senate now under no pressure to take up Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, is likely sealed. Trump has named several conservatives as potential justices; it's likely he'll have multiple seats to fill as the court's older members approach retirement. \n\nTone of final months\n\nIn the coming weeks, administration officials are expected to work on cementing what elements of Obama's unfinished agenda they can, either through new executive orders or action in the lame duck Congress. \n\nObama himself is expected to deliver a major address on democracy next week in Greece -- the ancient birthplace of that type of government -- and to meet for a final time with close US allies. Those meetings are now expected to center on shoring up shared priorities as trans-Atlantic alliances face an uncertain future. \n\nBut even as Obama works in his final weeks to salvage what he can of his agenda, there's little doubt that his message of hopefulness has suffered a deep setback. \n\nThe tone of the just-concluded presidential contest is perhaps the best reflection of his inability to improve the tenor of American political life. When he announced his presidential run in 2007, Obama decried the \"the smallness of our politics\" and vowed to reform Washington. \n\nEight years later, the race to succeed devolved into one of the darkest national election races in memory, a bitter and ugly fight between two deeply unpopular candidates. \n\n\"It's one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,\" Obama said in his final State of the Union address earlier this year.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.3854961395263703, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 973, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.7580981459799998, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161109130000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 2.26104830421377, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/02/health/hypochondriac-health/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 804, "scraper_regex": 857}}, "headline": "Hypochondriacs more likely to have health problems, study says", "wordcount_as_scraped": 857, "date": "20161202120000", "story_content": "A complicated part of being human: living with the knowledge of your own impending death. So it's somewhat understandable if your mind might have wandered into worst-case-scenario mode that time you had a bad bout of the flu, or thought a weird twinge in your finger was the beginnings of a medical emergency. (Dr. Google certainly doesn't help.)\n\nBut for some people, worrying about their health becomes a debilitating cause of distress. Psychiatrists call this \"health anxiety,\" though you might call it hypochondria; whatever the term, it's more common than you might think, affecting an estimated 1 to 2 percent of the population. But here's the irony: People who are overly worried about their health are also more likely to actually develop some serious health problems, according to a large new study out of Norway, published this month in the journal BMJ Open. Sometimes being right does indeed suck.\n\nResearchers studied the health of 7,052 participants of the Norwegian Hordaland Health Study, which is a long-term research project by the National Health Screening Service and the University of Bergen. Adding to the 13 years of already-collected data, the researchers assessed participants' levels of health anxiety and their health. They found that 3.3 percent of the participants had had a heart attack or bout of acute angina, but there were twice as many people with health anxiety in this group than those without.\n\nThe powerful overlooked weapon against the flu\n\nAll in all, those with high levels of health anxiety were 70 percent more likely to develop heart disease. The researchers concluded that anxiety should be regarded as a risk factor for coronary heart disease.\n\nThis research didn't assess causality -- in other words, it can't tell us why health anxiety was linked to a higher risk of heart disease. It could be that the hypochondriacs could sense some of those early symptoms that would eventually develop into disease, giving them good reason to worry. Or it could be that all that worrying could trigger heart issues, as other research has suggested.\n\n\"Stress causes us to secrete cortisol, a hormone which in the short term energizes us, but in the long term, in high doses, can have corrosive effects on various organs in the body and increase, for example, atherosclerosis, which is a risk factor for heart disease,\" explained Ian Robertson, author of the upcoming book \"The Stress Test: How Pressure Can Make You Stronger and Sharper.\" For people with health anxiety, it's particularly difficult to avoid this dangerous stress.\n\n\"Our bodies are always with us, and the various sensations and aches that all bodies experience are also always with us,\" Robertson added. \"If you are anxious about health, then cues for anxiety are omnipresent, unlike, for example, in people who are anxious about flying or heights.\"\n\nA healthy lifestyle could counteract genes for heart disease\n\nLine Iden Berge, one of the study co-authors and a researcher and PhD candidate at the University of Bergen in Norway, told Science of Us that before conducting the study, she'd guessed that the data would show the opposite -- that hypochondriacs might be healthier than non-hypochondriacs. After all, their anxiety should be driving them to monitor their health more closely and schedule more frequent checkups than those without health anxiety. But in this study, those behaviors didn't correlate with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease.\n\nFor that matter, health anxiety doesn't always spur people to make more medical appointments. \"What the medical profession does not understand is that people with health anxiety often both seek reassurance for some conditions but also avoid help when others would seek it,\" Richard Morriss, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Nottingham, told Science of Us. (Morriss was not involved in this new research.) \"Sometimes they seek help for trivial problems, but not for more serious ones.\" So it's also possible that their biggest potential health problems go undiagnosed and untreated.\n\nThe surprising link between anxiety and pain\n\nIt's not a perfect study, Morriss said, as it included little ethnic diversity; he also noted that the study did not adequately control for some risk factors for heart disease, including diet and exercise. But it does bring up an intriguing question: Could the news that health anxiety may indeed be linked to poorer health only serve to increase hypochondriacs' hypochondria? Morriss, for his part, doesn't think so.\n\n\"I don't think there are any substantial risks in talking publicly about health anxiety because people who have it are already very conscious of health information,\" he said. \"There may be a few vulnerable younger people made worse by discussing it, especially if it's done in a patronizing, stigmatizing or discriminatory way. ...

But even now, as a part of the European Union as well as a member of the NATO military alliance, the threat from Moscow still lingers. \n\nColonel Ilmars Lejins of the Latvian Armed Forces says he considers Latvia's enormous Russian neighbor his primary threat.\n\n\"Our neighbor to the East has shown his intents and capability of disrespecting international law and treaty obligations,\" Lejins says.\u00a0\"So I must consider that in my military planning.\"\n\nEnter Trump\n\nTensions in eastern Europe have been ratcheting up ever since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the US military presence in the region has increased significantly. \n\nBut the election of Donald Trump has thrown the Baltic States, including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (who rely heavily on US protection), into a great deal of uncertainty.  \n\nDuring the campaign, Trump outlined a sharp break in US foreign policy tradition, suggesting the US wouldn't defend NATO allies, including the Baltic states, against Russian aggression if they haven't \"fulfilled their obligation to us.\"\n\nThis rhetoric, combined with his public admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, has left many in Europe concerned that a new Cold War with Putin is coming. \n\nPublicly, officials in Baltic countries are taking a wait-and-see approach. They stress that they have dramatically increased defense expenditures for the next several years while reminding the US that they have contributed troops to US-led military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nFormer Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, who famously fought and lost a war against Russia in 2008, predicts the next several months could be particularly tense. \n\n\"Baltic countries are so vulnerable,\" Saakashvili told CNN from Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, where he is forming a local political party. \n\n\"We see that the military potential of these three countries (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) cannot match, in any way, the Russian military. And the problem is: I don't see large European powers coming to their help.\"\n\nHow long will Trump's Russian honeymoon last?\n\nOn the defensive\n\nIn a snowy field in Latvia, cannons lob artillery shells at distant targets. A pair of Blackhawk helicopters land, and soldiers from the US Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade pour out, firing a rocket attached to a long cord laced with explosives.\u00a0It detonates, a simulation of how soldiers would blow a path through a deadly minefield in the event of a conflict.\u00a0\n\nUS troops are performing military maneuvers with the Latvian military and a platoon of soldiers from Slovenia as part of a series of joint exercises called \"Atlantic Resolve.\"\n\n\"The origins were in response to Russian activity in 2014, when the strategic situation changed,\" said Colonel Gregory Anderson, who monitored this exercise with his local counterpart Colonel Lejins. \n\nAnderson was referring to Russia's lightning-swift occupation and annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea.\n\nTo confuse and then push Ukrainian troops out of the region, Russia deployed so-called \"little green men,\" well-disciplined Russian forces who wore uniforms without insignia or flags identifying their country of origin.\n\nThe well-choreographed operation has served as a wake-up call to the new strength and sophistication of the Russian military.\u00a0\n\nHow small states prepare for cyber-war\n\nOn the lookout for potential enemies\u00a0\n\nIf a conflict suddenly exploded with Russia, Latvian commanders say their forces would present little more than a \"speed bump\" to an advancing Russian military.\n\n\"Therefore, the US presence here is very important to deter Russian attempts or simply to avoid miscalculation,\" says Garisons, Latvia's secretary of state.\n\nLatvian officials say, Russia has amassed two armies with an estimated 200,000 troops on the other side of the border.\u00a0Five years ago, Russia reestablished a helicopter base with scores of aircraft at a location a short drive from the Latvian border.\u00a0\n\nTo protect itself and its population of nearly two million people, Latvia has only 5,000 professional troops as well as a much larger force of volunteer National Guards.\n\n\"We need to be a good speed bump that takes out the muffler of the enemy so that it is loud enough that there is no question that this is military aggression against one NATO member,\" Colonel Lejins explains. \"Then the activation of (Article 5) occurs.\"\n\nUnder Article 5 of the NATO charter, an attack on one member is considered an attack on all countries in the alliance and requires an active response.\n\nRussian doorstep in Europe\n\nNext, we drive cross country from Latvia, across Lithuania and into Kaliningrad, an exclave of Russian territory sandwiched between Poland and the Baltics, cut off from mainland Russia.\n\nAt the end of World War II, Soviet Red Army soldiers wrenched control of this territory from Nazi Germany. For decades, it was a heavily militarized region, closed off to foreigners.\n\nThe region lurched into the headlines last fall after Russia confirmed reports it deployed nuclear-capable Iskender missiles to Kaliningrad.\n\n\u00a0Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov defended Russia's right to deploy weapons to its sovereign territory in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour last October. \n\n\"They moved NATO infrastructure next to our borders,\" Lavrov said.\u00a0\"And this is not United States territory.\"\n\nIn many ways, Kaliningrad is a historical curiosity. The streets of the main city, which was known in German times as Konigsberg, are lined with grand examples of old German architecture alongside grim, concrete Soviet apartment blocks. \n\nHere, some Russians also expressed hope about the next US government.\u00a0\n\n\"With the change of leadership in the US we are hoping for an improvement in the situation,\" says Konstantin Smernov, a 53-year-old former lieutenant in the Soviet Navy who now works as a real estate agent. \"Confrontation isn't good for anybody.\" \u00a0\n\nWestern governments imposed economic sanctions on Russia after the seizure of Crimea in 2014. In restaurants and in homes here, many Russians said those measures contributed to a broader economic crisis that set in after the plunge in oil prices in recent years.\u00a0 Oil and natural gas are two of Russia's most important exports and the backbone of the country's economy.\n\nThose sanctions, combined with a move last summer to remove visa-free travel for Kaliningrad residents traveling to neighboring Poland, have some here concerned about the former Soviet citadel's increasing isolation.\n\nWhy Russia has been ramping up hostile action\n\nAnna Shugatova was born after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Her dream was to find a job that would allow her to travel. But the 23-year-old, who moved to Kaliningrad from her home in Siberia to pursue a master's degree in linguistics, says that dream is now in doubt. \n\n\"I don't know if I will be able to travel soon. There are tensions between countries,\" Shugatova said.\n\nEchoes of the Cold War\n\nBut several Russians say they've found one advantage to living in an enclave with relatively easy access to countries like Poland and Lithuania. Visitors can purchase and smuggle in foreign foods that are now banned in Russia.\u00a0\n\n\"We are back to the days of smuggling cheese and sausage from abroad,\" said Igor Pleshkov, a businessman and vocal critic of the Kremlin who describes himself as the sole elected member of the opposition on Kaliningrad's city council.\n\nThe Russian port of Baltiysk, about a 45-minute drive towards the coast, is still very much a militarized garrison town. Warships from the Russian Navy's Baltic Sea Fleet moor at the town entrance, while rows of olive-green military trucks and armored vehicles can be seen in several nearby compounds. \n\nOne of the striking oddities about this region is the dozens of ruined German churches dotting the countryside.\u00a0These crumbling places of worship stand partially collapsed and empty, symbols of what happened the last time armies fought for control of this part of Europe.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.08339166641235, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1303, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.6628760938, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161223090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.53261703760553, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/politics/latino-voters-ohio/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00f1": [1701]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 999, "scraper_regex": 1099}}, "headline": "Latinos in Ohio could be the decisive factor for the election", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1099, "date": "20161104110000", "story_content": "It's a recent Tuesday morning at Fiesta Jalisco Mexican Restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, and Victor Sandoval is preparing the daily food specials. \n\nAs you walk into the kitchen, your eyes may sting from the aroma of the freshly-chopped onions but instantly feel refreshed as you walk by a man chopping cilantro. They are key ingredients in the house salsa, a recipe Sandoval has used for decades.\n\nSandoval, who spoke to CNN after the final presidential debate had taken place, came to the US as an immigrant from Mexico in 1986, when he was 18 years old. He became a citizen in 1993 and lived in a few places around the country, but eventually moved to Ohio.  \n\n\"Columbus is a good market for restaurants,\" he said. \"It's growing like crazy. We have Latinos everywhere.\"\n\nSandoval now owns two restaurants and says that's why on November 8 he'll vote for the presidential candidate that will make life better for him as a businessman.\n\nStark County, Ohio, is a swing county in a swing state\n\nHe's registered as a Republican, but adds that \"doesn't mean I have to vote for that one because I always go with the party that offers more benefits for me and my family.\"\n\nSandoval says he never votes a straight-party ticket. When Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012, Sandoval was one of the Latino voters who helped the first black president capture the Buckeye State. He believed Obama was going to change immigration policy, something Sandoval says remains a high priority for him.\n\nFor the last two decades, attention has been focused on Ohio during presidential election years. In a City University of New York study commissioned by CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, 1.8% of total voters who cast their ballots in Ohio in 2012 were Latino. Obama won the state by 1.9%.\n\nHow the Latino vote could affect the 2016 race\n\nFour years later and the state's population increase indicates about 2.2% of votes around Ohio will come from Latinos. Despite the fact that the Hispanic population is so small in the Ohio, the study shows Latinos could very well be the decisive factor in the election.\n\n\"The Latino vote is important not because it's a big number, but because it represents a big impact when it comes to the elections,\" says German Trejo, a political consultant with experience running campaigns on both sides of the aisle. He says Ohio's electorate is, for the most part, set -- with the exception of about 100,000 voters, most of whom are undecided Latino voters.\n\n\"Out of those 100,000, Latinos have a big chunk of that population and if they go and cast their ballot, they'll account for between 20% and 80% of that margin of victory,\" Trejo said. \"These are voters that traditionally stay at home, but in this election, because of the nature of the political candidates and rhetoric that is going on between the two parties, I think the Latino community is motivated and will go and vote in their best interest, whatever that interest is.\"\n\nOhio also outpaces the rest of the country in one aspect when it comes to Latino voters. According to the CUNY study, Ohio registration rates for Latinos in 2012 were at 69%, well above the national average of 58.7%. For 2016, that rate is expected to increase.\n\nPolls: Clinton, Trump neck-and-neck in Florida; new results in NC, PA and Ohio\n\n\"Elections are won and lost by the slimmest of margins and we provide that margin of victory to most of the electorate,\" says Juan Molina Crespo. Crespo heads up the Hispanic Alliance of Cleveland, a grassroots, non-profit group that works to increase voter registration. He knows the importance of the Latino vote in the northeastern part of the state.\n\n\"When you look at the state of Ohio, we have three counties out of the 88 counties that typically vote Democrat, and in those three counties we also have the highest number of Latinos in the state,\" he said.\n\nCrespo looks at Cleveland, in Cuyahoga County, with the highest density of Latinos in the entire state.\n\nCuyahoga County, Ohio, could be Clinton's bright spot\n\n\"President Obama won Ohio in the previous two elections in large part by very, very slim margins,\" he says, \"and that slim margin was predicated upon the Latino vote.\"\n\nBut Crespo points to problems in political camps with their last-minute push for the Latino vote here. \"It's critical,\" he says. \"Unfortunately, I think both parties do a dismal job of courting the Latino vote until the 11th hour.\"\n\nNow, with just a few days until the election, some voters in Ohio are already casting their ballots, forcing local Latinos to decide now which candidate has their best interests at heart.\n\nRELATED: Latino vote: Will the sleeping giant finally choose the next president?\n\n\"I just want to encourage all the Latinos to be more united,\" says Yasin Cuevas, a Puerto Rican transplant to Ohio and entrepreneur. \"To vote for those who can't, to understand that we are a community of unity, family-oriented and to see the candidates and watch which one more embraces our values and morals.\"\n\nCuevas moved to Northern Ohio a decade ago and teaches modeling techniques as the director of Miss Ohio Latina. She says politics comes into conversation with her clients a lot.\n\n\"I remind them they have the right vote. Before we didn't, and this is something really important that can affect who we are as women and what rights we have in the society,\" she says.\n\nCuevas says she's learned that most Latino families have similar priorities in what they want from a commander-in-chief, regardless of how small the number may be.\n\n\"We are a powerful community and (we've grown) so (much) in the last years and it's really important,\" she says.\n\nExperts like Trejo point to Obama's narrow victory in Ohio four years ago as an example of why all candidates know the importance of winning the state and why they spend so much time and money here.\n\n\"The state of Ohio has 18 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to win the White House,\" he said. \"The state of Ohio is one of the top two important states to win the White House, and that's why presidential campaigns pay so much attention to this state in particular.\"\n\nBut with only a 2% voting base, it's a wonder Latinos in Ohio can make such a major difference on Election Day.\n\n\"Here in Ohio that 2% could be decisive,\" Trejo said, \"And as we know: as Ohio goes, so goes the nation.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.64043915271759, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 999, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.46843844634, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161104110000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 2.4024024024023998, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/health/background-checks-school-shootings/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 543, "scraper_regex": 578}}, "headline": "Can gun background checks help prevent school shootings?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 578, "date": "20161207000000", "story_content": "The chance a child will get shot at school is significantly lower if their state has mandatory background checks, according to a study released Wednesday in the journal Injury Prevention. Children also have better odds if their states spend more on mental health and education.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans consistently say they want more background checks when polled, but no federal law mandates them, and state laws vary.\n\nThough some have questioned the impact of background checks, researchers wanted to see whether states with them have fewer shootings, as well as to determine other trends around school shootings.\n\nThe authors combed through media accounts and found 154 shootings at kindergarten-through-12th-grade schools between January 2013 and December 2015. That's about one a week, a dramatic increase from past decades when there was about one a year, at least between 1966 and 2008. \n\nAfter totaling the number of shootings, the authors looked closer at where they happened and determined that there were fewer incidents in states that had mandatory background checks for gun and ammo purchases. These states also tended to spend more on education and mental health services. Past studies have showed that increased education (PDF) spending can be a deterrent to crime and gun violence. \n\nThough some of the demographic data of the shooters was unavailable, researchers did see a few other trends. More than 99% of the shooters were male. Most shootings were deliberate. And children who live in urban areas are most vulnerable to getting shot at school. \n\nThe researchers said they created this study because there are gaps in knowledge about what factors made a school more vulnerable to shootings. With the increase in the number of incidents, they believe, more than ever, there is an urgent need to find ways to stop them. \n\n\"Even having one shooting a year is a horrific event, as school shootings leave a great big scar on a community with long-lasting psychological consequences,\" said author Dr. Bindu Kalesan, an assistant professor of medicine at the Boston University School of Medicine. \"It's as devastating as if we had a volcanic eruption in the neighborhood.\"\n\n\"School shootings are becoming less rare, and that is a big concern,\" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, who was not involved in the study. He found it interesting but would add that, based on previous research, the No. 1 factor in shootings is gun ownership. \n\n\"When you have a larger number of guns, you see a larger number of shootings,\" Webster said.\n\nNew York, for instance, which has a number of restrictive ownership laws, didn't have a single school shooting in the time studied. The state also has comprehensive approval system in which people can be denied a gun if the approving authority spots a red flag, even if they pass the background check. With that in mind, what one factor matters most \"may be hard to tease out,\" he said.\n\nShootings at schools do have devastating consequences, not only for the person who has been shot.\n\nResearch has showed that shootings can dramatically lower area students' test scores (PDF) and can cause students long-term psychological problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, even for those who have not witnessed the event.\n\n\"Apathy can sometimes set in when there are so many incidents, but one shooting is too many,\" Kalesan said. \"Hopefully, this research can help us work toward a better solution than what we have now.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.77249574661255, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 543, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.642824346533, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 4, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.736648250460405, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.363636363636}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/donald-trump-republicans-confusion-immigration-ban/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 548, "scraper_regex": 825}}, "headline": "Trump move leads to confusion and chaos between White House, Congress", "wordcount_as_scraped": 825, "date": "20170130230000", "story_content": "Confusion and chaos.\n\nIt's not the imagery one might expect from a President who promised to bring private sector competency to governing.\n\nBut in temporarily halting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspending the Syrian refugee program, President Donald Trump and his team acted more like he did as a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants candidate than an orderly CEO, giving little direction to those expected to interpret and carry out orders that have real world consequences.\n\n\"You have an extreme vetting proposal that didn't get the vetting it should have had,\" Republican Sen.

Five courts temporarily blocked the President's order on travel restrictions, and while Congress hasn't passed legislation, they did voice loud concerns.\n\nIt is an open question as to whether Trump and his team -- advisers like Steve Bannon who never worked in government -- will learn a hard lesson about governing and all its implications, or whether stirring controversy and doing things differently, is exactly what they think Trump was elected to do.'\n\nRubio: State wouldn't discuss ban\n\nSen.

So this is a big change and it has a lot of moving parts and a lot of agencies and thousands of individuals task with enforcing it and applying it. Some of whom in the early stages at least we're not confident in how they were to proceed.\"\n\nRubio's office later said the department provided a general Q&A fact sheet.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.1825795173645, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 548, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.03685059113, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170130230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.37956204379562, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/27/autos/motorcycles-2016/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2819], "\u00a3": [4139, 4888]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1313, "scraper_regex": 1433}}, "headline": "Raw, edgy and super-naked: The top motorcycles of 2016", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1433, "date": "20161228010000", "story_content": "Fans of two-wheeled transportation have had plenty to excite them in 2016 -- new models, remakes and radical visions that could shake up the motorcycle industry.\n\nKey trends included the continued popularity of naked or standard bikes, that is, stripped-back versions of superbikes without fairings or windscreens. Yamaha's MT-10 for instance, offered a modern, aggressive take.\n\nMeanwhile enthusiasm for retro bikes grew, with British brands Triumph and Norton leading a revival of classically styled machines. Triumph's Bonneville Bobber demonstrates how modern technologies can be both integrated and concealed.\n\nPolice superbikes: The new breed of driverless vehicles\n\nAs well as looking to the past, the motorcycle industry is addressing the need for future vehicles to adopt more efficient propulsion technologies. Italian firm Piaggio announced that it will release an electric version of the iconic Vespa in 2017, while Swiss company Zvexx unveiled a prototype for a hedonistic electric speed machine.\n\nLooking even further ahead, some firms presented progressive concepts that embrace cutting-edge technologies such as 3D printing for lightweight frames (APWorks' Light Rider) and self-balancing safety assistance systems that prevent crashes (BMW's Motorrad Vision Next 100).\n\nThis selection provides an overview of some of the top rides around this year, along with a few that might take a while to hit the road.\n\nVanguard Roadster\n\nThe first release from New York City firm Vanguard is a roadster targeted at the premium end of the motorcycle market. A utilitarian approach to the vehicle's design has resulted in a clean aesthetic. A reduced number of parts also helps to bring down the price. \n\n\"We combine design and engineering to create our own language, without relying on heritage and nostalgia,\" says the company's co-founder and head of design, Edward Jacobs. \n\nVanguard has custom engineered many of the components used in the Roadster, enabling it to create consistency throughout its design. \n\nMost of the parts are finished in raw aluminum to enhance its industrial appearance, while a carbon-fiber fuel tank, a flat screen displaying the instruments, and a rear-view parking camera introduce some distinctly contemporary details. The bike was presented at a recent International Motorcycle Show and is planned for production in 2018.\n\nZvexx P1\n\nSwiss firm Zvexx produced this eye-catching prototype to demonstrate that electric motorcycles can deliver outstanding performance with the looks to match. The Zvexx P1 features radical aerodynamic bodywork made from lightweight materials such as carbon fiber. \n\n\"With this bike, we demonstrate that an electric drive can look fierce and behave like a beast,\" the bike's designers say. \"This is\u00a0not a project in user-friendly cuteness but a fusion of raw, biker appeal and unbridled electric force.\"\n\nRead: The world's most beautiful car? \n\nPromising \"brutal acceleration,\" its makers claim the P1 can reach 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph) from a standing start in approximately three seconds.\n\nThe company may produce a limited series at some point in the future, but for now just a single P1 exists, cruising silently around the roads near Lake Geneva.\n\nYamaha MT-10\n\nWhen Yamaha's hotly anticipated MT-10 hit the roads earlier this year it didn't disappoint, with many experts including it on their lists of the best motorcycles of 2016. \n\nDistinctive bodywork and bug-eyed headlamps make for a machine that wouldn't look out of place in one of the \"Transformers\" movies. The expressive styling isn't to everyone's taste, but it helps to enhance the raw, edgy super-naked look, and the combination of dark grey and fluorescent details is definitely on trend.\n\nRead: Menswear and motorcycles: Meet the most stylish bikers \n\nBuilt on the same engine and chassis platform as the brand's R1, the MT-10 is tweaked to provide optimal performance on public roads. By stripping away some of the expensive materials and technologies employed in the R1, the MT-10 is also cheaper and stacks up well against rivals in the \u00a310,000 ($12,280) price bracket.\n\nDucati 1299 Superleggera\n\nFor a combination of raw speed and contemporary racer styling, the new Ducati 1299 Superleggera is hard to beat, and the Italian firm's latest superbike turned plenty of heads at the recent EICMA 2016 bike show in Milan. \n\nThe Superleggera is the most powerful twin-cylinder production bike Ducati has ever produced, and a focus on reducing weight and increasing power has resulted in the first factory bike to be equipped with a carbon-fiber frame, subframe, swingarm and wheels. \n\nDucati made some bold claims at the launch of the 1299 Superleggera, stating that it is the world's most technologically advanced production superbike. The price of all this power, beauty and technology is \u00a372,000 ($88,430), and the company says that all 500 units to be built have already sold.\n\nHusqvarna Vitpilen 401\n\nSwedish brand Husqvarna unveiled its Vitpilen 401 and Svartpilen 401 at EICMA 2016. The machines are the first models produced as part of Husqvarna's \"Real Street\" range -- a progressive vision of street motorcycling based on honesty and accessibility.\n\nTargeted at a new generation of riders, the machines have a simple, pared-down aesthetic, with sleek bodywork lending them a contemporary edge. A single-cylinder 375cc engine borrowed from parent company KTM's 390 Duke produces 44 horsepower.\n\nAlongside the production-ready models, the firm showed its Vitpilen 401 Aero concept, which adds fluid aerodynamic fairing to the basic design. A windshield that channels air through the engine to regulate cooling also contributes to a fuller and more balanced design. The Vitpilen 401 and Svartpilen 401 are due in showrooms in the autumn of 2017.\n\nTriumph Bonneville Bobber\n\nThe new Bonneville Bobber from Triumph takes the British brand's distinguished heritage for producing custom Bobbers as the starting point for a new interpretation of this classic racing-style motorcycle.\n\nThe Bobber's low stance, single seat and wide, flat handlebars, its minimal bodywork, and sculpted fuel tank combined, make for a head-turning cruising machine. \n\nPleasing retro details like the exposed frame and battery box with stainless-steel strap, enhance the classic appeal of a bike that manages to incorporate plenty of modern technology in a simple yet precisely detailed package.\n\nIn keeping with the Bobber's customizable tradition, Triumph offers over 150 accessories.\n\nHonda CRF1000L Africa Twin\n\nNamed by AutoTrader as overall winner of its Best Bike Awards 2016, the Honda Africa Twin is a dual-purpose adventure bike designed to be as competent off road as it is mixing with traffic or cruising on a carriageway.\n\nThe first XRV650 Africa Twin was launched in 1988, inspired by the Dakar Rally-winning NXR750, and was responsible for revolutionizing the market for long-distance touring motorcycles. Honda's highly anticipated return to this model is offered in a range of rally paintwork options that connect it with its racing heritage.\n\nAn all-new 4-stroke 1000cc parallel twin engine provides the power needed for extreme off-road conditions and ensures a comfortable ride over long distances, with a range of up to 248 miles. It's an agile yet robust machine with a high ground clearance suited to off-roading.\n\nAPWorks Light Rider\n\nReducing weight is key to improving efficiency and speed, and this prototype unveiled earlier in the year by aerospace specialist Airbus Group's APWorks division demonstrates how the latest 3D-printing technology could be employed to manufacture lightweight motorcycles with skeletal mainframes. \n\nBionic algorithms were used to generate an organically influenced structure that encloses a 6 kilowatt electric motor, providing the required stiffness while optimizing material usage. \n\nAPWorks described the 35-kilogram machine as \"probably the world's lightest motorcycle prototype,\" with a power-to-weight ratio \"equal to that of a supercar.\"\n\nThe frame itself weighs just six kilograms, and is produced from aircraft-grade aluminum. The complex form is built up in layers by a 3D printer that translates a digital file into a seamless structure by fusing metal powder using a laser. A small series of street-legal Light Rider bikes are planned for production.\n\nBMW Motorrad Vision Next 100\n\nOne of the most talked-about concepts of the year was BMW's Motorrad Vision Next 100, which employs self-balancing technology to prevent crashes and enable the rider to dismount without using a kickstand. \n\nThe German firm's confidence in the ability of advanced assistance systems to prevent the bike from tilting over means that helmets could be replaced by a visor with a display providing data about the ride.\n\nThe vehicle's radical form references the triangular frame of BMW's first ever motorcycle, but is built around an emissionless electric drive unit. The frame is also flexible and bends as the bike is maneuvered, meaning traditional joints are no longer needed.\n\nAs a concept, the Motorrad Vision Next 100 fulfills the brief of presenting an exciting vision of the future. It remains to be seen how many of the innovations it proposes are implementable in real-life scenarios.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.87474322319031, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1313, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.8999540851469999, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161228010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.761614623000762, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/15/opinions/trump-has-time-for-kanye-what-about-veterans-rieckhoff/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Trump has time for Kanye, but where's his promised focus on veterans issues?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 966, "date": "20161215220000", "story_content": "In 2014, the nation watched in outrage as the Veterans Affairs scandal erupted in Phoenix. When the widespread failures surfaced and later VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned, a massive void was left to be filled and a huge undertaking needed to turn around the second largest government agency. \n\nVA's brand was shattered. Every veterans group in America was pleading for overdue reform and a 21st century VA. The time was ripe to achieve it. But it also presented unparalleled resources with a budget around $180 billion and more than 300,000 employees -- many of whom were veterans themselves. This was our once-in-a-generation moment to turn a crisis into an opportunity. \n\nAs the secretary position lay vacant, speculation as to the next leader of the largest integrated health care system in the United States abounded. At the time, IAVA called for the President to appoint a post-9/11 veteran, or someone very familiar with our growing, diverse community -- someone who was a proven, dynamic public servant we could trust. A leader who was a unique hybrid -- a proactive change agent who understood a changing community of over 21 million veterans, and also had a mastery of technology, health care, the media and Congress. We got that leader in Bob McDonald. \n\nAs soon as this week, President-elect Donald Trump could finally announce his pick to be the next VA secretary. Over the last month, lots of folks have visited Trump Tower, including rapper Kanye West. But not a single leader from our nation's leading veteran service organizations has been invited upstairs. \n\nSo far the only engagement between the veterans' organizations and the transition was a behind-the-scenes meeting with opening remarks by reality TV star Omarosa Manigault.\n\nNames in the news as prospective VA chiefs have flown scattershot and range from Sarah Palin to Scott Brown. None has the critical skills our veterans deserve right now. We need a leader with business savvy, who embraces values-based leadership, and who will continue the momentum initiated in the last two years. Bob McDonald is that kind of leader. \n\nAs a Republican, West Point graduate and former CEO of Procter and Gamble, if McDonald wasn't already VA secretary, he'd likely be among Trump's top candidates. He's reflective of the attitude, career of private sector success and Washington outsider profile President-elect Trump has already chosen in so many of his other appointments.\n\nIn 2014, after undertaking his own assessment of VA, Bob McDonald presented Congress with a plan to transform the organization. Leaders on both sides of the aisle and the veteran community agreed that this was the right strategy. Since then, an independent commission (the Commission on Care) has laid out a similar framework and multiple independent assessments have concurred. \n\nThat framework is one that embraces a more integrated system of health care that provides a balance between the critical services that VA provides to veterans and the need for community partners to supplement where VA cannot provide that care. It addresses the outdated infrastructure and lagging IT systems at the VA. It tackles the need for change agents in leadership positions and addresses the challenges to holding failed leaders accountable. In short, it provides a comprehensive plan to move the VA into the 21st century. \n\nWhen you're deep in the middle of a fight, it's not the time to change horses. In 2008, President Obama recognized this after his election by wisely retaining the fantastic Bob Gates to continue leading the Pentagon. It was a bipartisan move that gave our troops the extended leadership of one of the finest leaders of our time.\n\nNow is not the time to stop the progress or change the course. In just two years, the VA has continued to have some very high-profile challenges. No doubt it's been bumpy. But outside the media attention, it has also achieved more than we expected. There have been major access improvements, more integration of technology, addressing of leadership challenges, and the opening of doors to public-private partnerships. The veteran service organizations have been a welcome partner in all this. \n\nThis is not just McDonald's plan. It belongs to all of us now. As demand for VA services ranging from mental health care to the post-9/11 GI Bill continues to grow and change rapidly, this is no time to throw it all out and start over. And it's definitely not the time to introduce radical change like full-scale privatization, which most of the leading veterans groups ferociously oppose. \n\nIAVA members, 80% of whom are enrolled in VA health care, want to see the VA improve. They like VA care, but also note that it has its challenges. And while certainly not perfect, the VA is on the right path to reform. That is despite a dangerously divided Congress and a painful lack of adequate support and attention from President Obama. \n\nThe Trump administration and the next VA secretary will inherit many challenges in continuing to reform the VA. They will also inherit the opportunity to do what no modern president has done: fix the VA. \n\nCandidate Trump often said on the campaign trail that veterans' issues were a priority of his campaign. Veterans of all generations responded and voted for him by nearly two-to-one. Now, it's time for him to show us we'll be a priority of his presidency. \n\nThe job of VA secretary might be the second hardest in Washington, especially in a time of seemingly never-ending war. But just like we saw in combat, no leader can win alone. We're all in this together. And America's veteran service organizations are the air support, intelligence network and ground forces critical to supporting the fight. We are the troops in this battle for reform. And our choice for our leader is clear. Our incoming commander in chief should hear our calls.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.381315529346466, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 952, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 16, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.278993142169999, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.20168067226891, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/08/health/lung-cancer-symptoms/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 758, "scraper_regex": 834}}, "headline": "The lung cancer symptoms even nonsmokers need to know", "wordcount_as_scraped": 834, "date": "20161208120000", "story_content": "Ashley Rivas was 26 when she noticed she was getting tired earlier than usual on her runs. Over the next few years, the X-ray technician from Albuquerque, New Mexico, developed a persistent cough and wheezing, which her doctors attributed to exercise-induced asthma. She had other symptoms, too: weight loss, fever, and several bouts of pneumonia. \n\nStill, when Rivas finally decided to perform a chest X-ray on herself, cancer was the last thing on her mind. \n\nThe image revealed a mass on her right lung that turned out to be a malignant tumor. Rivas was 32 and had never smoked a cigarette in her life. \"I want people to know lung cancer can happen to anyone,\" she says.\n\nRivas has joined the American Lung Association's Lung Force campaign, to spread the word that her disease isn't just a smoker's affliction. \"It's true that the majority of people with lung cancer have some history of tobacco use,\" says Lung Association spokesperson Andrea McKee, MD, the chair of radiation oncology at Lahey Hospital Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts. \"Having said that, 15% of patients diagnosed with lung cancer have no history of tobacco use -- and they may be quite young.\"\n\nOther known risk factors aside from smoking include a family history of the disease, as well as exposure to certain air pollutants, such as asbestos, arsenic, radon, even diesel fumes, says Dr. McKee. Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide; and each year, it kills more women than breast, ovarian, and uterine cancer combined. \n\n25 Breast Cancer Myths Busted\n\nIf it's diagnosed early, the disease is actually highly curable, Dr. McKee says. Luckily this was the case for Rivas. She had her tumor removed in 2013, and is now thriving. (She ran a half-marathon last year!)\n\nBut only about 16% of cases are caught at stage 1. \"Usually it's like a 7- to 8-millimeter nodule sitting in the middle of a lung that doesn't have any symptoms associated with it,\" says Dr. McKee. Most patients are diagnosed later, once the tumor has grown large enough that it's \"pushing on an airway, resulting in some breathing problems,\" she explains.\n\nThat's what Marlo Palacio experienced just before the holidays in 2013, when she developed a cough unlike any cough she'd ever had before. \"I would feel like I was out of breath or gagging,\" she says. At first, the social worker from Pasadena, California, assumed she'd picked up a bug from her toddler son. But six weeks later, the cough hadn't gone away. Doctors diagnosed Palacio -- an otherwise healthy, 39-year-old non-smoker -- with stage 4 lung cancer. \n\nAt stage 4, lung symptoms like Palacio had (and others such as pneumonia and coughing up blood) may be accompanied by problems elsewhere in the body, such as back pain, bone pain, headaches, weight loss, and confusion, says Dr. McKee. That's because \"once the disease has spread, [it's] usually having an effect on a system outside of the lungs,\" she explains.\n\nAfter several different treatments, Palacio developed a new, isolated tumor in September. But she says she is doing well, physically and emotionally. \"I'm feeling pretty positive that this will be something that we can just eliminate and maintain,\" she says. \"I just accept that this is a lifelong fight for maintenance, and keeping my cancer down.\"\n\n6 Cancer-Fighting Superfoods\n\nDr. McKee is hopeful that rising awareness of lung cancer, and advances in screening will mean fewer late-stage diagnoses in the future -- because catching the disease early can make all the difference.\n\nFrida Orozco knows that fact first-hand. She was diagnosed with stage 2 in her late twenties, a few months after she developed a dry cough. \"I started to feel a pain every time I coughed on the lower side of my ribs, and also on the left side of my chest, near the clavicle,\" she says. When Orozco came down with a fever, headaches, and dizziness, she went to an urgent care facility; a chest X-ray revealed the mass in her lung. \n\nBut today, the 30-year-old student at Borough of Manhattan Community College happily reports she has been in remission for a year and a half. \"You can't even tell I've been through all of this,\" she says, \"except for the scars.\"\n\n15 Thyroid Cancer Facts Everyone Should Know\n\nSo when should you get a lingering cough checked out? \"To be safe, I would say that any cough that you're concerned about that's persisting beyond a few weeks, you should talk with your doctor,\" says Dr. McKee. \"A cough shouldn't linger beyond two or three weeks.\"\n\nIf you suspect something is not right with your health, follow up, urges Rivas. \"You know your body better than anybody,\" she says. \"Push, because you're probably right. My pulmonologist told me that if I hadn't caught [my cancer] when I did, I would've died. And it was because of my persistence. I knew something was wrong, I kept pushing.\"\n\nTo learn more lung cancer, check out the American Lung Association's Lung Force campaign.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.76701259613037, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 758, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.71044433838, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 5, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.8469656992084398, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/22/middleeast/raghad-saddam-hussein-interview/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1461, "scraper_regex": 1580}}, "headline": "Saddam Hussein's daughter: Trump has 'political sensibility'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1580, "date": "20161222100000", "story_content": "On the morning of Eid al-Adha in December 2006, Raghad Saddam Hussein, her sister and their children squeezed together in front of the television in Raghad's home in Amman and wept as they watched footage of her father being hurtled by masked men to the gallows where he would be hanged.\n\nSaddam Hussein, who ruled Iraq from 1979 until his overthrow and capture by a US-led coalition in 2003, declined to wear the hood and shed no tears as the noose was put around his neck. The Iraqiya TV broadcast ended there, but a second video -- shot on a cell phone by an onlooker below the scaffold -- emerged a few hours later showing the moment of death.\n\n\"I never saw that moment and I refuse to see it,\" Raghad, Saddam Hussein's eldest daughter, told CNN in her first interview since her father's death ten years ago.\n\nThe footage also showed witnesses hurling insults at the deposed leader, convicted of crimes against humanity for the murder of 148 Iraqi Shias in 1982; they chanted \"Moktada! Moktada! Moktada!\" in reference to militant Shia cleric Moktada al-Sadr. Saddam Hussein shot back, \"Is this how real men behave?\" before the trap sprang and the noose tightened on a man who remained defiant to the end.\n\n\"The details of his death are ugly and painful -- but it's an honorable death,\" Raghad said by phone from the Jordanian capital, where she sought refuge after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\n\"I don't think he would have gone in a death smaller than this. It was a death that brought pride to me, my children, my sisters and their children, to all those who love him and have a place for him in their heart.\"\n\nThe then US president George W. Bush, who ordered the invasion of Iraq, said just after Saddam Hussein's death that the execution \"would not have been possible without the Iraqi people's determination to create a society governed by the rule of law.\" But the sectarian subtext heard in the video of his last moments seemed to denote an ensuing era of more sectarianism and violence that would remain 10 years on.\n\nRaghad, who blames the US for the chaos that unraveled in her country, hopes that President-elect Donald Trump will be different from his predecessors.\n\n\"This man has just arrived to the leadership ... But from what is apparent, this man has a high level of political sensibility, that is vastly different than the one who preceded him,\" she told CNN. \"He exposed the mistakes of the others, specifically in terms of Iraq, which means he is very aware of the mistakes made in Iraq and what happened to my father.\"\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump said he opposed the war on Iraq, however he was publicly supportive of the invasion in interviews before and after the war. And while saying that Saddam Hussein \"was a bad guy,\" Trump has praised the former Iraqi leader's efficient killing of \"terrorists\".\n\nRaghad said she has not been involved in politics and supports no groups or parties on the ground, however, the current Iraqi government has accused the 48-year-old of supporting her father's Baath party, now outlawed, and has called on Jordan to repatriate her. \n\nMore recently it has accused her of supporting ISIS and cheer leading the militants' takeover of Mosul, allegations that she vehemently denies.\n\n\"Of course I don't have any relations to this group [ISIS] and other extremist groups,\" she told CNN. \"Moreover, the family's ideology has no similarities to that of extremist groups.\"\n\n\"As a proof to this, these groups only became powerful in Iraq after we left the country and our rule ended.\"\n\nSelf-declared jihadist groups sprung up in Iraq under the banner of fighting US army \"infidels,\" and the country became a magnet for foreign fighters. ISIS, or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, started as the Islamic State of Iraq in 2006 -- the year of Saddam Hussein's death -- and expanded to Syria in 2014, three years after the eruption of violence there.\n\nThe regime's brutality\n\nRaghad praised her father's rule for the stability she believes it offered Iraq, saying ISIS and other groups would not have been able to enter had her father still been alive.\n\nBut for many, the execution of Saddam Hussein ended the life of a brutal dictator who oppressed the people of Iraq for three decades, unleashed devastating regional wars and reduced his once flourishing oil-rich nation to a police state.\n\nHuman rights organizations reported rampant government-approved executions, acts of torture and massacres from his rise to power until his fall. His two sons, Uday and Qusay -- who died in a gun battle with US troops in 2003 --  were accused of ordering many of the atrocities.\n\n\"People (who consider him a dictator) are free to use whatever labels they want,\" Raghad said.\n\nFor her, he was \"a hero, courageous, nationalistic, a symbol to millions of people.\"\n\n\"He was a struggler and he knew that his ending was not going to be easy.\"\n\nRaghad said much of what the media says about her family is made up. \n\n\"Yes, there was brutality, sometimes a lot of it and I can't support brutality. But Iraq is a country that is difficult to rule and it's only now that people are realizing it,\" she said.\n\nRaghad said she, her two sisters and her mother were not involved in the decisions the men made.\n\n\"The women of the family were not allowed to contribute. They only answered when they were asked -- and they were never asked.\"\n\nDuring two of the biggest massacres committed in Iraq during her father's rule -- the Dujeil massacre in 1982 and the Halabja gas attack to quell a Kurdish uprising in the late 1980s -- Raghad said she was still a teenager with very little awareness of what was happening in the country. \n\nBy the time she was in her twenties, she had five children to raise and university classes for her degree in English translation to attend. \n\n\"I was a very studious. Studying is how I spent most of my time,\" Raghad said.\n\nGiven that satellite dishes were banned in the country during her father's rule, she said that she herself also did not have access to information about what was happening at the time.\n\nRelationship with father\n\nAt 15, Raghad was married to Hussein Kamel, a high-ranking military official who oversaw Iraq's buildup of missiles, the country's nuclear research program, and its chemical and biological weapons. Her sister, Rana, married Kamel's brother, another senior official. In 1995, the brothers defected with their wives to Amman. \n\nLess than a year later, Saddam Hussein convinced them to return to Iraq, promising them amnesty. But upon their arrival, he ordered the men to divorce his daughters. They were killed three days later by her father's men.\n\nMany theories emerged as to why the Kamel brothers defected. Jordanian King Abdullah in his book cited a clash with Saddam Hussein's eldest son Uday, adding that he speculated that Kamel wrongly thought the West would embrace him, and that the US would help make him the leader of Iraq.\n\n\"It was a very difficult time for me. I found myself stuck between two families, my father and brothers on one side, and my husband and children on the other,\" recalled Raghad who is putting her own version of the story across in a book she is currently writing.\n\nShe said her children hold no grudges whatsoever against her family for their role in their father's death.\n\n\"I know this is hard for a normal family to understand. But all families of rulers are not average people and sometimes it's hard to understand the complexity of their lives,\" she said, adding that her daughter, 30-year-old Harir Hussein Kamel, has written a yet unpublished book that delves into those complex family relations. \n\nAfter the defection and the death of Kamel, the relationship between Raghad and her father lost its \"luster\". \n\nIt was around the time of the invasion that their ties were strengthened as the family united to defend their rule.\n\n\"And till the last moment, my father remained satisfied, grateful and proud of me,\" she said.\n\nReturning home\n\nThe setting where Raghad last saw her father was a family gathering in his living room a few days before the invasion. He was sitting across from her asking the family to stay strong and to be prepared if their homes got bombed.\n\nThe first airstrike that the US launched in Iraq in 2003 hit Raghad's farmhouse, she said.\n\nShortly afterwards, she fled to Jordan, where she received sanctuary from the royal family. She never returned home, adapting to her new reality slowly and becoming preoccupied with the chores of daily life.\n\nRaghad lives a comfortable life in Jordan, spending a lot of time with her children and her friends, but said she longs for her home. She would want to return if Iraq entered \"a stage that is moderate and away from the obsession with hatred and revenge\".\n\n\"This Iraq is mine, my family's, my ancestors' -- It's everyone's Iraq. Why wouldn't I imagine returning? It would be very normal for me to return one day.\"\n\nAnd despite the seemingly never-ending cycle of violence, Raghad is hopeful about the future.\n\n\"What is happening is just a momentary state, a state of invasion and confusion. But this is not the fate of Iraq,\" she said. \n\n\"The war is not infinite. Of course, there is hope.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.00492906570435, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1461, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 16, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 23, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 8.195947396060001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 23, "mft_sum": 65, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.44900752908966, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 5.909090909090001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/26/us/five-things-monday-trnd/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 545, "scraper_regex": 585}}, "headline": "5 things for Monday, December 26, 2016: Russia plane crash, George Michael", "wordcount_as_scraped": 585, "date": "20161226130000", "story_content": "Good morning. Hope you had a great Christmas. Whether at home or back at work, here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.\n\n1. Russia plane crash\n\nA huge search is ongoing in the Black Sea after the crash of a Russian military plane. There were 92 people on board, but no one is thought to have survived. The Russian army's official choir was on the flight, headed to a New Year's performance in Syria. Weather doesn't seem to have been an issue in the crash, and officials have already ruled out terrorism. Russia is observing a national day of mourning.\n\n2. US-Israel relations\n\nBarack Obama has less than a month left in his term, so we guess he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu don't have to pretend anymore. Netanyahu blasted Obama's administration after the US didn't veto a UN Security Council resolution condemning Isreal's West Bank settlements. Netanyahu also called in the US ambassador for a tongue lashing. The president and prime minister have never been close, so the UN vote just brought all the bitterness out in the open.\n\n3. Natural disasters\n\nA super storm and a super quake marked Christmas Day in a couple of corners of the globe. Super Typhoon Nock-ten smacked the Philippines, forcing thousands to evacuate, closing ports and stranding 11,000 passengers. Meanwhile Chile was rocked by a magnitude 7.7 earthquake that was centered about 25 miles off its coast. There weren't any immediate reports of damage or injuries, but a tsunami warning was briefly issued.\n\n4. US executions\n\nExecutions in the US are at a 25-year low. There were just 20 executions this year, the lowest number since 1991. And just two states -- Texas and Georgia -- were responsible for 16 of those 20 executions. Support for the death penalty is dropping too. Less than half of Americans say they are in favor of it. But not everybody wants to get rid of it. Voters in Nebraska, California and Oklahoma defeated ballot measures seeking to abolish the death penalty.\n\n5. George Michael\n\n2016 will forever be remembered as the year we had to say goodbye to some of the 80s' biggest music icons: David Bowie, Prince and now George Michael. The former Wham! singer died of heart failure at 53. If you grew up in the 80s, his pop hits like \"Careless Whisper,\" \"Father Figure\" and \"Faith\" were the soundtrack of your times. But beyond the music, he also fought for causes he believed in, like raising money for AIDs research.\n\n        \n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nPeople are talking about these. Read up. Join in.\n\nPizza delivery\n\nHe's battling cancer. Then he won free pizza for a year. If anyone deserves to chow down, it would be him, right? Instead he gave it all to a local food bank.\n\nFound his forever family\n\nIf this photo doesn't warm your heart, you simply don't have one. 3-year-old foster kid Michael celebrated big time when he got adopted last week.\n\nOut of this world\n\nHere's something new to do in 2017: Have your laughter printed up by a 3D printer and then have it launched into outer space.\n\nHeaven help us\n\nIt was probably a service like no other when a church in Sri Lanka printed up the lyrics to Tupac's \"Hail Mary\" instead of the common Christian prayer.\n\nAND FINALLY ...\n\nHead slapper\n\nAll the puppy wants to do is take a nice little nap.

A direct hit on this rotten, poisonous pipeline.\n\nOnce I heard of the Army's statement, I hurried down the muddy entryway and headed to the main fire where hundreds had quickly gathered awaiting confirmation of the news. By 4 p.m., the Corps' decision was still just a rumor. There's hardly any cell phone service at camp, so people relied heavily on word of mouth.\n\n\"Is it true?\" one man said.\n\n\"I don't know,\" another replied.\n\nDave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, suddenly appeared from the back of the crowd, wearing his trademark hat and a small grin.\n\nArchambault made his way near the drum, grabbed a mic, and confirmed that, indeed, the black snake had been placed in a precarious position. Construction has stopped.\n\n\"Today is a moment in time we'll all remember,\" Archambault said to a crowd of hundreds. \"We prayed about this. Prayer and peace is what got us here.\" \n\nAnd he's right.\n\nFor months, unarmed Native Americans and allies gripping eagle feathers and sage have demonstrated against the construction of the pipeline that would threaten the Missouri River, the main water source for the Lakota people as well as 17 million others who live along the river.\n\nThese water protectors have put themselves at great bodily and emotional risk.\n\nTo date, they have been subjected to vicious dogs and rubber bullets and tear gas and water cannons in freezing temperatures. They've been thrown into dog kennels and strip-searched by police. \n\nBut all that is over -- at least for the moment.\n\nOur elder, Tom Goldtooth, said this is \"check, not checkmate.\"\n\nCome January 20, we'll have a new, pro-pipelines president. Donald Trump invested in the company building the Dakota Access Pipeline at one point and even talks about resurrecting the since-killed Keystone XL pipeline. \n\nSo, yeah, this battle isn't over by a long shot.\n\nMore pipelines threaten our mother earth.\n\nWe live in a country that has a suicidal addiction to oil and gas. We know more pipelines are slated for construction all over this country. We know pipes leak and pollute clean water. We also know treaties between Native Americans and the US are constantly at risk.\n\nSo, no, this isn't the last round.\n\nStill, after 524 years of aggressive oppression, as Native Americans we will take the victories that come our way. \n\nIn the meantime, we prepare for the incoming pro-pipelines president. His oil and gas agenda would leave Native Americans high dry, or at least knee-deep in tar sands puddles of sick water. And you'll be in it, too.\n\nWater is life, folks. Native Americans are resilient, and nonviolent action and prayer stopped the pipeline.\n\nFor now.\n\nHere comes Trump.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.73037552833557, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 520, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.749655568294, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.53846153846154, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/07/opinions/trump-us-last-stand-on-earth-maltby-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "America used to be the world's last safe refuge. Trump changed that", "wordcount_as_scraped": 830, "date": "20161107140000", "story_content": "My family has been indulging in memories lately.\n\nNot everyone gets invited to a 95th birthday party; nor are most such occasions, I suspect, as invigorating as the celebration I recently attended for my grandfather's boisterous cousin Marianne.\n\nMarianne is one of life's great survivors -- she's had to be. In a rare somber moment at our gathering, her sister recounted the night that her family fled its native Hungary, scrambling through the woodland border with Austria to escape the brutal repressions that followed a failed nationalist uprising in 1956.\n\nHer nephew, then a small child, still remembers crawling on his hands and knees through the darkness, Russian searchlights circling overhead.        \n\nThis week, as the world fixes its eyes on American democracy, Hungarians will be remembering that civic freedom, once lost, is not easily regained.\n\nIt is 60 years since street protests in Budapest blossomed into a fleeting, 10-day government of independence. A newly emboldened prime minister announced free elections and Hungary's departure from the Warsaw Pact, the military treaty entrenching Soviet dominance over the Eastern Bloc. \n\nBut on November 4, Soviet tanks once again invaded Budapest. By November 11, the last pockets of armed resistance had been gunned down. Reprisals began. As many as 200,000 Hungarians, my cousins among them, became refugees.\n\nThe quest for safe refuge wasn't new. Marianne set a course for London because my mother's father, her cousin and the close companion of her youth, had already settled here. Over the 20 years preceding, most of the family had already left Hungary, some fleeing Nazism; others communism. Half of my mother's family fled to America, others to Switzerland and Britain. Europe continued to lurch between political extremes. Those in America always felt a little bit safer.\n\nTen years ago, as a British student at Yale, I heard a fellow young conservative recite Ronald Reagan's great 1964 campaign speech for Barry Goldwater, \"A Time For Choosing.\" For Reagan, freedom in America was threatened by \"a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capital,\" a line which wouldn't be out of place from his nominally Republican successor, Donald Trump.\n\nBut unlike Trump, Reagan also recognized that American democracy manifested greatest in the beacon that it shone to the rest of us.\n\nIn this famous speech, Reagan repeats the words of a refugee from communism -- a Cuban, in this case, but he could easily have substituted a Hungarian. \"I had someplace to escape to,\" the Cuban reminds Americans. Reagan continued: \"If we lose freedom here, there is no place to escape to. This the last stand on earth.\"\n\nI have always known America as my last safe haven. Were Europe ever to be plunged into darkness, I could pack my bag as my forebears did before me, and make that final flight.\n\nI don't need to book passage just yet, though the rise of populism in Europe is worrisome. As Mr. Trump likes to remind us, Europe is no longer stable and life feels just that little bit more insecure.\n\nIn France, the twin extremes of Islamist apologism and fascist reaction grow ever more intertwined, like thorny weeds in a Grimm fairytale.\n\nIn Britain, it's hard not to be unnerved by the fratricidal discord unleashed by the recent Brexit referendum. It is only a few months since a young female Member of Parliament was gunned down at the height of the referendum campaign. \n\nRacist attacks are on the rise in Britain, and major tabloid newspapers have taken to harassing senior judges. (Three who ruled against the constitutional standing of the Brexit referendum this week have been labeled by the Daily Mail as \"ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE\"). But America stands on the brink of electing a man who has been endorsed by the KKK; who has implied a judge of Hispanic origin should be disqualified from the bench.\n\nTrump has threatened to jail Hillary Clinton, should he defeat her -- and worse. At a recent Trump rally, shouts of \"lock her up\" escalated into \"execute her.\"\n\nEuropean Jews feel particularly unnerved. No other minority has so depended on the prospect of America. And anti-semitism is back on the rise in Europe -- I've written about it, anxiously, myself. But journalists critiquing UK politicians don't receive images of themselves in the striped uniforms of Auschwitz inmates. Glimpse at Trump's support base, and no European Jew can any longer count America a safe refuge. That is the alt right's victory.\n\nIf Trump wins or loses on Tuesday, he has already achieved irreparable damage to America's standing across the globe. Many Americans know that, intellectually; what they may not feel, as we friends of America feel viscerally, is that America no longer offers hope.\n\nWhen I see Trump justify torture; impugn judges; advocate civil unrest, I don't see the ideal democracy that promised to keep the flame alive. In him, I see the petty dictators my grandparents ran from in Europe. Unlike them, I have no last stand on earth.

He was a staunch backer of the incoming president and could soon be in a position to shepherd many of Trump's biggest promises through Washington.\n\nThe secretary of commerce is responsible for promoting the nation's businesses and ensuring its markets run well. As part of this task, he or she oversees the country's international trade rules, one of Trump's most frequent targets. Although Ross has advocated for the Trans Pacific Partnership, a potential deal Trump has railed against, he has also signaled opposition to free trade deals in the past. In a CNN interview after Trump's selection, Ross said his first goal would be to renegotiate NAFTA.\n\nWhat makes Ross right for the job?\n\nHe is an industry veteran who knows the ins and outs of the world of finance and has had a bird's eye view of many industries Trump has spoken about, particularly coal and steel. He has swooped in and rescued these businesses and left them in a successful place. Moreover, his shift from the Democratic Party to the GOP suggests some bipartisan credibility. \n\nHis long standing opposition to some trade deals means he has had his finger on the same pulse currently animating the Trump coalition, as well as politicians on the other side of the aisle opposed to free trade agreements, like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAs one of the authors of Trump's economic plan, he could be among the most well poised to deliver to Trump's voters exactly what they asked for.\n\nWhat do Ross' critics say?\n\nRoss can easily be cast as a Wall Street robber baron. He once said on Bloomberg TV that \"the 1 percent is being picked on,\" and he was reportedly the \"Grand Swipe,\" or leader, of Kappa Beta Phi, a secret society on Wall Street. \n\nHis businesses have been forced to pay fines to the government several times, including as recently as August of 2016 to the SEC for failing to disclose fees his firm was charging. In 2013, he sat on the board of a company that agreed to pay over $2 billion in a settlement over its handling of subprime loans. \n\nAnd in 2006, 12 people died in an explosion a West Virginia mine his company purchased.\n\nAdditionally, Ross can be criticized for his closeness to Trump, both as a major donor to his campaign and as someone who personally helped Trump in business. In the 1990s, he helped Trump retain control of a failing casino in Atlantic City. \n\nFurther, with no experience in government and decades-long ties to Wall Street, critics point out his lack of qualifications to run a vast government agency and question if he would act on behalf of the people at large as opposed to the narrow interests of the financial sector. \n\nThe secretary of commerce also oversees the collection and distribution of information about the country, from the constitutionally-mandated census to the National Weather Service.\n\nWhat made Ross who he is?\n\nBorn in New Jersey and a graduate of both Yale and Harvard, Ross made his career on Wall Street. He worked as a bankruptcy adviser before starting his own firm, purchasing businesses in some industries Trump mentioned frequently on the campaign trail, including coal and steel. Through his efforts, Ross has amassed some $3 billion, although a Bloomberg analysis showed his more recent performance flagging.\n\nAsked by CNN's Erin Burnett if he represented the elite interests Trump promised to drive out of politics, Ross argued he did not because of his positive relationships with blue collar workers and unions.\n\n\"The fact that you're successful doesn't mean that you can't relate to working people,\" he said.\n\nWilbur Ross, Trump's commerce pick: Success \"doesn't mean that you can't relate to working people\" https://t.co/9uBk94yJg8\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) December 1, 2016\n\nAnything else?\n\nHe would be replacing another billionaire, Penny Pritzker, the current head of Commerce.\n\nIf confirmed, he would be the oldest person ever appointed to head the Commerce Department.\n\nRoss' nickname is the \"King of Bankruptcy,\" and Trump has repeatedly called himself the \"king of debt.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.14285719394684, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 643, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.2264306875700002, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 7, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.0886469673405899, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.636363636364}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/02/opinions/trump-rewrites-the-rules-naftali-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Trump will continue to rewrite the rules of presidency -- brace yourself", "wordcount_as_scraped": 764, "date": "20161202150000", "story_content": "In Cincinnati, Donald Trump said that others were comparing him to Andrew Jackson. Nearly two centuries ago, however, that same Andrew Jackson acknowledged that his famous self-confidence had limits. \"A diffidence, perhaps too just, in my own qualifications,\" he said in his first inaugural address, \"will teach me to look with reverence to the examples of public virtue left by my illustrious predecessors.\"\n\nNeither diffidence nor reverence was much on display at the President-elect's rally. \"The bottom line is,\" an exuberant Trump said to an equally exuberant crowd, \"We won, we won big.\"\n\nDonald Trump is changing the rites and rituals of the presidential transition, almost as much as he changed those of the primary season and the general election campaign.\n\nOn Thursday, he traveled to the industrial Midwest to trumpet a deal made by the state of Indiana, still controlled by his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence, to exchange $7 million in state subsidies (or tax expenditures) to save Carrier jobs and lead a huge \"USA Thank You 2016 Tour\" rally in Cincinnati. \n\nNo winner of either party has ever done anything of this sort before. As he prepared to enter office during the Great Recession, Barack Obama sought to calm citizens and markets by speaking out more often than any president-elect had before him.\n\nUntil Obama, presidents-elect had traditionally refrained from saying much of consequence -- besides announcing appointments -- during their transition.\n\nIndeed, even though he was entering during a period of even greater economic collapse in 1932 than faced by Obama seven decades later, President-elect Franklin Roosevelt turned down Herbert Hoover's request, as described by historian William E. Leuchtenburg, \"to collaborate on framing international economic policy\" and said very little.\n\nIn 2008, President-elect Obama not only broke the mold by speaking publicly a lot during his transition (he even issued likely the first Thanksgiving statement as president-elect) but he was the first president-elect to introduce precise plans, including outlining what would roughly become the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- the stimulus package -- almost two weeks before George W. Bush took his boots back to Texas.\n\nBut Trump's event was something qualitatively different. And it was not just that it was a political rally.\n\nIn promoting the Carrier deal, both the President-elect and his running mate acted as if the Trump administration had already begun. Even though only he, Pence, had any legal authority to negotiate with Carrier, the dutiful running mate ascribed the deal to Trump. \"Today in Indianapolis because of the bold leadership and vision of President-elect Donald Trump, a company that announced back in February that they were closing their doors and moving to Mexico, announced that now more than 1,100 jobs, good-paying jobs, will stay right here in America. And the President-elect made it happen.\"\n\nThe crowd went wild. And should the deal gain widespread public support, despite the costs to the Indiana Treasury, it is possible that this will not be the last deal made during the transition.\n\nThis rally was an historical outlier in other ways. Trump used it to remove any doubt that he has no intention of patching up his relationship with the country's media. He seemed to delight in ridiculing journalists for not predicting his victory. \n\nAt no time did he suggest that pollsters may have made honest mistakes or that he himself might have been surprised by his success on November 8. Instead, he enchanted his audience by suggesting a grandiose disinformation campaign by the entire US media to deprive his people of the truth of the ultimate success of his movement.\n\nAs he implied this grand claim, he dismissively swept his hand while pointing at the members of the media, off-camera but in front of his podium, calling them all \"dishonest.\"\n\nEqually unusual in a transition period was the reaction of the Ohio crowd, which roared as Trump threw them red meat. When one or more demonstrators started protesting Trump, like a Caesar deciding the fate of Christians in the forum, he signaled that they be ejected from the arena. \"They don't know that Hillary lost a couple of weeks ago,\" Trump said, smiling as the audience screamed its approval of the action of the bouncers.\n\nThe first president-elect to claim a policy achievement and throw himself a victory tour; Trump became the first to smear the entire Fourth Estate, eject a dissenter and ridicule the supporters of his opponent: all in one evening. We are in new territory or, as Trump himself said in Cincinnati, \"The script is not yet written; we do not know what the next page will read.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.11467889696359598, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 800, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.2081741457299997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202150000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.5, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/opinions/us-iran-immigration-hamid-dabashi/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [1766, 2111], "\u00e0": [1768]}}, "headline": "Iranians no strangers to a US ban, but Trump era is different", "wordcount_as_scraped": 844, "date": "20170126110000", "story_content": "Nuke Iran, Maim Iranians!\"  I can still hear the chants of undergraduate students marching down Locust Walk as they passed by McNeal Building on the University of Pennsylvania campus -- where the Department of Sociology was located in 1980 -- precisely at the moment when I was taking my grueling comprehensive MA exam.\n\nThis was during the Iran Hostage Crisis of 1979-1981 when US President Jimmy Carter was in office.  He had just singled out and ordered all of us Iranian students to report to immigration officers coming to our campus to prove we were here legally, be yet again fingerprinted and put against a wall in the Bennett Hall on the Penn campus and be photographed.  If anyone of us had \"violated\" the terms of our visas, we would be deported.\n\nPresident Carter also ordered no more visas to be issued to any Iranian students, which meant that if we left for Iran to visit our families or left even as far as Canada we risked not being allowed to come back to continue our education, which is precisely what happened in April 1980 when a group of Iranian students returning from Canada were detained at the US-Canada border.  A prominent Iranian filmmaker, Parviz Sayyad later made a movie about this incident called \"Checkpoint\" (1987).  \n\nWhile under this US visa restriction, I lost my mother in Iran in 1982, unable to go and see her before she passed away or to attend her funeral. \n\nThis visa restriction was issued by a Democratic President who I now have the deepest admiration for what he's done for the sick, the poor, and the homeless after his presidency -- and particularly for daring to utter the word \"apartheid\" about the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.    \n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?  \n\nAll these memories rushed back to me reading the news that \"US President Donald Trump is expected to sign executive orders . . . [imposing] a temporary ban on most refugees and a suspension of visas for citizens of Syria and six other Middle Eastern and African countries.\"  \n\nThe comparison goes only so far before it becomes a clich\u00e9 and prevents our more accurate reading of what is happening to my adopted homeland here in the US.  Trump is not Carter.  US diplomats are not held hostage by any militant band of revolutionaries anywhere in the world.  \n\nWe have an entirely different geopolitics today framing President Trump's executive orders.  \n\nOf the seven countries included in Mr. Trump's executive order -- Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen -- six of them (all except Iran) have been a target of US military operations over the last two decades.  Until very recently Iran too has been the subject of crippling economic sanctions.  \n\nBanning the citizens of these war-torn regions will not increase US national security.  Quite to the contrary. The xenophobic belligerence of the Trump administration singling out and indiscriminately targeting Muslims will in fact vastly increase the animus toward innocent Americans around the globe.  \n\nBut the security of Americans is farthest removed from the unfolding agenda of an administration that is now systematically targeting every single dimension of a civic life in the US -- from frightening disregard for environmental policies to ridicule of masses of millions of women protesting their vulnerability under a Trump demonstration. \n\nFrom immigrants to Americans  \n\nThe discriminatory and Islamophobic targeting of Muslims by banning them into the US, however, has also a strong domestic dimension to it.  This measure is not just to ban peaceful Muslims entering the US through the common and already stringent vetting that any other immigrant or refugee must follow.  This is to frighten, silence, and turn into second rate citizens millions of Muslim Americans right here in the US.  \n\nMr. Trump himself is on the record for considering Islam as hateful to Americans, while his national security adviser Michael Flynn believes Islam is a cancer.  \n\nThere are even talks of a \"Muslim registry\" or even internment of Muslims on the model of Americans of Japanese descent during World War II.  \n\nThe systematic targeting of Muslim is integral to Mr. Trump's xenophobic propaganda to divide and rule Americans by pitting them against each other. \n\nMy paramount feeling in 1979-1980, when targeted for discriminatory abuse by US officials, was fear and anger. But today my thoughts are exactly the opposite.  Today I am the father of four American children, born and raised in the United States, two of them in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and the other two in New York City.  \n\nI am neither angry, nor disappointed, nor frightened.  Quite to the contrary.  More than ever, I feel integral to the very fabric of American society. Every single one of us, from native Americans to the most recent immigrants from around the globe:  We are here to stay and to welcome generations of other hardworking, peaceful, law-abiding immigrants.  \n\nBy being integral to this national resistance to bigotry and racism we help rebuild the moral fabric of this country for posterity.  This is how immigrants become Americans:  supporting and defending the Constitution of the US \"against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.76271200180054, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 820, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.2777738867900004, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126110000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.39024390243902, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/opinions/france-new-racism-opinion-mondon/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [505, 3189, 5385, 7040, 7139], "\u00ef": [5381]}}, "headline": "France is paying the price for normalizing Islamophobia", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1280, "date": "20161121170000", "story_content": "Nicolas Sarkozy's defeat in the French Republican primary Sunday night could mean a reshuffling of priorities on the center right of French politics. \n\nThe race will now be between two former prime ministers, Alain Juppe and Francois Fillon, and the winner will then have to lead the mainstream right in what is set to be a decisive moment for France next year.\n\nFillon's decisive and surprising victory in the first round could demonstrate that Jupp\u00e9's more conciliatory tone has failed. With over 44% of the vote, Fillon may appear to many as a moderate compared to Sarkozy, but his neoliberal views -- coupled with a very conservative approach to societal matters, particularly with regard to identity, immigration and Islam -- should allow him to tap into the electorate of his defeated opponents. It was a strong sign that Sarkozy announced he would vote for Fillon as he conceded.\n\nAs France struggles to escape the woes of the global economic crisis, with growth failing to reach predictions and unemployment remaining high, much of the coverage of the campaign so far has given prominence to the far-right Front National party and its leader, Marine Le Pen.\n\nAfter shocking victories by pro-Brexit forces and US President-elect Donald Trump, Le Pen seems emboldened, and the media's willingness to follow her lead will without a doubt make immigration and Islam central to next year's campaign. This will be compounded by the governing Socialist Party's failure to reject the politics of identity.\n\nThis shift towards fantasies of a pure French (even Gaulish) identity being threatened has been made more prominent by recent attacks, as terrorists have fueled a deep sense of insecurity and distrust within the French population.\n\nThis toxic atmosphere has been compounded and normalized by politicians reacting disproportionately to the attacks, calling for war against enemies from without and within. \n\nStance on burkini bans\n\nThe burkini bans this summer exemplified the lack of an alternative -- beyond stigmatization and exclusion -- that politicians are willing to put forward in France.\n\nAfter being implemented in 31 towns, the bans on modest swimsuits worn by Muslim women were eventually suspended by the State Council, who claimed that such laws \"constituted a serious and manifestly illegal infringement of fundamental liberties.\" The council also reminded mayors that the law \"may only restrict freedoms if there are confirmed risks,\" something which clearly was not the case.\n\nDespite such strong advice, and a similar condemnation by the UN Human Rights high commissioner, politicians on both the left and right have jockeyed to show who is toughest when it comes to legislating over the rights of women's bodies, particularly those from already stigmatized minorities. Sarkozy went the furthest, demanding that the constitution be changed to ban the swimsuits.\n\nFillon offered his support to the mayors who had passed burkini-ban laws, while Prime Minister Manuel Valls continued to criticise the burkini, stating that wilfully vilifying that piece of clothing was in no way attacking personal freedom. \n\nJupp\u00e9 took a more moderate approach, criticizing the law and the polemics surrounding it. His efforts to appease tensions may have reassured left-wing voters, but they failed to win over his own camp.\n\nFollowing public opinion?\n\nSuch extreme reactions have not been targeting only the Muslim communities in France. They also have been aimed at migrants, as the recent debate over an infamous Calais migrant camp demonstrated. \n\nIn all cases, politicians defended their tough anti-immigrant stance on the basis that that they were merely following public opinion.\n\nHowever, a recent survey by Eurobarometer suggests this is not the case. When asked, \"What do you think are the two most important issues facing France at the moment?\" respondents ranked unemployment first (51.8%), followed by terrorism (30%, up from 13% in 2015). Immigration came fourth with 13.7%. \n\nWhen the same respondents were asked \"And personally, what are the two most important issues you are facing at the moment?\" rising prices/inflation came first (32.5%), followed by pensions (15.1%), taxation (14.4%) and unemployment (14%). Terrorism (7.2%) and immigration (3.8%) were respectively 13th and 15th.\n\nPaying the price \n\nThe hype created around such hot topics by the media and politicians does not only distract the electorate from other concerns. It also legitimizes a type of discourse that had long been marginalized. In France, this race to the bottom within the mainstream has allowed Le Pen and the Front National to take the back seat. At the FN summer conference, Le Pen posited herself as the \"normal\" candidate, more moderate than many of her mainstream counterparts.\n\nHowever, it would be wrong to assume that this normalization of Islamophobia in France is simply the result of a panicked reaction from politicians following deeply traumatic events. The recent explosion of Islamophobia in mainstream political discourse is the result of decades of stigmatization towards Muslim communities in France, starting with the hijab affair in the late 1980s.\n\nThe rise of simplistic exclusionary speech towards a diverse part of the population has been in part facilitated by the conscious misuses of the term la\u00efcit\u00e9. The word has traditionally protected freedom of religion while preventing interference from the state. But politicians have twisted its connotations into a tool for general stigmatization and exclusion.\n\nIslam has become the perfect scapegoat for French politicians who claim Muslims' incompatibility with \"our\" ways -- no matter how unclear these are -- became no longer a question of race but of culture and religion. But the end point is similar, and what has been called \"new racism\" is in fact very much still racism.\n\nAs I have explained at length elsewhere, \"Muslimness\" in this \"new racism\" is defined by the onlooker in a position of power, not the bearer of the identity, and is imposed onto people through generalization, misperception and stigmatization made ubiquitous by public discourse and repetition.\n\nSexism, violence and other generalizations become problems described as being located within the so-called \"Muslim community.\" This in turn justifies subjugating a minority to special and often violent treatment. And it prevents us from looking at the more systemic shortcomings of our societies in terms of gender violence and other forms of inequality and injustice.\n\nDystopia as the new norm?\n\nSuch a diversion has proven a blessing for mainstream politicians as they have failed to offer their people (including the minorities they willfully stigmatize) more hopeful avenues for politics. Dystopia has become the new norm.\n\nWith less than six months to go before the first round of the French presidential election, it seems that none of the mainstream candidates are willing to denounce Islamophobia in all its forms. While Jupp\u00e9 has taken a more conciliatory approach, his underwhelming performance in the first round of the R\u00e9publicans' primaries could spur a tougher approach in the coming week.\n\nWhile the situation is particularly worrying for minorities in France, polls revealing incredible levels of political dissatisfaction could point to a different future (up to 9 out of 10 respondents to the Eurobarometer survey say they don't trust political parties). While Brexit and Trump's successful campaigns did indeed capitalize on far-right sentiments, both did little to sufficiently address the more important economic issues that concern the electorate.\n\nWhile the far right has so far managed to tap into this resentment most successfully, at least in appearance, a progressive and inclusive alternative could turn the tide, as mainstream parties have proven their inability to retain or win back voters even when faced with an unpalatable alternative.\n\nThe question for the French people who believe in a different future than that offered by the FN is thus both simple and impossibly complicated: Can they wait for traditional parties to provide such an alternative, or should they take matters into their own hands?

Vallum feared reprisals from other Latin Kings members if they found out he was in a consensual sexual relationship with a transgender woman, the Justice Department said, citing statements Vallum made as part of his guilty plea.\n\nAfter luring the 17-year-old into his car under false pretenses, he assaulted her and stabbed her with a pocket knife. As she tried to flee he stabbed her repeatedly and used a hammer to deliver the deadly blows, the Justice Department said.\n\nVallum initially claimed he killed Williamson in a panic after learning she was transgender. In his guilty plea Wednesday, he admitted to lying about the circumstances surrounding her death.\n\nHe would not have killed Williamson if she was not transgender, he admitted in his plea.\n\nVallum previously pleaded guilty in state court to murdering Williamson in George County, Mississippi, and was sentenced to life in prison. Because Mississippi does not have a statute that protects people from bias crimes based on gender identity, the federal government was able to bring federal hate crime charges.\n\nA disheartening landmark\n\nThe prosecution drew mixed reaction from civil rights groups. \n\nDespite the circumstances, many lauded the prosecution, saying it sets an important precedent for using hate crime laws to protect gender identity. \n\n\"It sends a message, especially to the LGBT community, that the federal government will use this law when they are victims of crime,\" said Richard Saenz, staff attorney for Lambda Legal. \"For too long LGBT people have been ignored and violence against them has been ignored and they've felt that crimes against them will never be taken seriously.\"\n\nStill, it's a disheartening milestone, one that's based in problems that laws alone can't fix. \n\n\"It is important to note that our criminal justice system needs reform, and that simply adding new statutes that add to our already over-large prison population is insufficient to get at the root of the problem,\" said Jillian Weiss, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund. \n\n\"We must come together in our schools and churches and government halls to teach that prejudice is unacceptable.\" \n\nOthers said it would do nothing to prevent future crimes. \n\n\"Enhanced sentencing does not bring about the core values and educational shift needed at interpersonal and community levels to address gender identity-based violence. More efficient interventions may include community-created safety alternatives and restorative processes,\" said Flor Bermudez with the Transgender Law Center's Detention Project.\n\n\"Hate crime laws do nothing to ensure the safety of transgender people, since they don't address the root cause of the problem.  To the contrary, hate crime laws use criminalization and enhanced punishment in a way that ultimately only expand the criminal system that already disproportionately targets transgender women of color. \"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -11.093247413635302, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 579, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.7242407388700003, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222060000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 5.35405872193437, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/health/iraq-veteran-marine-walk-trnd/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 632, "scraper_regex": 678}}, "headline": "An Iraq war veteran walks 5,800 miles to spread a powerful message", "wordcount_as_scraped": 678, "date": "20161206140000", "story_content": "His road has been long and, at times, lonely.\n\nHe had to take it. \n\nHe was a combat veteran who had simply seen too much -- too many brother Marines dead on the battlefield in Iraq. When he came home he faced fresh battles: alcohol, arrests and a suicide attempt.\n\nHe chose a date that resonated -- and on September 11, 2015, Jonathan Hancock set out to prove that hurt would no longer define him. \n\nCarrying 70 pounds of gear, he hit the road to walk 5,800 miles from Maryland to California and many backroads in between. He was searching for hope and healing. \n\n\"On a cross-country journey like this, you pitch a tent when you can,\" Hancock told CNN's John Vause. \"I gotta be honest, there's some trespassing along the way, so you have to keep a low profile. I did pick up a hotel a couple times month to shower and clean up a bit.\"\n\nSnakebites and poison oak\n\nAlong the way, he got poison oak in California, impetigo in Georgia and snake bites in South Dakota and Louisiana. \n\nHancock was forced to climb a tree in Montana to avoid a moose, ran into a white wolf in the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming and was stalked by a mountain lion for three days in Oregon.\n\n\"That really sucks when you can see it follow you down the road,\" he said.\n\nHe endured all of this for three reasons, he said. He did it for self-healing, to visit fellow Marines and Gold Star families of the fallen -- and to spread awareness about what it's like for a war fighter to come home.\n\n\"I had to lay myself on the altar of humility,\" Hancock said. \"I wanted to show my brothers that it's okay to feel those feelings of darkness. And it's really okay to talk about them. That's such a higher purpose and transcends more than just my unit.\"\n\nHancock fought with the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment -- nicknamed The Magnificent Bastards -- in the first Battle of Ramadi in 2004. \n\nThe unit suffered the highest casualty rate in the Iraq War out of any single infantry battalion with 20% of the entire 1,000-man force killed or wounded, according to the U.S. Marine Corps. For many the battle hasn't ended. Hancock's marathon trek to honor their continuing struggle now is being turned into a documentary called \"Bastard's Road.\"\n\nHealing deep wounds\n\nHancock says 25-30% of his unit endures post-traumatic stress disorder and at least seven have committed suicide. \"Not a man from Ramadi comes home and doesn't feel something,\" he said.\n\nHancock hopes his walk and his brotherhood can help heal some very deep wounds.\n\n\"There's been tears and there's been lots of hugs and reassurances that we're gonna be there for each other,\" Hancock said. \"You speak about bad things and the memories that you hold dear to yourself and things you don't share with your families. So you share them with each other.\" \n\nHancock also knocked on the doors of Gold Star families.\n\n\"Their sons never came home and so to see a man who knew their sons or knew of their sons,\" Hancock said, \"I imagine that they would see their son walking home. It was tough for them and it was tough for me because you have to share in that emotion and grief. \n\n\"I wondered if I was strong enough to take that feeling on -- over the course of time, I realized that I was and I should continue to do this.\"\n\nNow, almost 6,000 miles later, with feet that look like a \"prehistoric river bed,\" Hancock's walk is nearing an end. On December 12, he'll walk into Camp Pendleton in southern California. This time he'll be far from alone. Many brothers in arms from his old battalion will be there to guide him through the gates.\n\nThey'll do so knowing that the United States is again in combat in Iraq.

A giant red heart now blocks any view of the swastika. \n\n\"A beautiful heart!\" she exclaims, waving her stained fingers in delight. \n\nSchramm is on a mission to rid the world of neo-Nazi and racist graffiti, one spray-painted heart at a time.\u00a0She calls herself a \"Polit-Putze\" -- a political cleaner. \u00a0Her tools: a can of red spray paint, nail polish remover and a scraper that she carries in a cloth bag with the hand-painted words \"Anti-Nazi.\"\u00a0\n\n\"I'm really concerned by this hate propaganda.

Well, I don't want to wait for someone else to do something about it.\"\n\nScrubbing away hate\n\nIt started more than 30 years ago when she saw a flyer supporting convicted Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess plastered to her neighborhood bus stop. It was still there when she returned from work. Disgusted, she took out her house keys and scratched it off. \n\n\"I just scrubbed the hate away until it was all gone,\" she says with a smile, \"It was a fantastic feeling afterwards. This mind pollution was gone!\"\n\nSince then, Schramm has developed a kind of sixth sense for where neo-Nazi material may be lurking. Train stations are a favorite hunting ground.\u00a0So are supermarket parking lots and playgrounds.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe has traveled across Germany and six other countries on this quest, and can spend up to 17 hours on the \"hunt\" a few days each week. She estimates that, over the years, she has removed or painted over more than 130,000 signs and stickers.\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nGermany's Institute of Human Rights has cataloged more than 10,000 hate crimes in 2015, a jump of 77% from the previous year. Far-right groups have capitalized on public fear and suspicion of refugees and migrants, in particular, after Germany accepted more than 890,000 asylum seekers last year. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSchramm says she can see that change on the streets. Anti-refugee stickers especially, she says, are easy to slap on to any street sign anonymously.\u00a0\n\n\"The threshold on the misuse of freedom of speech has deteriorated over the last few years. I think it has now reached rock bottom,\" she says. \"People tell me I am intolerant, that I don't respect the far-right's freedom of speech. But I say:\u00a0Freedom of speech has limits.\u00a0It ends where hatred and contempt for humanity begins.\"\u00a0\n\n'Schramm, we're coming to get you'\n\nAt home, Schramm shows us her catalog of neo-Nazi graffiti, including a 1989 photo of a young man blocking her path and giving her a Nazi salute. The language may have changed but the message remains the same. \u00a0\n\nIn the 80s, crude caricatures of Jews and Africans coupled with Nazi slogans to \"remove\" them. From the 90s, she has photos of \"Turks out!\" scrawled across train station walls coupled with swastikas. \n\nToday, she says, she finds anti-Muslim graffiti along with coded neo-Nazi rhetoric. She shows us a photo of a graffitied number\u00a0\"88\" which stands for \"HH\" or \"Heil Hitler\" -- H being the 8th letter in the alphabet. \u00a0\n\nHer relentless drive has landed her on a \"most-wanted\" list of a neo-Nazi group and she has received plenty of violent threats. She's even come across a large graffiti sign that read \"Schramm, we're coming to get you.\" \u00a0\n\nPolice have told Schramm not to provoke attacks with her mission and are often bemused by this 70-year-old woman brandishing a can of spray paint. \u00a0Usually, she's let off with a gentle warning but for the first time in October, she was threatened with a \u20ac1,800 euro fine (around $1,875) for defacing public property if she continues her unconventional hobby.\n\nFacing the populist wave head-on\n\nIn the East German town of Bautzen -- the scene of repeated brawls between refugees and residents -- she found graffiti that read: \"Democracy = Death to the People.\"\u00a0\n\nOnce Schramm got her hands on it, the text became \"Democracy Loves the People.\" But when an off-duty police officer caught her in the act, he threatened to put her in jail overnight.\n\n\"I told him: Go ahead,\" she laughs, \"I need the holiday!\" \u00a0\n\nShe acknowledges that with Germany's far-right movement growing alongside suspicion of refugees, she may never see an end to her war on neo-Nazi and racist graffiti.\u00a0But she has no plans to slow down. \u00a0\n\n\"I've just always felt: If you don't do it yourself, it just won't get done.\" ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.36267232894897, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 777, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.1642044068100001, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161217110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.2870012870012901, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/21/europe/turkey-russia-ambassador-killed/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1009, "scraper_regex": 1205}}, "headline": "Ambassador shooting: Russia pushes back on Turkey's Gulenist claim", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1205, "date": "20161221150000", "story_content": "The Kremlin has pushed back against Turkey's allegations that a movement led by exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen was behind the assassination of Russia's ambassador to Ankara.\n\n\"We need to wait for results of a joint investigative group. You shouldn't be in a rush to make conclusions until the investigation identifies who was behind the murder of our ambassador,\" Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said Wednesday.\n\nRussian and Turkish investigators are trying to learn more about the assassination of Russian ambassador Andrey Karlov, who was gunned down Monday evening while speaking at the opening of an art exhibit in Turkey's capital. \n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that there are \"leads regarding the foreign connections\" of the shooter, who has been identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas.\n\n\"The FETO connection of Russian Ambassador Karlov's assassin is obvious. He is a member of FETO; there is no need to hide this,\" Erdogan said on Turkish television, using the shorthand name for Fethullah Terrorist Organization, which is what the Turkish government calls Gulen's movement. \n\nGulen, a former ally and current rival of Erdogan, has been in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. He leads a popular movement called Hizmet, which includes hundreds of schools, hospitals and relief agencies. \n\nBut Turkey's government accuses the movement of being behind a failed coup in July -- an allegation Gulen denies. Ankara has demanded that the United States extradite the cleric.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin will delay his annual news conference in order to pay his respects to the slain ambassador, whose funeral will be held Thursday, Russian state-run news agency Sputnik reported. \n\nShooter: 'Don't forget Aleppo!'\n\nPolice say Altintas was the 22-year-old Turkish police officer standing behind Karlov while the ambassador was speaking at the Cagdas Sanat Merkezi modern arts center in Ankara. \n\nAltintas, dressed in a dark suit and tie, fired several shots at Karlov, shouting, \"God is greatest! Do not forget Aleppo! Do not forget Syria! Do not forget Aleppo! Do not forget Syria!\" \n\nWhat do we know about the assassin?\n\nTurkish security forces eventually killed Altintas, Turkey's Interior Ministry said.\n\nAltintas was not on police duty at the time, having taken sick leave Monday, Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported. Investigators are checking whether he'd had any connection with Russian Embassy staff, according to Anadolu.\n\nOfficials with Ankara's Cankaya district, which operates the art center, said Wednesday that Altintas bypassed an X-ray machine at the center by showing his police identification. As a police officer, Altintas would have been permitted to carry a firearm at all times. \n\n\"It was found out that the attacker was warned by the security staff when he didn't go through the X-ray, and upon this (the attacker) entered by showing his official police ID,\" the district's council said.\n\n12 people detained\n\nTurkish authorities have detained 12 people in the investigation of Monday's shooting, Anadolu reported Wednesday.\n\n Anadolu also reported that books about al Qaeda and Gulen's movement were found after a search of Altintas' home. \n\nThe 12 detainees include a man who police say led a network affiliated with Gulen at the Izmir-based Rustu Unsal Police Academy, from which Altintas graduated, Anadolu reported.\n\nThe detainees also include Altintas' parents, his sister, two other relatives, his roommate, an unidentified suspect and four police officers who were hired during the same term as Altintas, according to Anadolu.\n\nOpinion: An acrid whiff of 1914?\n\nA 13th person, Altintas' uncle, was released under \"judicial control,\" or bail-like conditions, Anadolu quoted security sources as saying. \n\nAccording to Anadolu, the uncle was a former senior executive at a private school connected with Gulen. The school was shut down after the July coup attempt.\n\nUnderstanding Turkey's deadly catalog of enemies\n\nThe failed coup triggered a wave of arrests and detentions of those suspected of any involvement. Turkey also suspended or dismissed tens of thousands of people in various institutions who were perceived as being opposed to the government. \n\nThat included the suspensions of more than 12,000 police officers who were accused of having links to Gulen.\n\nPutin: Shooting tried to undermine Russia-Turkey relations\n\nPutin said Karlov's killing was a clear provocation aimed at undermining not just the normalization of Russian-Turkish relations but also a \"peace process in Syria\" promoted by Russia, Turkey, Iran and other countries.\n\n\"The only response we should offer to this murder is stepping up our fight against terror, and the criminals will feel the heat,\" Putin said in televised remarks. An 18-strong investigative team of Russia's special agencies arrived in Turkey to help authorities with their inquiries.\n\nThe Ankara Police Department has devoted 120 people, including anti-terror personnel and interpreters, to work with the Russian team, Anadolu reported.\n\nErdogan echoed Putin's sentiments, saying, \"The Russian government and the Turkish republic have the will to not fall into that provocation.\"\n\nKarlov's assassination came at a time of improving relations between the two countries, which hit an all-time low after Turkish forces shot a Russian warplane out of the sky near the Syrian border in November 2015.\n\nRussia slapped a raft of sanctions on Turkey after the deadly incident, hurting Turkish exports and damaging its tourism industry.\n\nThe relationship began to thaw in June when Erdogan wrote a letter expressing \"regret\" to the dead pilot's family. After Erdogan faced down the attempted military coup in July, Putin was among the first world leaders to call and offer his support.\n\nKarlov's body arrived in Moscow late Tuesday. The ambassador was honored at a ceremony attended by Russia's foreign minister, the Turkish foreign minister and Karlov's widow, according to Russia's Foreign Ministry.\n\nRoles of Russia and Turkey in Syria\n\nAleppo is the northern Syrian city that has been contested between rebels and Syrian government forces in the country's years-long civil war. Russia, the most powerful ally of the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, began airstrikes in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria last year to prop up the embattled leader.\n\nThe Syrian regime is on the verge of retaking all of Aleppo from rebel groups who have controlled parts of the city since 2012. Moscow has carried out airstrikes since September 2015 to prop up Assad. \n\nHuman rights groups and other countries have denounced Russia over its backing of the Syrian leader. \n\nAs one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia has used its veto powers to block certain proposed political solutions to end the war.\n\nThe bombardment in Syria has drawn criticism from Western powers, with President Barack Obama last week accusing Russia of slaughtering civilians in Aleppo in concert with the Assad regime. Moscow has recently tried to distance itself from the assault in eastern Aleppo.\n\nTurkey's involvement in Syria is complicated. On one hand, the Turks are eager to help eradicate ISIS. On the other, Ankara is opposed to a group of Kurdish fighters battling ISIS inside Syria, saying those Kurds are linked to Turkey's own Kurdish insurgents -- the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which Turkey has been fighting for years.\n\nTurkey fears that an entrenched Kurdish area in Syria would fuel momentum for an independent Kurdish state that could claim Turkish territory. \n\nMeanwhile, the United States supports Kurdish groups in both Syria and Iraq as critical partners in the battle against ISIS.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.1803884506225595, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 1, "wordcount": 1009, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 9, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.3327823236, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.56788899900892, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/finding-your-fairy-tale-eprise-profile/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1110, "scraper_regex": 1237}}, "headline": "Real survivors get fairy-tale endings", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1237, "date": "20170112100000", "story_content": "He seemed like such a nice man, the clean-cut 25-year old who visited a rural Wisconsin church one autumn morning in 1996, looking for a wife.\n\nBy the end of the service, he'd set his sights on Misti Hawn, a pretty, auburn-haired 18-year-old who attended the fundamentalist Christian church with her parents and 11 younger brothers and sisters.\n\nThat very day, he asked Hawn's father for permission to begin a formal courtship, and he said yes. Two months later, while sitting around the dining room table, the visitor surprised everyone, including Hawn, by asking for her hand in marriage.\n\n\"My dad said OK, and they shook hands on it, and it was a done deal,\" Hawn remembered.\n\nDisagreeing was not an option.\n\nHawn's new husband was not as kind as he had seemed during the courtship. It started out as emotional abuse, and then, four years into the marriage, he started drinking and began to beat and rape her. Taught that a woman must obey her husband, Hawn blamed herself for her mistreatment and stayed in the marriage for 10 more years.\n\nThen, all alone, Hawn had to find a way to financially support herself and her six children, then 3 to 13. She had to psychologically heal herself and the kids, especially her oldest daughter, who, unbeknownst to Hawn, had been sexually abused by her father.\n\nHere's what didn't help her: therapy.\n\nHere's what did help: dressing up like Little Red Riding Hood.\n\n'Happily ever after is still possible'\n\n\"Finding your Fairytale\" is the brainchild of Hawn's friend Angie Kupper, a therapist who works with children and teens with anxiety disorders and depression.\n\nLast year, she gathered Hawn and 11 others to pose for a calendar, each of them dressed as a character from fairy tales and other stories, to signify a struggle they'd endured.\n\nJulie Mundt has obsessive-compulsive disorder, which forces her to clean uncontrollably. She dressed as Cinderella, scrubbing floors.\n\nErica Retzlaff, who fell down the rabbit hole of heroin addiction and found herself trapped in a dark and dangerous place, portrayed Alice in Wonderland.\n\nHawn, in a red cape and boots, is deceived by the Big Bad Wolf.\n\nAll of them -- with hair, makeup and costumes that would make Walt Disney proud -- posed twice, once for a \"struggle\" photo and then for a \"victory\" photo.\n\nIn the victory photos, Cinderella stands triumphantly, no longer a slave to her disorder. Alice escapes the rabbit hole. Little Red Riding Hood escapes from the Big Bad Wolf.\n\nKupper made the calendar, and is making a related documentary, because she wants people who have faced tremendous challenges to realize that they don't have to live in pain forever.\n\n\"We all have our struggles, but happily ever after is still possible,\" she said.\n\nKupper wishes her own mother could have seen her future differently. She committed suicide when Kupper was 17.\n\n\"If we lose hope for happily ever after, I'm really scared for the decisions that we might make, like my mom did,\" she said. \"She no longer saw that magic or that hope for herself, and she ended her story.\n\nHappily ever after is a state of mind, she says. \"It's accepting your story and every chapter in it, and recognizing that happiness is still possible and it's worth fighting for.\"\n\nWhy dressing as a fairy-tale character can be therapeutic\n\n\"This is so clever!\" said Dr. Charles Raison, a psychiatrist at the University of Wisconsin, when he saw the \"Finding Your Fairytale\" Kickstarter page. \"I might rip this off!\"\n\nRaison said striking parallels between fairy-tale and real-life struggles could help his patients find healing. For example, he might ask a patient with obsessive-compulsive disorder to imagine herself as Cinderella.\n\n\"Cinderella is cleaning all the time because she's forced to by her stepmother,\" he said. \"When someone has OCD, their brains are forcing them to clean all the time even though don't actually want to.\"\n\nThen he would ask the patient to imagine herself with Cinderella's fairy-tale ending.\n\n\"OCD is hard to handle by yourself. You've got to have a fairy godmother to give you tools,\" he said. \"But then, when you're locked up in the basement when the prince arrives, you've got to fight for yourself. Cinderella doesn't just roll over and think the fairy godmother is going to show up twice.\"\n\nHistory has showed that imagery can be a powerful force for change. Raison points to ancient peoples, such as yogis in Tibet, who visualized themselves as deities to improve their self-image and achieve enlightenment.\n\n\"We're such word-dominated animals that we think everything can be put into words, but as you visualize yourself in some sort of fairy tale, you're engaging other senses around you,\" he said.\n\nAnd pretending to be someone else who has faced your struggle gets you out of your own head.\n\n\"If I've got this horrible OCD, it's all me, me, me, Chuck Raison,\" he said. \"But now if I'm Cinderella -- I guess I'd have to be Cinderella in drag -- it's not just me. I've connected it to an archetypal struggle.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood's silent scream\n\nIn her car on the way to the calendar shoot, Hawn almost turned around.\n\n\"In order for me to fully personify Little Red Riding Hood being terrified by the wolf, I knew I'd have to put myself back in the situation that I'd left,\" she said.\n\nShe regained her strength and kept driving.\n\nAs Hawn posed for the \"struggle\" photo, she was so scared, she was shaking. She let out screams.\n\nThen she decided to give a silent scream, just as she had for 10 years as a victim: pretending everything was all right and silently screaming for help from friends and family that never came. That was the winner.\n\nHawn took a few minutes to compose herself and then posed for the \"victory\" shot, a Red Riding Hood who has escaped the Big Bad Wolf.\n\nShe said she hopes that photo will help change the narrative of domestic abuse.\n\n\"All we see on the news is pictures of women all beat up, and there's no hope in those pictures, just sadness and pain,\" she said. \"We never hear about the afterwards, about women who managed to make lives for themselves.\"\n\nHawn made a life for herself and her six children by working hard over the past five years, cleaning houses, clerking in a grocery story and assisting a car mechanic.\n\nShe's now an insurance agent and a bartender, and her children, ages 8 to 18, are doing well.\n\nHer ex-husband served time in prison for sexually assaulting their daughter and was required to join the Wisconsin Sex Offender Registry.\n\nDrugs to treat depression, panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder allowed her to function for several years after she left him. But posing as Red Riding Hood did something different: It allowed her to actually see herself differently.\n\n\"Everyone keeps telling me I'm such a strong woman, and they're so proud of me, but inside, I felt like a weak woman who stayed longer than she should have,\" Hawn said. \"Finally I can now see the strong, confident woman that others see.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't wish what happened to me to happen to anyone else, but it made me who I am today, and I like who I am today,\" she said. \"You can come out the other side and have your own happily ever after.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.34493672847748, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1110, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 7, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.8719216361699997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 6, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170112100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.5225225225225203, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/11/europe/turkey-violence/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 941, "scraper_regex": 1290}}, "headline": "Timeline: Turkey's bloody year ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1290, "date": "20161211110000", "story_content": "In one of the most terror-scarred countries in the world, not even New Year's Day was safe from an attack.\n\nJust an hour after the new year began, a gunman shot his way into a popular high-end nightclub in Istanbul, killing at least 35 people. Scores more were wounded. \n\nThe attack was the latest in a wave of deadly violence that has killed people in different parts of Turkey throughout the past 365 days.\n\n2016 was a violent year for Turkey. There were suicide blasts claimed by ISIS and running battles between government forces and outlawed Kurdish PKK militants. A failed coup sparked a wide-ranging crackdown on alleged coup plotters. And the Russian ambassador was gunned down by a man shouting about the Syrian city of Aleppo. \n\nBelow are some of the major attacks that occurred this year:\n\nDecember 20: Assassination of top Russian diplomat\n\nA gunman shouting \"Do not forget Aleppo!\" assassinated Russia's ambassador to Turkey at an Ankara art gallery in what leaders of Russia and Turkey called a provocative terror attack.\n\nThe gunman, identified as police officer Mevlut Mert Altintas, was killed in the attack on Ambassador Andrey Karlov, according to various news organizations including Reuters.\n\nDecember 17: Attack on soldiers in Kayseri\n\nA car bomb exploded near a public bus, killing 13 soldiers and wounding 55 people, Turkey's state-run Anadolu agency reported. \n\nThe blast happened near Erciyes University in the central province of Kayseri and some civilians might have been wounded, Anadolu said.\n\nDecember 10: Twin bombings in Istanbul\n\nA Kurdish militant group claimed responsibility for twin bombings in Istanbul that killed at least 44 people, mostly police officers, and wounded 155 others.\n\nThe explosions, one large blast followed by a smaller one, occurred about 11 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET) after a heavily attended soccer game at Besiktas Vodafone Arena.\n\nThe Kurdish Freedom Hawks (TAK), a breakaway group of the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), said in a statement on its website that the Turkish people were not the target of the attack.\n\nNovember 4: The Diyarbakir bombing\n\nA car bomb targeting a police station in southeastern Turkey killed seven civilians and two police officers. It also injured over 100 people.\n\nISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in Diyarbakir, according to a statement circulated online by the ISIS-affiliated Amaq agency.\n\nOctober 9: 'Suicide rush' near Iraqi border\n\nA bomb exploded outside a police station in the Semdinli district of Hakkari Province -- about  48 miles from the Iraqi border -- killing at least 18 people. \n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said eight civilians died and 10 soldiers were killed in the attack, in which a pickup truck laden with about five tons of explosives made a \"suicide rush\" at a checkpoint outside the station. The PKK claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe US condemned the bombing \"in the strongest terms\".\n\nSeptember 12: Car bomb near government offices\n\nSuspected Kurdish militants detonated a car bomb near local government offices in the southeastern city of Van, wounding at least 50 people. \n\nThe blast hit some 200 meters from the Van provincial governor's office. It occurred a day after two dozen mayors from Kurdish-run municipalities were stripped of their office.\n\nAugust 21: The bloody wedding\n\nA suspected suicide bomber detonated explosives at a wedding party in the southeastern city of Gaziantep, killing at least 53 people and injuring about 100. The Turkish president blamed ISIS for the attack.\n\nAugust 18: Three bombings in the east\n\nThree bomb attacks targeting Turkish security forces in the east of the country killed 12 people and wounded nearly 300 others.\n\nBlasts at police stations in Van and Elazig killed four police officers and two civilians, reports said.\n\nIn Bitlis province, five soldiers died when their vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb in the village of Gayda. In nearby Nazar, a village guard was killed and a soldier wounded in clashes between security forces and PKK militants.\n\nTurkish officials blame the PKK for all three attacks.\n\nJuly 15: The failed coup\n\nAn attempted military coup in Turkey left at least 290 people dead and over 1,400 injured in a chaotic night of violence. Since then, tens of thousands of people have been arrested in the crackdown on individuals suspected of having ties to alleged coup plotters.\n\nRelated: What you need to know about the failed coup\n\nJune 28: Ataturk Airport attack\n\nThree assailants killed at least 36 people and injured scores of others in a gun and suicide bombing attack at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. An additional 147 people were wounded.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Turkish officials blamed ISIS for the attack.\n\nJune 8: Car bomb in Midyat\n\nThree people were killed by a car bomb in the southeastern Turkish town of Midyat -- the second such attack on Turkish police targets in two days.\n\nJune 7: 11 killed in Istanbul\n\nA car bomb attack targeting a police bus killed 11 people in Istanbul, Anadolu reported, citing police officials.\n\nThe blast, in the Beyazit neighborhood of Istanbul's historic Fatih district, occurred during morning rush hour. It killed seven police officers and four civilians and left 36 people injured, three of them critically, authorities said. Four people were detained.\n\nMarch 31:  7 police officers slain\n\nSeven police officers died and at least 27 more people were wounded by a car bombing close to a bus terminal in southeastern Turkey.\n\nThe bomb went off as a police vehicle was going past the Baglar district of Diyarbakir, the capital of its namesake province, about 170 kilometers (100 miles) from the Syrian border, Anadolu reported. \n\nThe injured include 14 civilians and 13 police. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack. \n\nMarch 19: Istanbul blast kills 4 foreigners\n\nA suicide bomber detonated explosives in a busy tourist area of central Istanbul, killing at least four people and wounding 36 others.\n\nTwo of the four dead were American-Israeli dual citizens, an Israeli government source and a US source said. A third Israeli also died, along with an Iranian.\n\nInterior Minister Efkan Ala identified that attacker as Mehmet Ozturk and claimed he had links to ISIS.\n\nMarch 13: Kurdish rebels claim Ankara blast\n\nThirty-seven people died in when a car bomb ripped through a busy square in Turkey's capital, Ankara.\n\nThe Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, or TAK -- a militant offshoot of the Kurdish separatist group PKK, which seeks an independent state in Turkey -- boasted that its members carried out this attack.\n\nA ceasefire between Turkey and the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, fell apart last summer. Since then, Turkish forces have bombed the terror group's positions in northern Iraq and imposed curfews in crackdowns on heavily Kurdish areas in southeastern Turkey.  \n\nFebruary 17: Explosion hits military vehicles \n\nAn explosion apparently targeting military vehicles in Ankara left 29 dead and 61 wounded, according to Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus. All but one of the fatalities were members of the security forces.\n\nThree military vehicles and one private vehicle were stopped at a traffic light when the bomb went off, sending large flames shooting into the night sky.\n\nLater that week, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons called that attack a \"suicide revenge mission\" for Turkish military operations in the southeastern Turkish district of Cizre and threatened more violence.\n\nJanuary 12: Strike near tourist attractions\n\nA suicide blast in Istanbul's Sultanahmet Square killed 13 people, eight of them Germans, in what was viewed as a strike against both Turkish culture and the country's multibillion-dollar tourism industry.\n\nThe explosion ripped through a typically busy area between the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque, both major tourist attractions in Istanbul.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu blamed ISIS, which has entrenched itself in neighboring Syria and Iraq while lashing out elsewhere again and again.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -11.7529878616333, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 941, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 41, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 11.6484312426, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 41, "mft_sum": 48, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161211110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.1009564293305, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.36363636364}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/15/politics/white-house-trump-russia-earnest/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1007, "scraper_regex": 1145}}, "headline": "Gloves-off White House creates rift between Obama and Trump teams", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1145, "date": "20161216050000", "story_content": "Donald Trump's dismissal of US intelligence about Russian election meddling has deeply alarmed the White House, prompting a new and combative approach to the President-elect that's caused rifts between the incoming and outgoing administrations.\n\nEven as President Barack Obama seeks to maintain an amicable relationship with Trump in an attempt to influence his successor's agenda, the public spat between aides over Russia's hacking has turned into the type of bitter back-and-forth the White House initially sought to avoid in the days immediately following the election.\n\nObama is also expected to address the Russian hacking allegations during his final planned news conference of the year from the White House on Friday at 2 p.m. ET.\n\nAlso fueling the rhetoric: Democrats' complaints the White House was slow in confronting Russia's hacking in the final days of the presidential campaign, a claim the White House disputes.\n\nThe latest volley came from former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway who said Friday that Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton could bring a ceasefire between them if they \"actually love the country enough.\"\n\n\"If you want to shut this down and you actually love the country enough to have the peaceful transition in our great democracy between the Obama administration and the Trump administration, there are a couple people in pretty prominent positions -- one is named Obama, one is named Hillary Clinton, since his people are trying to fight over her election still, they could shut this down,\" Conway told Fox News.\n\nOn Thursday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest escalated his post-election criticism of Trump, insisting it was plainly obvious to the Republican's team that Russia was interfering in the US election to bolster their chances of victory.\n\nHe dismissed the President-elect's response as unserious, and encouraged Trump to answer questions about the hacking instead of questioning US intelligence.\n\n\"It's just a fact -- you all have it on tape -- that the Republican nominee for president was encouraging Russia to hack his opponent because he believed that that would help his campaign,\" Earnest said, calling it a \"basic fact\" of the presidential contest.\n\n\"I don't know if it was a staff meeting or if he had access to a briefing or he was just basing his assessment on a large number of published reports, but Mr. Trump obviously knew that Russia was engaged in malicious cyberactivity that was helping him and hurting Hillary Clinton's campaign,\" Earnest said.\n\nTrump tore into Earnest while speaking at a rally Thursday night in Hershey, Pennsylvania, calling him a \"foolish guy.\"\n\n\"He could say, ladies and gentlemen today we have totally defeated ISIS and it wouldn't sound good, OK? All right?\" Trump said.\n\nTrump didn't let his criticism of Earnest undo the largely positive comments he has made in recent weeks about Obama. Instead, Trump suggested that Earnest could be \"getting his orders from somebody else,\" though he did not elaborate on whom he believes is breathing orders into the White House press secretary's ear.\n\nDavid Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Obama, said it was \"highly unlikely\" Earnest was scaling up his hits on Trump without the President's approval.\n\n\"A press secretary doesn't go out and make statements like that on an unauthorized basis,\" said Axelrod, now a CNN senior political commentator. \n\nTensions rising\n\nThe public acrimony between the two camps has escalated in recent weeks, far exceeding tension between Obama's transition team and President George W. Bush's administration in 2008.\n\nIt's a distant cry from the days immediately following Trump's victory, when Obama and his aides were careful to avoid repeating their campaign trail criticisms of Trump, insisting the transition of power proceed professionally and without political bias. \n\nWhite House officials said they were looking to establish a clear message of calm and continuity at a moment of deep concern about Trump's preparation for the job and his foreign policy priorities.\n\nObama and some top aides were said to be irritated when reports emerged that Trump seemed stunned at the scale of the presidency during his Oval Office meeting on November 10 -- and they were concerned it could lead to him turning away from Obama, who remains intent on not antagonizing Trump as he continues phone consultations with his successor.\n\nConversations between the two men continue, including last weekend, and both sides insist the actual work of transferring power is proceeding professionally.\n\nBut in public, the spat over Russia has revealed a deep divide. \n\nThe President-elect's dismissal of US intelligence pinning Russia to the hacking was \"materially different\" from Trump's other bombastic statements, according to one White House official who spoke anonymously to describe internal thinking. It motivated the White House to alter its approach.\n\nObama administration officials viewed Trump as waging an outright attack on the intelligence community, the official said, and worried about the implications of his words on national security going forward. \n\nIn his briefings, Earnest has resumed tying Trump to Russia, a staple of Obama's own campaign stump speech.\n\n\"It was the President-elect who, over the course of the campaign, indicated that he thought that President Putin was a strong leader,\" he said on Monday, continuing with a litany of examples meant to demonstrate a tight alliance with Moscow. \"His campaign didn't make any effort to obscure this.\" \n\nDespite an initial reluctance to withhold comment on Trump's cabinet picks, he's tied the President-elect's selection as secretary of state, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, to Trump's approach to Russia.\n\n\"The President-elect indicated his intent, if elected President, to pursue warmer relations with Russia,\" he said Tuesday. \"What better way to do that than to choose somebody who has been awarded the Order of Friendship by Vladimir Putin to be your secretary of state?\"\n\nEarnest defends White House\n\nEarnest has also found himself rebutting accusations from Democrats that the administration acted slowly to identify Russia as the hacking culprit. \n\nEarnest has argued that pushing the intelligence community to offer an assessment sooner would appear like political interference. And he's claimed Moscow's actions and intentions were clear, including to the Republican nominee.\n\n\"It benefited the Trump campaign. And it hurt the Clinton campaign. That's why the Republican nominee was hoping that they would do more of it,\" he said Wednesday. \"That's why his staffers were hoping they would do more of it. That is why in the days leading up to election day, the Republican nominee himself was encouraging people to check out WikiLeaks.\"\n\nThe rhetoric reflects a more combative transition than Obama underwent in 2008, though some tensions existed between his team and Bush's outgoing administration over economic issues.\n\nJim McGrath, a close aide to the Bush family, tweeted that the press secretary in the final days of George W. Bush's presidency was not so critical of the then-President-elect.\n\n\"Remember when @DanaPerino trashed Barack Obama from WH podium after George W. Bush pledged full cooperation w the transition? Me neither,\" he tweeted.

He killed in his flat, then dumped the bodies 300 meters away. They were all young men who died the same way,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"The idea that it wasn't linked beggars belief.\"\n\nPolice under investigation \n\nOn Friday Port was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders of fashion student Anthony Walgate, 23; Gabriel Kovari, 22, originally from Slovakia; fellow chef Daniel Whitworth, 21; and forklift truck driver Jack Taylor, 25 -- crimes that Port denied.\n\nLondon's Metropolitan Police admitted there may have been \"missed opportunities to catch Port sooner\" during the spate of murders between June 2014 and September 2015. \n\nThe force is now reviewing the deaths of dozens of men who also used sex-enhancing drugs, amid concerns that cases previously dismissed as drug overdoses could be further victims.\n\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has also launched an investigation into police handling of the case.\n\nWhat if the victims were women?\n\nLeading gay rights activist Peter Tatchell questioned whether homophobia and class played a role in police conduct.\n\n\"If four young middle class women had been murdered in Mayfair, I believe the police would have made a public appeal much sooner and mounted a far more comprehensive investigation,\" he said, referring to a wealthy area of inner London.\n\n\"The killing of low income gay men in working class Barking was treated very differently -- police officers stand accused of class, gender and sexuality bias.\"\n\nCriminologist Wilson agreed that the case had \"a great deal to do with the persistence of homophobia generally and within the police.\" \n\nHowever he added that one group of female victims similarly ignored by the police were sex workers.\n\n\"It was some way down the line before the continuing disappearance of women in Ipswich started to have an impact on public consciousness,\" he said of the 2006 Ipswich murders of five prostitutes by serial killer Steven Wright. \n\n\"One of the sad things is that everyone is equal before the law -- but the level of policing they get is often dependent on other issues.\"\n\nNewspaper tip-off ignored?\n\nWhen Benjamin Cohen, chief executive of LGBT news site PinkNews, was contacted by a friend of victim Gabriel Kovari asking him to investigate a link between the Barking murders, he says police dissuaded him from pursuing the story. \n\n\"They told us there wasn't a link between what was at that point three deaths,\" Cohen told CNN. \"Essentially, they gave the indication it would be a bad idea for us to report anything as it would cause people to be fearful.\n\n\"They were saying the deaths were not in suspicious circumstances,\" he added. \"But if it were three young women murdered in Islington or Hampstead and they had an inquiry from the Daily Mail, I cannot believe that would happen,\" Cohen said of the high-end London boroughs.\n\nChillingly, it was Port who called the police pretending to be a bystander who spotted the body of his first murder victim Anthony Walgate. He was later arrested but only charged with perverting the course of justice and jailed for eight months.\n\nPort went on to kill three more men, and Cohen expresses disbelief that police were able to let the killer slip through their fingers so easily. \n\n\"I can imagine Netflix making this into a 10-part series where the murderer just keeps getting ignored,\" he said.\n\n'You don't have chemsex by yourself' \n\nProsecutors said Port targeted victims on Grindr and other gay dating sites and apps, then plied them with drinks laced with fatal amounts of the drug GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyrate, otherwise known as liquid ecstasy.\n\nHe then raped them while they were unconscious and before they died, according to testimony at the Central Criminal Court of England and Wales, commonly known as the Old Bailey.\n\nPort dragged the bodies not far from his home and planted drugs on or near their bodies to make it look as though they had overdosed.\n\nCohen believes another reason why police may have overlooked the serial killer's involvement, was \"because of the use of the drug GHB and its prevalence among the gay community.\"\n\n\"It's quite a problem in the gay community in London, of people using these drugs in chemsex,\" he said of the group sex sessions often organized through dating apps. \n\nGHB, along with crystal meth, is often associated with chemsex due to its ability to induce heightened arousal, sexual stamina, and reduce inhibition.\n\nRead more: What is chemsex? \n\n\"But the thing that's odd to me is, you don't have chemsex by yourself, you have chemsex with someone else,\" said Cohen. \"So if all of these people had been taking this drug, they must have been sleeping with someone to do it.\"\n\nThat person was a lot closer than they thought.

At one point, he expressed reservation about a lower court opinion that went in favor of the Virginia plans. \n\nMonday's case represents another example of how the recent presidential election could profoundly impact the future of the Supreme Court. During the campaign, Hillary Clinton stressed the importance of voting rights and vowed to nominate a justice who would work to reverse the impact of Shelby County v. Texas, a 2013 5-4 decision that struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nBut Donald Trump is likely to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia with a like-minded conservative. If Trump were to get the opportunity to fill a second seat, he could further solidify the Shelby majority. \n\nOn Monday, civil rights groups and Democrats came to court to challenge plans they said unnecessarily packed African-Americans into districts with the aim of diluting minority presence in neighboring districts. \n\nMark Elias, a lawyer challenging the plans who also served as Clinton's top election lawyer, said the maps were drawn to diminish minority voters' impact in electing candidates of their choice. \n\nBut Paul Clement \u2014 a lawyer for the states -- defended the plans, arguing that the states find themselves in a bind, often seeking a sweet spot between federal law and constitutional requirements. \n\nOn the one hand, the Voting Rights Act requires that the legislature take race into consideration when drawing lines. At the same time, the court has said that the Equal Protection Clause prevents race from being the dominant factor in those decisions absent a compelling justification. \n\nKennedy's comments suggested a discomfort with race being used as a tipping point without the proper scrutiny.\n\n\"I have a problem with that,\" he said at one point. \n\nIn 2015, Kennedy voted with his liberal colleagues in a case out of Alabama concerning how districts could be drawn. But he also voted with the majority in Shelby County. \n\nThe first case, Bethune Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, deals with a Virginia legislative map that was redrawn in 2010 after the census. Twelve districts for the State House of Delegates were drawn to attain a 55% Black Voting Age population. Critics argue that the maps pack African-Americans in the district and dilute their presence in other districts. \n\nA lower court upheld the districts, saying that race did not predominate in 11 of the 12 districts and in the 12th there was a permissible justification to have race predominate. \n\nThe second case concerns two federal congressional district maps that were drawn in North Carolina to ensure that each had a Black Voting Age population of 50%.\n\nIn that case, a lower court said the maps were unconstitutional. \n\nAllison Riggs, a lawyer for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, who filed a brief in support of the challengers, rejected any argument that the states are caught between a rock and a hard place. \n\n\"The reality is it is not difficult to comply with both the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution,\" she said. \"All you need to do is avoid racial quotas and look at political realities on the ground in each district.\" ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.51968502998352, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 599, "FairnessVirtue": 13, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.6386356538499998, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.3388981636060096, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/asia/south-korea-president-scandal-explained/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "South Korea presidential scandal: What you need to know", "wordcount_as_scraped": 860, "date": "20161102090000", "story_content": "South Korea has been plunged into a political scandal that has engulfed the presidency of Park Geun-hye and has seen thousands of protesters take to the streets. \n\nLawmakers have voted to impeach Park by a vote of 234 to 56, stripping away her executive powers.   A court will now decide whether she should be kicked out of office, a process that could take up to 180 days. \n\nThe drama surrounds Park's friend and informal adviser, Choi Soon-sil, who prosecutors have detained on charges of abuse of power and attempted fraud following accusations she had access to secret government documents and intervened in state affairs. \n\nWho are the Chois? \n\nPark's relationship with Choi and her father Choi Tae-min has long been controversial in Korea. \n\nThe elder Choi first became close with Park following the death of her mother at the hands of a North Korean assassin in 1974, while Park's father, dictator Park Chung-hee, was president. \n\nAccording to the Korea Times, Choi founded the Eternal Life Church in the 1970s, mixing aspects Christianity, Buddhism and indigenous Korean religion Cheondism, which incorporates elements of shamanism. \n\nChoi named himself a modern day Buddha and called for all people to strive for eternal life. \n\nA confidential 2007 US diplomatic cable, published by Wikileaks, referenced rumors that Choi had \"complete control over Park's body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result.\" \n\nAfter Park's father was assassinated in 1979 by the then director of the Korean equivalent of the CIA, his killer cited Choi's relationship with the younger Park as one of the reasons.\n\nEven members of Park's family expressed concern. Her younger sister Guen-ryong and brother Ji-man filed a petition in 1990 to then-President Roh Tae-woo expressing concerns that Choi was manipulating Park. \n\nWhat influence did Choi Soon-sil have? \n\nAfter her father died in 1994 at age 82, Choi Soon-sil succeeded him as church leader and spiritual mentor to Park, as the former first daughter became a political force of her own. \n\n\"The family has had an extraordinary influence over Park Geun-hye for essentially her entire adult life,\" David Kang, a Korea expert at the University of Southern California, told CNN. \n\n\"It's much more than simply, 'oh she knows this person,' it's deeply intertwined, almost like they're Rasputin and Park Geun-hye is just a puppet.\"\n\nThough she never held an official position, recent revelations showed that Choi was given advance access to presidential speeches and other documents. \n\nLocal media and opposition parties have accused Choi of abusing her relationship with the president to force companies to donate millions of dollars to foundations she runs. \n\nIn a televised apology, Park said Choi looked at \"some documents\" for a certain period of time after Park took office, but didn't specify what they were.\n\n\"I am shocked and my heart is breaking for causing public concern,\" Park said. \n\nShamanism and cults\n\nWhile much of the outrage has surrounded Choi's alleged influence over Korean politics, the scandal has also shone a light on the prevalence of cults and alternative religious movements in the country. \n\nKorean shamanism, or Muism, is an ethnic Korean religion with similarities to Japanese Shintoism. \n\nAccording to the Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Muism \"focuses on solving the problems of daily life through communication between humans and the spiritual world, with shamans acting as liaisons.\" \n\nThe country is also home to the Unification Church, known as the \"Moonies\" for founder Sun Myung Moon, famous for mass weddings and allegedly forcing members to disconnect from their families. \n\nWhile Christianity and Buddhism dominate Korean religious life, some churches incorporate shamanistic practices and many people consult with fortune tellers or shamans. \n\nChoi's movement mixed strands of all three faiths, and claimed the ability to communicate with the dead and produce objects offering magical protection, according to Korean media.\n\nDuring Park's inauguration, the President stood in front of a tree bedecked with colorful silk purses, reportedly recommended by Choi to bring prosperity and good fortune. \n\nStemming the scandal\n\nThousands of protesters took to the streets to call for Park's resignation after news of the scandal broke. Prosecutors investigated Choi and placed her under \"emergency detention.\" \n\nSouth Korean presidents are immune from prosecution for anything but insurrection or treason, and Park's term wasn't due to end until 2018. \n\nThe country's constitutional court will now deliberate the impeachment motion against Park, a process that could take up to 180 days. \n\nPrime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn is now acting President, and will hold the post for the duration of the court's deliberation.\n\nReputational fallout \n\nPark's approval ratings have plummeted, hampering her administration's ability to tackle key economic and security issues. \n\nThe scandal exacerbated her Saenuri Party's weak standing in the National Assembly following April elections. \n\nNorth Korea was also quick to rain criticism on Park, a longtime target of the country's propaganda machine. \n\n\"Choi's acts are clear evidence of Park Geun-hye being an incompetent old person,\" an article on propaganda website Uriminzokkiri said, according to the Korea Times.\n\n\"No one has ever heard of such an ugly political scandal involving the President memorizing speeches inspected by a random swindler anywhere else in the world.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.08163261413574, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 826, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.7453943401, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161102090000, "PurityVirtue": 4, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.7845036319612597, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/opinions/trump-act-on-opioids-epidemic-kennedy-oz-rosenberg-weston/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Dr. Oz and co-authors' plea to Donald Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 987, "date": "20161117220000", "story_content": "Dear President-elect Trump:\n\nAs you set priorities for your upcoming administration, we urge you to focus energy and resources on addressing a public health crisis plaguing our country's citizens: addiction -- and, in particular, opioid addiction.\n\nLet's start with the larger problem: Nearly 21 million Americans today suffer from a substance use disorder involving alcohol or drugs, with almost 2 million of those laying their addiction at the feet of a prescription opioid -- medicines such as Vicodin, Percocet and OxyContin, obtained legally and under the advice of their doctor. \n\nHowever, prescription opioid usage doesn't stay within the realm of legality for long. Whether it's the high cost or difficulty of refilling prescriptions once misuse is suspected by a medical professional, research shows prescription opioid abusers often turn to heroin.\n\nHeroin bears a very similar chemical structure to opioids, binds to the same group of receptors in the brain and ultimately produces the same result in the body: an increase in pain tolerance and a sense of euphoria.\n\nIn three separate studies conducted this year by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), nearly half of young people surveyed who inject heroin reported abusing prescription opioids before starting to use heroin.\n\nThrough extensive research, the NIDA has further concluded that as many as 80% of today's heroin addicts began their abuse history with prescription drugs. \n\nAnd whether one's opioid addiction is to prescription or illegal drugs, the consequences are dire: of the over 40,000 Americans that die each year from drug overdoses, more than half of those deaths involve opioids. \n\nWe cannot dismiss these victims of addiction as thrill-seekers or \"junkies;\" they are people, our fellow Americans -- from blue-collar workers to white-collar executives, to homemakers and even health care professionals -- many of whom sought legitimate medical care for very real health problems. They are our parents, our spouses, our children, our siblings, our grandparents, our friends and our neighbors.\n\nDespite our country's knowledge, resources and wealth, we have failed to adequately address as a nation the epidemic that grips them. Why? Because we have allowed addiction to carry with it the stigma of moral failure instead of calling it what it actually is: a chronic disease of the brain.\n\nEfforts to address addiction as a public health crisis have been severely hampered by this stigma, as well as politics and fear at every level. In the 1980's, the HIV/AIDS epidemic showed us first hand the damage this stigmatization and fear can do to our nation and its citizens. We must learn from our past and not repeat these mistakes, which cost the lives of millions of Americans.\n\nInstead of approaching our fear of the addiction epidemic with a \"Forget Everything and Run\" philosophy -- like we did with HIV/AIDS and even cancer just 20 years ago -- we must instead \"Face Everything and Recover.\"\n\nThe first ever report, \"Facing Addiction in America,\" just released by our nation's surgeon general, provides us -- and you, President-elect Trump, as our nation's 45th president -- with a non-partisan, science-based opportunity to galvanize the public, policymakers and health-care systems to work together and ensure substance use disorders at all levels of severity can be effectively addressed with the skill, urgency and compassion they require. \n\nFrom Surgeon General Murthy's report, we have learned that prevention works; treatment is effective; and recovery is possible for everyone, with more than 25 million Americans currently in remission from substance use disorder and living healthy, productive lives. \n\nFrom the report, we also have learned that substance misuse costs our country $442 billion annually in health-care expenditures, lost productivity and criminal justice costs. By integrating substance use disorder services into general health care, we can yield better outcomes for individuals and our country at large, with studies showing that every dollar spent on substance use disorder treatment saves $4 in health-care costs and $7 in criminal justice costs.\n\nWhile science tells us how to solve this problem, we need you and other elected officials to help marshal the resources to take on this public health crisis. We applaud the attention you placed on the issue of prescription drug abuse during your campaign for president, and appreciate you stating your commitment to making this a part of your health care policy agenda. And, now it's time for action.\n\nAs our president, you can help address addiction in American communities by calling for the strengthening of prevention programs and increasing access to treatment.\n\nThis means making evidence-informed policy and program changes at both the federal and state levels; and providing additional training for health-care professionals to explore less addictive treatments for pain than opioids -- and to become better at recognizing the signs of addiction and subsequently treating it. \n\nWe also urge you to explore forging public-private partnerships -- such as the one between the Office of the Surgeon General and \"Facing Addiction\" -- so the American people understand that no one remains unaffected, regardless of age, race, sexual preference, creed, religion or tax bracket, thus shattering that stigma that has paralyzed our progress to date.\n\nSimply put, there is no reason we shouldn't approach addiction with the same focus and determination we do diabetes, heart disease or cancer.\n\nEach of us -- the authors of this letter -- have dedicated our life's work to helping people live their healthiest lives, and lead platforms and organizations which every week, respectively, reach more than 60 million online health consumers and millions of daytime television viewers; 10 million adults, children and families living with mental illnesses and addictions; and the nation's 3.6 million registered nurses. \n\nAs such, we feel compelled to speak as one unified front, and implore you, the 45th president of the United States, to make addiction a top priority in your administration. With millions of American lives on the line, how we respond to this crisis is a moral test for America; and how our next president responds to this crisis is a moral test for you, Mr. Trump.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.64533817768097, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 960, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.6021114102099996, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161117220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 3.9583333333333304, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/26/us/chicago-police-shooting/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Chicago officer who fatally shot man relieved of powers", "wordcount_as_scraped": 837, "date": "20161127000000", "story_content": "A Chicago police officer who said he shot and killed a black man this week after the teenager pointed a gun at him has been relieved of his police powers, the Chicago Police Department said Saturday. \n\nThe sergeant involved in the shooting told investigators that Kajuan Raye, 19, twice pointed a weapon at him, but no gun has been found in the evidence gathering, the department said. \n\n\"Based on the little information we know at this point, I have concerns about this incident,\" police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said that a preliminary report from the medical examiner's office, which determined Raye had been shot in the back, also figured into his decision to take the officer's gun and badge away.\n\nThe city's Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the shooting. Police have not released the sergeant's name.  \n\nRaye's death comes after months of heavy scrutiny of the department over cases of alleged overreach in officer-involved shootings.\n\nThe shooting\n\nPolice have said the sergeant was called to an intersection near Ogden Park in south Chicago late Wednesday about a report of a \"battery in progress.\"\n\nWhen the sergeant approached Raye, who the officer said matched the description of a suspect, Raye ran and the sergeant chased him, police said.\n\n\"The sergeant then told investigators that the offender turned and pointed a weapon in the direction of the sergeant on two separate occasions during the pursuit,\" Johnson said.\n\nInvestigators searched, but did not find a weapon, the superintendent said.\n\nThere is video that shows Raye running, but the officer chasing him is out of the cameras' view and the footage does not show the shooting, CNN affiliate WLS reported. \n\nFamily's lawyers call for prosecution \n\nRaye's relatives said he did not own a gun, WLS reported.  \n\nRaye, of Dolton, just south of Chicago, was a \"fun-loving and happy kid who had a bright future,\" his relatives said in a statement released by the Montgomery Law Firm, which says it is representing the family in the case.\n\nRaye's family is \"heartbroken that their son is dead at the hands of a police officer who does not value the sanctity of life of black males,\" the statement reads. \"As a city we continue to struggle with police who are afraid of and have deep seeded prejudices against black youth. \n\nThe family has asked its lawyers to \"investigate, get answers and hold accountable this officer and Chicago Police Department,\" the statement reads.\n\nA lawyer with the firm, Jay Payne, told CNN the claim that Raye pointed a weapon is absurd.\n\n\"We will be asking the Cook County state's attorney to prosecute this officer,\" Payne said. \n\nChicago police under fire over shootings\n\nRaye's death comes more than two years after the shooting by Chicago police of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, a case that spurred reforms and protests and helped fuel a national conversation about police officers' use of deadly force.\n\nMcDonald's death in October 2014 went largely unacknowledged until a judge ordered the department to release dashboard-camera footage that contradicted officers' accounts of the shooting. \n\nJust before the video was released in November 2015, Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder in the McDonald case; he pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. He was the first Chicago officer charged with first-degree murder since 1980.  \n\nThe superintendent of police at the time of the McDonald shooting, Garry McCarthy, was fired by Mayor Rahm Emanuel this year, and the Independent Police Review Authority, the agency charged with investigating police-involved shootings, is being overhauled.\n\nYears of mistrust\n\nEmanuel created a Police Accountability Task Force in response to public outcry for accountability and transparency after the release of the McDonald shooting video.\n\nIn April, a report from the task force said police \"have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color\" and have alienated blacks and Hispanics with the use of force and a longstanding code of silence.\n\nDuring the past eight years, 74% of people killed or injured by Chicago police officers were African-American, the report said.\n\nThe task force, which included five Chicagoans who have been leaders in the justice system, found that 72% of people stopped by Chicago police in 2014 were African-American, and 17% were Hispanic.\n\nTo address the slew of systemic issues within the police department, the task force recommended nearly 100 changes. Emanuel has announced the implementation of nearly one-third of those recommendations, including replacing the Independent Police Review Authority with an agency that has \"more independence.\"\n\nThe city also plans to hire 970 officers over the next two years.\n\nThe number of homicides in Chicago this year is significantly higher than recent years. At least 685 civilians have been killed, according to a tabulation by the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAccording to an Independent Police Review Authority report, Chicago police shot 17 people in the first nine months of the year. One of the shootings was classified an officer suicide.

They gave the baby a 15-20% chance of surviving her first year and warned Allison that even if her daughter made it through that, she may not survive the toddler years. \n\nAllison, a nurse and mother of two other young children, decided to \"carry Sky as far as she wanted to go.\" She reached out to documentary photographer Ash Adams, aware of her documentary body of work on birth in Alaska. Allison didn't know how much time she'd have with Sky and thought she'd like to have something documented of what time she did have with her. She told Adams that she wanted Sky's birth story to be shared and be a part of something bigger. \n\nAdams was at the hospital when Allison delivered Sky, and she said she will never forget the emotional memory of the medical team cutting the cord and whisking Sky down the hall to be evaluated by the cardiology team. Allison, distraught, screamed as they took her baby away. Adams followed the team down the hall, wondering if Sky had survived the birth.\n\n\"The team put (Sky) on the examination table on her side, and she opened one eye from a very pink face and looked right at me from just about a foot away,\" Adams said. \"And I knew that she was going to live beyond that day.\"\n\nAdams and Allison developed a bond, and Adams asked if she could keep documenting their story. Adams herself is a mother of two small children, and she said she feels very connected to the Allison family, especially since she was there the day that Sky was born 19 months ago. \n\nSince then, Sky has endured three open-heart surgeries and two invasive surgeries on her intestines. Another open-heart surgery is most likely in her future. Parts of her heart will need to be replaced.\n\n\"Sky has struggled to just be a baby and toddler, struggled to develop like any other baby in spite of her often lower-than-normal oxygen saturations, inpatient hospitalizations and physical recovery times,\" Adams said. \"She is walking now and cognitively developing like any other 19-month-old in spite of all of those things.\"\n\nOver time, Adams has watched the family dynamic shift to make sure the children are always nurtured. \n\nWhen Sky has to be in the hospital, her mother is right next to her as her source of comfort and a vigilant advocate for her well-being and quality of life. She researches the options for Sky's future every day. She lives and sleeps in the hospital room and campaigns to be able to share a bed with Sky and hold her child. \n\nThe family lives in Alaska and has to travel far from home to find the care that Sky needs, so Allison's husband, Aaron, becomes the primary parent for Story and Sage when Sky and her mother are at the hospital. Adams said Aaron, a paramedic, works hard to keep them entertained, and both parents also make sure to explain to Story and Sage what Sky is going through. The children are gentle with Sky and her \"broken heart,\" and they have bonded with her. \n\n\"Jen and Aaron are doing all they can to deal with the stress of providing financially and emotionally for their family,\" Adams said. \"Quality of life, not just longevity, is important to them, and so there is also joy intermixed with this stress. \n\n\"But they are fighting for those moments. All along there's been a fight just to get to the next month, the next milestone. It's a very tenuous kind of hope. A hope that Sky lives, but also that she lives well.\"\n\nAdams has captured their story through black-and-white images to work around the distracting colors and harsh lighting of a hospital backdrop. It also helps her to focus on the emotional narrative of the story. \n\nAlthough Adams was a photographer in high school and college, it wasn't until she had children that she saw storytelling in a new way and began working on more photo stories. The idea of motherhood as a life-changing experience has caused Sky's story to resonate with her.\n\nDocumenting Sky's battle to live also opened Adams' eyes to the struggle of parents who have hospitalized children.\n\n\"I think I had an idea that parents had more support than they do in these situations,\" Adams said. \"I hope that people see how much love and difficulty goes into having a child who is inpatient intermittently from a young age, and are impressed by the resilience and strength of this family. That maybe they think about how our systems do and do not provide support for families like this, for babies like Sky and mothers like Jen. I hope that they see that this is a family that is trying.\"\n\nAdams has hope for Sky as well and plans to keep documenting the family's journey. \n\n\"I want Sky to live,\" she said. \"I want to photograph her going to kindergarten, graduating high school. I want that for Sky, for all of them.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.569476068019867, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 798, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.0233252996900006, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.25563909774436, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/us/oakland-fire-derick-almena-ghost-ship-life/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 641, "scraper_regex": 1067}}, "headline": "Court documents show signs of trouble at Ghost Ship before fire ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1067, "date": "20161206190000", "story_content": "As investigators sift through the debris of the charred Oakland warehouse that became a mass grave for at least 36 people, court documents obtained by CNN provide an unsettling glimpse of life in the facility before it caught fire Friday evening.\n\nThe documents are requests for restraining orders filed by and against Derick Ion Almena, the leaseholder of the cavernous structure known as the Ghost Ship.\n\nThey contain allegations of theft, assault and intimidation in which Almena is in one case the alleged aggressor and, in the other, a victim.\n\n \n\nThe accounts, while unproven, add to a chaotic portrait of the way the building was allegedly maintained and managed prior to the deadly blaze. \n\nAttempts to reach Almena were unsuccessful. In a brief interview aired on NBC's \"Today Show\" Tuesday, he said he was \"incredibly sorry\" for what had happened at the warehouse.\n\nAt the time of the fire, the site was the subject of a pending investigation by Oakland's Building and Planning Department. Officials were looking into complaints that the property had piles of garbage and had been improperly remodeled for residential use. Officials also said the dance party going on at the facility when the fire broke out was held without a permit.\n\nThe blaze is now under criminal investigation. Officials have not determined its cause or origin, but conditions at the site prior to the fire -- and how it was being used -- could be factors in determining culpability.\n\n2 men asked for restraining order\n\nOne of the restraining order requests was filed by a man who said he rented space from Almena for a New Year's Eve event hosted at the warehouse two years ago. \n\nPhillipe Lewis wrote that he was accosted by Almena when he returned to the warehouse to clean up on January 2, 2015. \n\nHe said Almena demanded additional money, stole his sound system, physically assaulted him and threatened to go get a gun. \n\nLewis' friend, Matthew Elvey, began to record the alleged assault on his iPhone, according to his own request for a restraining order against Almena.\n\nElvey said his phone was taken from him and that he was \"beaten by Derick's staff at his direction.\"\n\n\"My shoulder was pulled from the socket. I was kicked in the forehead, shoulder and jaw,\" Elvey wrote. \n\nOakland police arrived at the scene in the aftermath of the disturbance. Elvey declined medical treatment and no one was arrested, according to a police report. \n\nThe request for a restraining order was dismissed, according to court records. Neither Lewis nor Almena appeared in court,  records show. It's unclear whether Elvey failed to appear or if he did show up but asked that the matter be dismissed.\n\nElvey declined comment on the case. Lewis did not return a phone call seeking comment. \n\nAlmena asks for restraining order\n\nAbout a month after that incident, Almena filed a request for a restraining order against a woman who had once rented an art space in the warehouse but who had since begun \"attempting to illegally squat\" there, according to the documents filed.\n\nHe accused the woman, Shelley Mack, of trying to provoke him by pushing him, slandering him, and making false accusations to child protective services about the way he cared for his kids.\n\nAlmena said Mack threatened to have her sons \"come over and blow my [expletive] head off.\" At one point, he alleged, he was chased by the Mack and her son, who was armed with a gun. Another time, he alleged, Mack's son kicked out the window of a car Almena's wife and young son were in. The broken glass cut his son, he said.\n\nMack, Almena wrote, is \"extorting me with fear tactics to avoid past due rental fees and legal eviction.\"\n\nHe sought a restraining order for himself, his wife and three children, then ages 11, 6 and 4.\n\n\"My family is in fear,\" Almena wrote.\n\n In a telephone interview with CNN on Tuesday, Mack vehemently denied the allegations. She'd only recently heard of them, she said, because Almena did not serve her with his court papers.\n\n \"He turns everything he's doing, and he claims that's what you're doing,\" Mack said. \"I'm really upset.... really mad. I deny everything.\"\n\n The request for a restraining order was denied when neither party showed up in court, records show.\n\nMack, a jewelry maker, said she moved into the warehouse in October 2014, paying $700 for rent. She was asked for another $700, earmarked for upgrades and repairs to the electrical system. Mack lived in an RV parked on the first floor of the warehouse, she said.\n\n\"They sold a dream,\" she said. \"We're all going to get together and do venues, collaborate as artists and become part of this collective.\"\n\nThe dream was never realized, and she left the Ghost Ship under police escort in February after a falling out with Almena. She said two officers accompanied her, at her request, because \"my life had been threatened, people pulled guns on me.\"\n\nWithin a month of moving in, Mack said, she learned that people weren't supposed to be living in the warehouse and so \"we had to hide certain things.\" There was just one, barely working bathroom shared by about 20 residents, she added. Heat, electricity and hot water were sporadic.\n\n\"The transformer blew maybe a couple of weeks after I moved in and we had no electricity and no heat. I asked why we didn't call PG&E.\" She said she discouraged from calling the utility company, and never saw an electric bill.  \n\nDanielle Boudreaux, who knew the couple for seven years and once was a close friend, said she was also shunned and harassed when she expressed her concerns about the conditions the couple's children were living under. \n\n\"I definitely let Derick know that it wasn't safe,\" she said. She even contacted family members of his wife Micah in Southern California because she was worried. It ended the friendship.\n\n\"Micah and Derick believed they were raising their kids in a free, artistic environment, and part of that was true. But there were red flags and very few people willing to stand up to Derick to say that things were wrong,\" she said.\n\n\"When I went to Micah's family, I didn't have a grudge against him. I was working with them for months, helping with their kids. When I called Micah's family, I called out of love.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.449856758117679, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 641, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.51606409147, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 13, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161206190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.02808112324493, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.1818181818200002}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/26/politics/understanding-unsc-resolution/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "What the UNSC resolution means for the US and Israel", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1254, "date": "20161227110000", "story_content": "The United Nations Security Council on Friday passed a resolution condemning Israel's settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The United States abstained on the resolution, allowing it to pass, rather than vetoing it -- as it usually does with resolutions it sees as overly critical of Israel.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned the US ambassador and launched a scathing attack Sunday on the Obama administration.\n\nHere are nine questions about the vote at the UN.\n\n1. What are the immediate effects of the UNSC resolution?\n\nThe resolution may have no immediate practical effects on Israel, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, or the peace process. That's because the resolution is non-binding, effectively creating guidelines and recommendations. The resolution would require follow-up action at the United Nations for it to have an immediate effect.\n\nIsrael is concerned about exactly that type of action. Specifically, Israel is worried about a resolution that would set conditions for negotiations. Such a resolution would issue parameters for some of the most sensitive issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including borders, the status of Jerusalem as a contested capital, Palestinian refugees, and a time-limit for negotiations.\n\nAn international peace conference in Paris scheduled for January 15 could be the forum for discussing such a resolution. That would give the international community time to introduce the resolution at the United Nations Security Council before the end of President Barack Obama's time in office. Israel has vowed not to attend the conference. The Palestinians say they will attend.\n\n2. What are the long-term effects?\n\nThe biggest blow is to Israel's settlement enterprise in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. This resolution has left little room for negotiation about the legality of the settlements, stating that Israel's settlements have \"no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.\"\n\nRELATED: US abstains as UN demands end to Israeli settlements\n\nWhen it comes to borders, the resolution does leave an opening for negotiations, saying there will be no changes to the June 4, 1967 \"other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations.\"\n\nThe resolution also calls on countries to recognize a difference between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories when dealing with Israel. That could lead to sanctions against products from Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\n\nPalestinian leaders say they will wait to see if Israel abides by the resolution. If not, they can pursue cases against Israeli leaders at the International Criminal Court (ICC) under the Geneva Convention. The ICC is already conducting an ongoing investigation into Israeli actions in the Palestinian territories.\n\n3. Will President-elect Donald Trump be able to repeal the resolution?\n\nTheoretically, yes, the incoming administration could repeal this resolution. Trump would have to introduce a new resolution that revokes this one entirely. Then he would need at least nine countries to vote for it and ensure that none of the Security Council's other permanent members -- Russia, UK, France, and China -- vetoed it.\n\nRealistically, that is incredibly unlikely to happen. There is a broad international consensus that settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are illegal and that they constitute an obstacle to peace. It is extremely unlikely that Trump would be able to find eight other nations on the Security Council willing to support revoking the new resolution. Even if he did, a permanent member veto is likely.\n\n4. Will the US and Israel take diplomatic action against the UN?\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, has threatened to cut US money to the United Nations over this resolution. The US currently provides 22% of the UN's budget.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that Israel will cut funding to five different UN organizations, totaling nearly $8 million. Netanyahu said Israel would reevaluate its relationships with UN representatives in Israel.\n\n5. What about Israel's diplomatic actions against the countries that voted for this resolution? What are the effects of those?\n\nOn Christmas Day, one day after the Security Council vote, Israel summoned the ambassadors of the United States and 10 of the countries that voted for the resolution to express his disappointment about the vote. Netanyahu followed that up by limiting working ties and high-level visits with the embassies of those countries who voted for the resolution and instructing his ministers to limit travel to those countries.\n\nMore than anything else, the intent of these diplomatic steps was to make a statement about how angry Netanyahu was about the vote. The decision to suspend working ties with embassies, even if there is no date for resuming those ties, is largely symbolic and has little practical effect on the relations between the nations. It does not affect trade, security cooperation, or other aspects of the relations.\n\nNotably, Netanyahu did not suspend working ties with the American embassy, even though most of his anger was directly at President Barack Obama.\n\n6. Is this the first UNSC resolution regarding settlements?\n\nNo, but it is the first resolution directly addressing Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1980. Resolution 465, passed on March 1, 1980, condemned \"the decision of the Government of Israel to officially support Israeli settlement in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967.\"\n\nOther Security Council resolutions relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been passed, but none addressed settlements.\n\n7. Is this the first time an American president has taken action on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his final days in office?\n\nNo. In fact, it's not all that uncommon. In 1988, Ronald Reagan began dialogue with the PLO before the end of his second term. In 2000, Bill Clinton laid out his vision for peace, now known as the \"Clinton Parameters.\" And in 2008, George W. Bush's envoy voted in favor of Security Council resolution 1850, which called for a renewal of the peace process.\n\n8. Is this the first time an American president has declined to use his veto at the Security Council?\n\nNo, other presidents have either declined to use their veto power or voted in favor of Security Council resolutions related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But it is the first time President Barack Obama has declined to use his veto. Obama has exercised the veto power of the United States at the Security Council on every other resolution relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nRELATED: Israel summons US ambassador as Netanyahu lashes out at Obama\n\nMost notably, he vetoed a 2011 Security Council resolution that was critical of settlements. At the time, US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice said, \"We reject in the strongest terms the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlement activity.\" But, she added, \"This draft resolution risks hardening the positions of both sides. It could encourage the parties to stay out of negotiations.\"\n\nIn abstaining from this vote and allowing the resolution to pass, current US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said, \"It is precisely our commitment to Israel's security that makes the United States believe that we cannot stand in the way of this resolution as we seek to preserve a chance of attaining our longstanding objective: two states living side-by-side in peace and security.\"\n\n9. So why all the Israeli criticism pointed at President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry?\n\nBecause this is the first Security Council resolution in more than 35 years to deal with Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The resolution lays out guidelines for dealing with the settlements, which is something no US President has done at the Security Council since 1980.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.2061069011688197, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1203, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 7.97516807253, "HarmVirtue": 24, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 57, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227110000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.73815461346633, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 5.18181818182}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/16/politics/russia-hacking-allegations-mikheil-saakashvili/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [630], "\u00e0": [632]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 646, "scraper_regex": 756}}, "headline": "Ex-Soviet states tell US 'I told you so' over Russia hacking allegations ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 756, "date": "20161216140000", "story_content": "In several former Soviet republics, top security officials and even a former president are saying \"I told you so\" amid allegations of possible Russian hacking targeting the US presidential election campaign.\n\n\"Some things you discovered now as new in your pre-election campaign we've been seeing it already for years,\" Janis Garisons, Secretary of State in Latvia's Defense Ministry, told CNN.\n\nLatvian government agencies come under frequent cyber attacks and other forms of hsybrid warfare that he believes originate from Russia, he said.\n\n\"For me, it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili told CNN.\n\n\"In 2012, they (Russia) were heavily involved in Georgian elections.

Russia for hacks\n\nMoscow denies involvement \n\nMoscow has denied any involvement in alleged hacking targeting the US election.\n\nOn Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it is \"indecent\" of the US to \"groundlessly\" accuse Russia of intervention in its elections, previously officials have accused the Obama administration of scape-goating Russia to cover for Hillary Clinton's defeat.  \n\nUkraine, which has been embroiled in a deadly two-year war against separatists backed by neighboring Russia, announced on Friday that several of its government agencies have recently been the target of ten major cyber attacks.\n\n\"The targets include the state railroad company, the finance ministry and state treasure,\" said Olena Gitlyanska, spokesperson for Ukraine's state Security Service.\n\n\"They were able to overcome the consequences,\" she added.\n\nA statement posted to Facebook by the Infrastructure Ministry confirmed its website had been hacked. \n\n\"We perceive this attacks on the web-site as part of attacks on the government resources, that have become stronger over the last week,\" the statement read, adding that news would be published on the ministry's Facebook page until the site was fully restored.\n\nLast December, a separate cyber attack on a Ukrainian power company succeeded in completely blacking out more than one hundred cities and partially depriving electricity to at least 186 other cities.\n\nRelated story: What you need to know about Russian hacking and the 2016 US election\n\nExperts from the US Department of Homeland Security assisted Ukraine with the subsequent investigation.\n\nThey concluded that the virus that targeted the electric company came from an infected Microsoft Word document believed to be of Russian origin.\n\nUkraine, Latvia and Georgia all have historically tense relationships with the Kremlin.\n\nAll three countries were ruled by Moscow for a half century or more when they were part of the Soviet Union. \n\nTop officials in these countries accuse the present-day Russian government of continuing to try to dominate these former Soviet states.\n\n\"We're facing Russian propaganda, information warfare and even psychological warfare almost daily,\" said Garisons, of the Latvian Defense Ministry.\n\n\"There's quite a clear attempt to undermine our statehood, or the belief of our people in our statehood.\"\n\nHybrid warfare strategies\n\nRussia's so-called hybrid warfare strategies are rooted in Soviet intelligence tactics that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, said Janis Sarts, director of the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence in Riga, which studies Russia's communications strategies.\n\n\"They use in a coordinated, coherent manner the traditional media, social media and also non-governmental actors and influence agents to achieve a desired effect on the audience,\" Sarts said.\n\nThe centre published a report on the sudden shift that Russian state media, followed by pro-Russian blogs and Internet trolls, made when Russia launched its surprise military intervention into Syria this year.\n\n\"In two weeks time, all the discussion was about these \"Nazi\" Ukrainians and their horrible crimes, and then there was a 180% turn ... to talking about Syria,\" Sarts said.\n\nSeated next to a bust of US president Ronald Reagan in Ukraine's capital Kiev, Saakashvili, who famously took his country to war against Russia and lost in 2008, outlined his view of Putin's endgame. \n\n\"The Kremlin ultimately and Putin especially, think that the United States need to be defeated,\" he told CNN.  \n\n\"That's what Putin sees as the endgame for himself.\"\n\n\"The destruction of NATO as an organization and the

connections to President-elect Donald J. Trump.\n\nPatrick is the senior pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, where the President-elect's mother, Mary, an immigrant from Scotland, was a member, and where her son was baptized and confirmed. When he takes the oath of office, Mr. Trump will rest his hand on the Lincoln Bible and on the Bible given to him \"by the Sunday Church School of the First Presbyterian Church, Jamaica, New York, Children's Day, June 12, 1955.\"\n\nScott is the senior pastor of Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in Manhattan. Fifth Avenue Presbyterian stands closer to Trump Tower than any church in the city. Sitting in his office, Mr. Trump has a direct view of the Celtic cross atop the church's spire.\n\nIn early December, we offered to pray for and speak with the President-elect. He accepted. Wednesday afternoon we offered him our counsel as he assumes the leadership of our country.\n\nSome will criticize our visit. Some worry that we will be \"used.\" But our worry, and the reason we wrote to Mr. Trump in the first place, is that the people who will interpret the American religious landscape to the new administration will not represent the breadth and depth of our country's faith communities. \n\nProponents of the prosperity gospel (such as Paula White) already have Mr. Trump's ear. He also spoke to us about his strong support among evangelicals. We explained that we come neither from prosperity gospel churches nor from the evangelical wing of American Christianity. We pastor \"purple churches\" -- congregations that are economically, racially and politically diverse, strong in faith, active in community.  \n\nThe United States is full of purple churches. Millions of Americans worship in diverse congregations, where believers have figured out how to overcome political disagreements and work together to build up individuals, families and neighborhoods. We want a government that helps to further this important work.\n\n\"You're all Christians,\" Mr. Trump responded. \n\nYes, we nodded. We are all Christians. As Christians, we all seek to follow Jesus Christ. But we don't always agree on which steps will lead us in that direction.\n\nWe hope, Mr. Trump, as you begin to lead this country, that you and your administration will listen to a diversity of Christians, and a diversity of leaders from other faiths, too. Local churches (and synagogues and mosques) are on the front lines as our nation seeks to address its most pressing issues: racism, homelessness, immigration, health care, economic opportunity and opiate addiction. We try to be mindful of how Scripture instructs us, over and over, to \"give justice to the weak and the orphan; maintain the right of the lowly and the destitute.\" (Psalm 82:3)\n\nPatrick's church in Queens is 354 years old -- older than the nation itself. In a way, this church is a mirror of our country. Once it was full of Scottish immigrants dreaming the dream. Now it is packed with African-Americans, and Afro-Caribbean, African and Latino immigrants, all dreaming the same dream, and hoping for opportunity, fairness and justice in this land.\n\nScott's church in Manhattan sits on the most expensive retail corridor in the world. Steps away from Ralph Lauren and Henri Bendel, the church has offered year-round shelter and services to the homeless of the neighborhood for more than 30 years.\n\nWhat voices will speak for the immigrant, for the homeless, for purple-church Christianity in the coming four years? \n\nWe invited Mr. Trump to come see our ministries at work. We offered our counsel. \n\nWe ended our short visit with Mr. Trump in prayer. We asked for God's help in healing deep societal rifts and in stepping forward to create a nation that serves all of its people, particularly those who are most vulnerable and in need. \n\n\"Deliver us, loving God, from rancor and cynicism,\" we prayed. \"Encourage us to kindness. Teach us to mend the tattered places in this society. Give us hope and holy perspective for the living of these days.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\n \n\n---------------------\n\n \n\nA prayer for the United States of America and the President-elect\n\n \n\nAlmighty God, all the people of the earth are yours. We are all your children.\n\n \n\nYour will is done when governments are rightly administered, liberty is preserved, justice is decreed, dignity is assured, and care is extended to the most vulnerable of your children.\n\n \n\nThis day, we ask that you would look with favor on President-elect Donald J. Trump. Protect him and keep his family safe. Grant to him equal doses of courage and humility. Guide him as he makes countless decisions. Give him wisdom and mercy. Enable him to find the right words: good words, true words, healing words.\n\n \n\nOur country's differences and divisions are vast. Deliver us, loving God, from rancor and cynicism. Forgive our sins. Encourage us to kindness. Teach us to mend the tattered places in this society. Give us hope and holy perspective for the living of these days.\n\n \n\nTender Creator, in some ways -- important ways -- we all want the same things. We want opportunity. We want fairness from our government. We want safety. We want order. We want clean water and fresh air. We want to come home at night, feeling like we are making progress, like we are part of something bigger than ourselves, like we matter.

Representatives of Feld Entertainment, the show's parent company, revealed that the circus would shut down forever in May. Less than 24 hours later, the venerable Big Apple Circus announced that it would sell off its assets in a bankruptcy auction on February 7. \n\nWhen Ringling Bros. and Big Apple Circus announced impending demise within a day of each other, it was hard, in some ways, to believe they had really come to the end of the road.  Each circus has faced the threat of death before. The nonprofit Big Apple Circus has weathered bone-thin budgets since its founding in 1977 and it survived the disastrous financial crisis in 2008. \n\nLikewise, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey confronted adversity throughout its 146-year history. On July 6, 1944, a horrific big-top fire at Hartford, Connecticut, killed 167 people and injured hundreds of others. The circus limped back to its winter quarters in Sarasota, Florida; five circus officials were tried, convicted (and later pardoned) for involuntary manslaughter.\n\nOn July 16, 1956, the circus performed its last show under a canvas big top at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: principal owner John Ringling North decided that labor costs and unionization battles had become too costly to preserve the big-top show. One thousand jobs vanished and the circus performed at indoor arenas thereafter. \n\nNonetheless, the American circus is hardly dead. In fact, circus arts are flourishing. Today, there are approximately 85 circus schools and training centers scattered across America, which teach children essential skills in trapeze, juggling, wire-walking, clowning, tumbling and teamwork. One-ring shows are thriving, from the highly profitable Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil to local productions, such as Circus Flora in St. Louis. \n\nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale du Cirque estimates that over 90%  of the American population lives within an hour's drive of a circus. The upcoming Smithsonian Folklife Festival will celebrate circus arts on the Washington, D. C. Mall in June and July.\n\nIn spite of periodic tragedy and economic hardship, the Big Show always endured because of its capacity for adaptation. At the turn of the 20th century, an era before the ascendency of film, radio, television, air travel and the Internet, the circus was the nation's most popular form of entertainment.\n\nTowns shut down as thousands of people left school and work to experience a sensory consortium of people and animals from around the world performing feats of strength, agility, speed, and flight. In that era, the extraordinary operating costs of moving and housing over 1,000 workers, hundreds of animals and supplies were profitably recovered by robust ticket sales.  \n\nToday, attendance figures at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus have plummeted into economically unsustainable territory over the past decade. The two separate units of the sprawling three-ring circus still travel by rail and collectively employ 500 people, most of whom will lose their jobs.\n\nAlthough the show eventually retired its elephants last May in response to sustained protests from animal rights activists, the continued presence of other captive animals remained controversial. Further, Kenneth Feld claims that the circus indelibly shaped the operations of his other live entertainment units in monster trucks and arena supercross motorcycle shows. But the profusion of  \"Globe of Steel\" motorcycle cage performances at the circus suggests that these motorized shows have influenced the circus at the expense of fewer muscle-powered acts. \n\nFinally, in a three-ring world of frenzied popular culture, the three-ring circus has become simply too wearying for a society perpetually bombarded by media. The demise of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus is both economic and cultural; the gargantuan three-ring \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" has lost its cultural footing.\n\nBut the perilous standing of the Big Apple Circus, which hopes to reorganize and reopen, is primarily financial. Lauded throughout its history, the beloved circus offers audiences an intimate one-ring experience celebrating individual artistry, similar to popular European circuses. But like other cherished local institutions, the Big Apple Circus is being priced out of existence in the Big Apple.\n\nTrue to the countercultural vision of its founders, Paul Binder and Michael Christensen, the nonprofit circus kept ticket prices affordable and continued its vibrant tradition of community service, offering free charity shows and programs for sick, infirmed and impoverished people. But this generosity of spirit has left the circus vulnerable.\n\nBefore the Great Recession, the Big Apple Circus earned a steady income from private performances. But after 2008, these events have disappeared. The Big Apple Circus filed for bankruptcy on November 20, 2016. If the circus is to survive, it may have to relocate away from its unaffordable namesake home. \n\nThe Big Apple Circus' specific economic circumstances are grave, but its birth in 1977 paved the way for today's one-ring circus renaissance.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the entertainment industry will grow roughly 6% in the next decade.   Although Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil faced a dip in ticket sales after the 2008 financial crisis, the show is expanding in the United States and around the world. Cirque du Soleil employs over 1,300 performers in 19 shows and it expects to hire 450 new artists each year: 100 newcomers will work on two to eight new projects annually in development. The remaining 350 will replace retiring performers in extant productions.\n\nAccording to Cirque casting director Pavel Kotov, the show intends to hire American talent for its American-based units. Cirque du Soleil, like other successful shows, is in a perpetual state of adaptation.\n\nIn an atomized world of stationary social media, the circus offers an unmediated, kinetic community experiences in real time. The success of the circus has always been defined by its ability to respond to changing social, cultural, and economic conditions. The looming end of two-storied American circuses offers a cautionary tale on the consequences of deflecting, rather than embracing, change.

Now they're Barb, Tammy and Dianne and Heidi,\" Mikulski mused in an interview with CNN.\n\nIn 1986, when she was first elected, women weren't allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor. They lacked a proper bathroom. And, there were only two female senators then -- Mikulski and Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat is now leaving as one of 20 female senators -- a bipartisan group that Mikulski is the unofficial dean of, gathering them all for monthly dinners.\n\n\"We disagreed on issues, but what we said was, No. 1, we were going to be a zone of civility even when we disagreed,\" she said.\n\nMikulski is the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress. Still, talking to us in one of her final interviews as a sitting senator, she made clear that she is retiring with unexpected sadness. On a scale of 1-10, she said her disappointment was a 52 on election night, after her old Senate colleague failed to become the first female president.\n\nAt first Mikulski demurred when asked whether America was just not ready for a female president, responding that she will \"let the history books write about that.\"\n\nWhen pressed, she said of Hillary Clinton: \"There were a lot of biases against her.\"\n\n\"You know what we find when you break the glass ceiling? You end up living in a glass office. Where everything you do is scrutinized,\" she said.\n\nIt's not just Mikulski's feminism that makes Clinton's defeat so crushing. It is that her own Democratic Party lost touch with the kind of working-class voters she says she never stopped fighting for.\n\n\"People right now in Baltimore that have three part-time jobs,\" said Mikulski. \"Many of my constituents fear that they're either losing their job overseas or they could lose it to a robot.\"\n\nWhen we suggested that she sounded a lot like Donald Trump, without missing a beat she replied: \"No. I think I sound like Barbara Mikulski.\"               \n\nShe admits the election results makes it tougher to leave, worried a lot of her work -- on Obamacare and beyond -- may be undone.\n\n\"You cannot take a wrecking ball to the very agencies that are designed to help American workers get on their feet,\" she said.\n\nStill, the first woman to ever chair the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee says that behind the scenes bipartisanship she witnessed and engaged in gives her hope.\n\nIn fact, with her offices already all packed up, our interview took place inside the historic appropriations room on the first floor of the Capitol, where she said she was part of many legislative efforts across the partisan aisle.\n\nEven the way senators sit at the imposing table -- with the chairman and the ranking member sitting side by side in the middle -- is aimed at a goal \"not to square off.\"\n\n\"We sit together,\" she said, standing over the side-by-side name plates of senators from opposing parties.\n\n\"This is symbolic and an actual function of civility where side-by-side we bring our members together for thoughtful discussion thoughtful analysis,\" said Mikulski.\n\nIt's that kind of quiet, unsung bipartisan work that she says she will miss.\n\n\"What I won't miss is the crazy partisan prickliness, and this loss of civility, and the fact that we don't take the time to listen to our constituents or to listen to each other. And how we can solve problems in a practical, affordable kind of way?\" she said.\n\nThe 4' 11\" tall senator, first elected to the House in 1976 and then the Senate in 1986, made a long career out of people underestimating her.\n\n\"I bring my own stool to have a longitudinal parity. It's not easy to be 4'11\" in an institution like this,\" she quipped.\n\nShe has a reputation for churning out quotable nuggets like that, but also for being intimidating at times -- making male colleagues cower, which she is quick to dismiss.\n\n\"I've heard of this one before. And I think that when women are persistent and insistent we're viewed as tough. Now, I view it as just being effective,\" she said.\n\nShe should know about persistence. She recalls one of her first legislative fights early in her career for parity for women when it came to medical research.\n\n\"We got money for a famous hormone study that changed medical practice and has reduced breast cancer rates by 15% of the strength,\" she said.\n\nOne of her proudest achievements was shepherding through the Senate the so-called Lilly Ledbetter legislation, aimed at giving women equal pay for equal work. It was the first bill enacted into law by the first black president, and he gave her the first pen he used to sign it. Now, it's the end of the Obama AND the Mikulski eras.\n\nAs the trailblazing senator walked out the door dropping pearls of wisdom, she did something rarely seen in public: She choked up remembering the evening of 9/11, when lawmakers came together to sing \"God Bless America\" on the Capitol steps.\n\n\"Regardless of who is president, we need to be able to stand on those steps and sing 'God Bless America' and feel the people in this Congress to come together and put the national interests above any party interest. We take an oath to the Constitution. I've never took an oath to the Democratic Party. I'm a strong Democrat but I believe in a credible country first, and always listen to the people,\" said Mikulski, ever and always the granddaughter Polish immigrants, and daughter of a working-class grocer. \"They really do have the best ideas.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.813835203647614, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 887, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.22680885708, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214120000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.0293122886133, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/20/opinions/how-trump-should-respond-to-hostage-appeal-bergen/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "How Trump can respond to US hostage appeal", "wordcount_as_scraped": 518, "date": "20161220210000", "story_content": "In an unprecedented public appeal to an incoming president, kidnapped American citizen Caitlin Coleman addressed President-elect Donald Trump directly in a video, urging him to secure the release of her and her family.\n\nThe video, released Monday by the Taliban, underlines the continuing plight of Coleman, 31, and her Canadian husband, Joshua Boyle, 33, who have been held captive in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region for more than four years. \n\nThe video shows Coleman and Boyle as well as their two young sons, who were born in captivity and are now toddlers. It is the first time there has been a \"proof of life\" of the children. \n\nOne of the boys sucks on a pacifier while his mother addresses the camera. Coleman, wearing a black burqa, speaks clearly and forcedly, saying: \"Today is December 3, 2016. We have waited since 2012 for somebody to understand our problems, the Kafkaesque nightmare in which we find ourselves.\" \n\nColeman and Boyle were kidnapped in Afghanistan in 2012 while on a backpacking trip.\n\nIn the video, Coleman addresses President Barack Obama, saying, \"Your legacy on leaving office is probably important to you,\" and she urges him to act to secure her family's release.\n\nColeman also addresses the President-elect, saying that the Haqqanis \"are not going to simply release our family easily, because it is correct. They want money, power and friends. ... We are told there are Afghans who are prisoners in Kabul that these men care about.\"\n\nThis is a reference to Anas Haqqani, the brother of the head of the Haqqani terrorist organization, who is in an Afghan prison. Haqqani was arrested in 2014, and an Afghan court convicted him in August of raising money for the group.\n\nThe Haqqanis have threatened to kill Coleman and Boyle if the Afghan government carries out the death sentence it has imposed on Anas Haqqani. \n\nThe United States and Canada have an opportunity to secure the release of Coleman, Boyle and their sons by interceding with the Afghan government to negotiate an exchange for Anas Haqqani, who is not regarded as a leader of the Haqqani Network.\n\nThe incoming Trump administration will have tremendous leverage over the Afghan government, which is hoping for a continued American presence in the country. \n\nBut it is not just Coleman and her family who are being held. \n\nAt a Pentagon briefing this month, Gen. John Nicholson, the overall commander of US forces in Afghanistan, said that the Haqqanis are holding five Americans. Those Americans are Coleman and her two sons; Kevin King, a professor who was kidnapped in Kabul in August; and another American whose name is being withheld by CNN at the request of his family. \n\nThe Haqqanis are also holding Boyle and an Australian who was abducted in Kabul in August.\n\nDonald Trump prides himself on the art of the deal. With that in mind, he should use the leverage he has to secure the release of the American and other Western hostages held by the Haqqanis in exchange for Anas Haqqani.\n\nIt's long past time for all these men, women and children to be returned home.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.2847099304199197, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 519, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.05865524387, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.43159922928709, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/08/europe/uk-mi6-alex-younger-syria-russia-aleppo/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 555, "scraper_regex": 775}}, "headline": "UK spy chief warns of Russia's role in Syria 'tragedy'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 775, "date": "20161208160000", "story_content": "The head of Britain's foreign spy service, Alex Younger, warned of Russia's role in the \"unfolding tragedy\" in Syria in a rare public speech Thursday at the agency's headquarters in London. \n\nYounger, head of the Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6, said Russia and the Syrian regime were working to wipe out opposition in Aleppo at any price.\n\n\"In Aleppo, Russia and the Syrian regime seek to make a desert and call it peace. The human tragedy is heartbreaking,\" he said.\n\nYounger was the first serving MI6 chief to make such a public speech inside the agency's landmark headquarters on the south bank of the River Thames. \n\nThe speech was an attempt to open up a service that operates largely in the shadows, yet is accountable to taxpayers and is facing calls for greater transparency.\n\nBut the event was nevertheless restricted: a small group of reporters were picked up at a pre-arranged location in central London and taken to MI6 headquarters with nothing but a notepad to record the speech -- electronic devices were banned.\n\nAddressing the reporters, Younger said that Russian and Syrian actions, in defiance of the international community, put the broader global fight against extremism at risk.\n\n\"I believe the Russian conduct in Syria, allied with that of (Bashar al-Assad's) discredited regime, will, if they do not change course, provide a tragic example of the perils of forfeiting legitimacy,\" he said.\n\n\"In defining as a terrorist anyone who opposes a brutal government, they alienate precisely that group that has to be on side if the extremists are to be defeated.\"\n\nYounger, whose code name is \"C\" and who only writes in green pen, leads Britain's fight against terrorism around the world -- and the conflicts in Iraq and Syria are at the top of the list.  \n\nHe said Britain cannot be safe from threats in the region unless the civil war in Syria is brought to an end -- \"and brought to an end in a way that recognizes the interests of more than a minority of its people and their international backers.\"\n\nHow will Brexit, Trump affect security?\n\nYounger also addressed concerns that European security could be at greater risk once the United Kingdom leaves the European Union and US President-elect Donald Trump enters the White House. \n\nThe UK works closely with French and German secret services and is America's closest intelligence-sharing partner.\n\nUK agencies must work within domestic law. But during the presidential campaign, Trump touted the benefits of waterboarding, which is outlawed in Britain. President Barack Obama has banned these tactics, which are against international law. \n\nYounger said he did not expect much change under the new US presidency and in a post-Brexit world.\n\n\"I'm often asked what effect the big political changes of 2016 -- Brexit and the US election result -- will have on these relationships,\" he said.\n\n\"My answer is that I will aim for, and expect, continuity. These relationships are long lasting, and the personal bonds between us are strong.\"\n\nThreat of hybrid warfare\n\nYounger also highlighted the \"increasingly dangerous phenomenon of hybrid warfare,\" in what could be interpreted as a reference on Russia's alleged cyber interference in last month's US election.\n\n\"The connectivity that is at the heart of globalisation can be exploited by States with hostile intent to further their aims deniably,\" he said.  \"They do this through means as varied as cyber-attacks, propaganda or subversion of democratic process.\"\n\nMI6 must do what it can to uncover these activities and help the UK government and its allies defend against them, Younger said. \n\n\"The risks at stake are profound and represent a fundamental threat to our sovereignty; they should be a concern to all those who share democratic values.\"\n\nBond 'created powerful brand' for MI6\n\nYounger is described as a career intelligence officer who led counterterror operations during the 2012 London Olympics. He has held various overseas postings, most notably as the ranking officer in Afghanistan. \n\nDespite the whiff of James Bond about him, Younger said he was conflicted by the portrayal of the service in popular culture. \n\n\"Bond has created a powerful brand for MI6 -- as C, the real-life M -- there are few people who will not come to lunch if I invite them,\" he said. \n\nBut he said Bond -- or 007 -- wouldn't get a job in today's MI6. \"For too long,\" said Younger, \"people have felt that there is a certain single quality that defines an MI6 officer, be it an Oxbridge education or a proficiency in hand-to-hand combat.\n\n\"This is, of course, patently untrue. There is no standard MI6 officer.

More recently, President-elect Donald Trump was even more successful in employing even more sweeping assurances about, as he put it, \"draining the swamp.\" \n\nIf only it were so easy. Unfortunately, governing is different from making promises on the campaign trail. As Obama and others have found, these particular problems -- of influence peddling -- are deeply entrenched.\n\nAnd this time, the distance between the candidate's promises and his actions post-election is looking more like a chasm. The shock and concern about Trump's break with decades of US foreign policy to speak with Taiwan's President was compounded by the revelation that it resulted from six months and $140,000 worth of behind-the-scenes work by former Sen. Bob Dole, now a lobbyist for the law firm Alston & Bird. \n\nBut far more than the lobbyists and insiders who make it a challenge for anyone to \"drain the swamp,\" it's Trump himself, and his massive portfolio of investments, that threatens to torpedo his pledge. The sheer size, scale and breadth of his holdings at home and abroad is so overwhelming, it would be more surprising if at some point conflicts of interest didn't arise. \n\nWe already have every reason to be cautious and vigilant about the influence that Trump's investments and business partners (particularly foreign business partners) may have on shaping US policy; his business interests touch at least 18 countries that we know about. It doesn't take much imagination to see how the opportunity to use policy decisions to benefit financially might be easily rationalized.\n\nNow add Trump's disinclination toward transparency. While all presidential candidates, including Trump, are required to file personal financial disclosure reports, those forms don't present a complete picture. He has said many times that he's worth around $10 billion. To verify this, we would need to see his tax returns, which, unlike all other presidential nominees of the last 40 years, he has refused to release.\n\nNevertheless, Trump is a very, very wealthy man -- worth around $3.7 billion, according to Forbes.  And like many of the ultra-rich, his holdings are very, very complicated. The resorts, hotels, businesses, investments and other trappings of wealth (like homes, planes and helicopters) are held in trusts within trusts, like Russian nesting dolls. Tough to map it all out, even for an investigative journalist or private investigator, much less the average American trying to understand where his commitments lie and to whom he might be beholden.\n\nAnd those are the \"known unknowns.\" What about the unknown unknowns? Are there business commitments, debts or ethical compromises involving Trump, his companies or his children that we are completely in the dark about? \n\nIf he is unwilling to divest his business or put everything in a blind trust, will questions about potential self-dealing continue to dog his administration and distract from his successes? Could foreign governments have damaging information about his dealings that he would not want disclosed publicly; information they could use as leverage in negotiations? \n\nIf Trump refuses to fully and meaningfully divest, are Americans then forced to place trust in him completely, ceding our ability and right to verify that he is advancing the public and national interest ahead of his own? \n\nAnd what if he does divest -- shouldn't that also extend to his children? Even if he transfers all control of his conglomerate to them, what changes?  He may be less distracted by the business, but no less partial to its success. The very same potential for priorities that are skewed to favor Trump holdings, and the potential for those concerns to undermine US policy, will continue to exist.\n\nTrump's nominees for top government posts are raising similar concerns. Like Trump, many of them are multimillionaires and billionaires, the latest including yet another Goldman Sachs financier, Gary Cohn, for National Economic Council, and Rex Tillerson, the head of ExxonMobil, for the State Department. Everyone is focused on whether they, too, will bring conflicts of interest too difficult to parse. \n\nAren't all these elites, many of them major political donors, creatures of the swamp Trump was supposed to drain?\n\nTo make sense of all of this, we will require information,  information that Trump has been loath to provide. Love him or hate him, we need public pressure on Trump and his administration to be transparent, and diligent probing of documents and sources by researchers and journalists (like ours at OpenSecrets.org) to know whether the swamp is actually getting more crowded.\n\nWe think Trump must divest his business, but we're in uncharted territory, so perhaps reasonable people can disagree. But one thing is certain: If Trump does not divest, his business becomes our business. We won't see any of the financial benefits, but our nation will reap the consequences nonetheless.

Steven King struck a strident tone while discussing immigration policy on Thursday, saying \"there are some awfully bad people\" among the so-called \"dreamers\" that President Barack Obama is protecting from deportation.\n\n\"When you look at this, I think that there's been such a hard push on this. The reason they're called 'dreamers' because that's the most sympathetic term that could be apply applied to people,\" the Iowa Republican said in an interview on CNN's \"New Day.\"\n\n\"Among all of these dreamers, there are some awfully bad people. And these dreamers go on up to the age of 37 or 38 or maybe older. And that's if they tell the truth.\"\n\nMayors ask Trump to reconsider DACA stance\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has said he will terminate DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an executive action signed into law by Obama in 2012 that gives some undocumented immigrants an exemption from deportation and a renewable two-year work permit. Among the guidelines, the policy states that applicants must have come to the United States before they turned 16 years old, must have been in the States since June 15, 2007, and cannot have been convicted of certain crimes.\n\nPressed for an example of those \"awfully bad people,\" King didn't offer any specifics, but pointed to his experience from trips to the border where he said he'd seen \"young men\" smuggling drugs.\n\n\"I've spent a fair amount of time down at the border. I've been down there and helped arrest people that are smuggling drugs in,\" he said. \"I have watched as these packs of marijuana are on the backs of young men that are walking across the border.\"\n\n\"You think those drug traffickers are what are referred to as the dreamers who were brought here against their will as minors, and now go to school here and have jobs?\" host Alisyn Camerota asked.\n\nKing pushed back. \"Wait, wait, wait -- this definition of about 'against their will -- that's a made up term,\" he said. \n\n\"Did any of those little kids say I didn't want to come here? Or did any of them that came in the day before they turned 18, they qualify too, did they say I was brought here against my will? No. Some of them are walking across the border on their own, lots of them,\" he said. \n\n\"They know what they're doing, it's not against their will,\" King added. \"And they came here to live in the shadows. So, if we enforce the law and they live in the shadows, that's what they came here to do.\"\n\nCamerota pressed King on whether he would support allowing children under age 10, for example, to stay. \"Did they come of their own free will?\" she asked. \n\n\"Let's ask their parents. Will those children point to their parents, and tell us you really need to enforce the law against my parents? Because they know what they were doing when they caused me to break the law. I don't think we've thought through this very well,\" he answered. \n\nKing explained that \"I don't want to let this go because somebody's heart got a little softer than it was before the election.\"\n\nThe Iowa representative -- one of the most outspoken voices on immigration in the Republican conference -- also staked out an aggressive position on Trump's proposed border wall, saying he wanted concrete wall with extensive security features covering the entire U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nKing said that proposals for a \"virtual\" wall based on a mixture of fencing, technology, and funding increases -- something Rep. Dennis Ross (R-FL) pitched to Bloomberg News -- would not be acceptable.\n\n\"I would say to my friend Dennis, that's, you know, that's news speak. When you say a wall's not a wall, then what is anything anything?\" he said. \"When you say a wall, you mean a wall. You want to build a fence, you say fence. You don't use it a euphemism for a virtual -- say, surveillance from hot air balloons that are floating over the border.\"\n\nKing called for a wall \"made out of concrete. And, I'm calling upon President-elect Trump to not just settle for a wall, let's build a fence, then a wall, then a fence, so we create two no man's lands, one on either side of the wall. When we pick people up there they don't really have an excuse.

But this new year, the world witnessed a kinder, gentler Putin -- a leader who at his annual state of the nation address in early December insisted: \"We are not seeking and have never sought enemies. We need friends.\"\n\nSome in the West claim it's real -- or at least hope it is, a chance to set relations back on track with a Russian leader who sees the incoming US president, Donald Trump, as a potential partner.\n\nPutin's geopolitical judo\n\nOthers see in Putin's charm offensive evidence of \"asymmetric diplomacy:\" unpredictable geopolitical moves by a black belt judo master, designed to keep his opponents off guard.\n\nFor example, look at Putin's hip throw of President Barack Obama last week. In an effort to punish Russia over alleged hacking in the United States election and to avert future cyberattacks, Obama invoked sanctions against Russia's top intelligence officials and expelled Russian diplomats from the US.\n\nEveryone expected a tit-for-tat response from Putin. Then, in a dramatic piece of political theater, he said he wouldn't expel anybody. Instead, he kindly invited the children of Moscow-based American diplomats to a Christmas and New Year celebration at the Kremlin, effectively painting Obama as the Grinch who stole Christmas.\n\nOne of Putin's first forays into asymmetry was during the Crimea crisis in 2014. Instead of deploying its military forces in an open show of defiance, Moscow sent well-trained troops -- without insignia -- into Ukraine, dubbing them \"polite people.\"  \n\nThe expression, with its tongue-in-cheek flavor, soon ended up on T-shirts for sale in Moscow, a point of pride for Russians eager to see their boys pull one over on the West.\n\nSyria: Who's caught in a quagmire?\n\nIn September 2015, Putin again caught the US off guard when he sent military fighter jets to Syria in the first major deployment outside the former Soviet space that Moscow had undertaken since its war in Afghanistan.\n\nRussian officials, at first, described it as a \"defensive\" move, but it soon became apparent it was far more: a major effort to prevent the collapse of the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nObama predicted Putin would be caught in a \"quagmire,\" but Moscow's carefully crafted incursion, with massive air power and virtually no ground troops, enabled Syrian forces to capture the key city of Aleppo.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama's attempts to separate the \"moderate\" Syrian opposition from ISIS and other terrorist groups was caught in its own quagmire as Russian and Syrian government forces carried out a relentless but effective bombing campaign. Soon, the President-elect, Trump, said he was willing to cooperate with Putin in fighting the No. 1 enemy: international terrorism.\n\nOnce again, Obama was elbowed aside as the Russian leader reached around him to grasp Trump's hand. Trump even raised the possibility of joining Russia in supporting the Assad government. \"Syria is fighting ISIS,\" he said,  \"and you have to get rid of ISIS.\"\n\nFrom anti-Americanism to anti-Obamaism\n\nPutin, his top officials and his state-controlled media have employed asymmetric techniques at home in a quick pivot from rabid anti-Americanism to rabid anti-Obamaism. That strategy could make it easier to prepare the Russian public for a cozier relationship with the United States under a Trump administration -- if Trump can follow through on his desire to make a \"deal\" with Putin. \n\nAs Putin plays good cop, his senior officials demean Obama as a failure who tried to harm Russia.\n\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has lambasted Obama's team as \"a group of foreign policy losers, bitter and narrow-minded.\" \n\n\"... (T)he American people were humiliated by their own president,\" she said. \"Not by international terrorists, not by enemy troops. This time Washington was slapped by (its) own master, who has complicated the urgent tasks for the incoming team in the extreme.\"\n\nThe Russian Embassy in London even tweeted a drawing of a duck with the word \"lame\" plastered across its chest. \"Everybody, including [the American] people, will be glad to the see last of this hapless [Administration],\" it read.\n\nPresident Obama expels 35 \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa diplomats in Cold War deja vu. As everybody, incl \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 people, will be glad to see the last of this hapless Adm. pic.twitter.com/mleqA16H8D\u2014 Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) December 29, 2016\n\nIn another technique for putting his opponent off-balance, Putin has denied, in general terms, accusations of Russian hacking in the US election, but subtly tweaking Obama and Democrats, telling the Bloomberg news agency: \"Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data? The important thing is the content that was given to the public.\"\n\nPutin has tried to leverage US democracy against itself, criticizing the Electoral College system of deciding elections. \"There is no true democracy there,\" he said at the Valdai Discussion Club, \"and you are trying to convince us that we are not (democratic)?\"\n\nAs he assumes the presidency, will Trump see Putin's \"asymmetric diplomacy\" for what it is?\n\nBehind the judo moves, Putin is hampered by an economy hit hard by depressed oil prices and by Western economic sanctions. His charm offensive with Trump may last only as long as he thinks he can get what he wants from the new US President. \n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly described Putin's role at the KGB.

Troy Gilbert -- for the third time.\n\nTen years ago, Troy was flying in the skies over Iraq when he received a distress call about a Special Operations unit whose helicopter had crashed and was now being ambushed by enemy forces.\n\nHis wingman had flown off to refuel and the friendly forces on the ground were too close to the enemy to safely drop a bomb. So he flew dangerously low, strafing the enemy with his Gatling gun. \n\n\"(Troy) wasn't going to look like he was doing something, he was actually going to do something,\" Ginger said.  \n\nOne pass went as planned and he took out an enemy truck. But on his next pass, he couldn't pull the jet up in time and it crashed. Troy died instantly. \n\nAir Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, who led the investigation into Troy's crash, said he wrote the accident report knowing Troy's children would read it one day.\n\n\"(Troy) was so intensely focused on taking that target out, saving American lives, that he didn't give himself enough room for the recovery,\" Goldfein told CNN's Barbara Starr. \n\nTroy left behind Ginger and their five children, including twin six-month-old girls. \n\n'Something terrible had happened'\n\nThe knock at the door came without warning.\n\n\"I just looked out and saw that sea of blue Air Force uniforms,\" Ginger said, \"And I looked at their faces and I knew something terrible had happened.\" \n\nNot only had Troy been killed in action, but the family learned that insurgents had found his body, taken it and used it in online propaganda videos. \n\nScouring the crash site, investigators were able to recover skull fragments that they identified through DNA as his. Ginger decided to hold his 2006 funeral with a full-sized, but empty, coffin. \n\nYears passed. As propaganda video continued to surface, the family fought to scrub them from the Internet. Meanwhile, Ginger still pushed the Air Force to find Troy's body -- all of it.\n\nDuring that time, the family found ways to remember Troy. On the anniversary of his death, they make his favorite food -- brownies -- and release balloons with hand-written messages on them. \n\nA few years ago, someone turned over some bones from Troy's toes to the Jordanian Embassy in Baghdad. After another DNA confirmation, the family held funeral number two in 2013.\n\n\"It was very spiritually symbolic to me that all we had was the very top of his head and the very tip of his toes,\" Ginger said. \n\nThere were days she thought they'd never recover the rest of him, but in August, Ginger finally received the phone call she had been waiting for.\n\nShe was informed that \"Troy's been found. And I was ... I was blown away,\" she said, her voice breaking.\n\nThe very same unit Troy had saved recovered his body in Iraq after a local warlord claimed he had it. \n\n A new beginning\n\nGinger's strong faith was shaken by Troy's loss, but her spirits were boosted by an email a stranger wrote about his wife's battle with breast cancer that was forwarded to her. \n\nShe tracked the couple down and traded emails with them. They helped each other cope.\n\nThe wife eventually passed away, and when Ginger by chance was spending the holidays near the couple's home, she arranged to meet the widower, Jim Ravella, face to face.\n\nEventually, their mutual grief turned to love and they wed a few months later. He adopted all five Gilbert children on Memorial Day in 2009.\n\nJim not only understood what Ginger was going through, he understood Troy. \n\nHimself a retired Air Force pilot who flew F-15s, Jim was able to follow the crash report like few others could.\n\nThe couple is now writing a book about faith, loss and love. They work together for Folds of Honor, a charity that helps children who have lost a parent receive an education. As part of that, Ginger tells Troy's story to audiences across the country. \n\n\"Gold Star families, we just want their name to still be spoken and their lives to still be relevant,\" Ginger explained. \"And his life is very relevant, very relevant. He's still helping people. Which is exactly what he wanted to be doing.\"\n\nThe family periodically watches a 90-minute video Troy recorded in Iraq just before he died. On it, he reads Bible verses to the children, tells them how much he loves them and promises to return home.\n\nWhile it won't be the reunion they all imagined, after 10 years, his homecoming will finally happen.

Facing riots and revolt, Tsar Nicolas II abdicated his throne and along with his family, the last tsar of Russia was brutally executed the following year. \n\nLenin and Stalin were leaders of the Bolshevik Revolution, forming a provisional government that would later become the USSR. \n\nOther prominent names from early 20th century Russia feature on the site including the artist Kazimir Malevich, the author Vladimir Nabokov and ballerina Anna Pavlova.\n\nRussians are not the only nationality to feature -- Rudyard Kipling, Pablo Picasso and George V all play a prominent role too.\n\nEach character has his or her own page and all of the information has been compiled from letters, memoirs, diaries and other documents from the era.\n\nZygar explained: \"There is no ability to skip days, events unfold in real time.\"\n\nFor example, on Thursday December 1, 1916 we find Lenin posting from Zurich in Switzerland where he was still in exile at that time. The post shows him discussing the Communist Manifesto.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile Tsar Nicholas II is also posting messages. He appears to be far from worried about an impending revolution, instead posting about his daily routine.\n\nOn December 3, 1916 he \"writes\" about his breakfast, a farewell to an English Admiral and taking a family member to a train station.\n\nWhen history and art collide\n\nZygar, the former editor-in-chief of TV Rain, Russia's only independent television channel, explained that the purpose of the project was to \"use social media not as service but as a generator of art. To revolutionize the way of learning and teaching history.\"\n\nBut the project was not created for schools. Instead Zygar describes it as \"educa-ment\" -- a mix of education and entertainment, aimed at a much broader audience.\n\n\"You can watch it as a TV show, day by day, waiting for something new and interesting to happen to your new friends.\"\n\nWhen asked if he felt there would be an element of nostalgia from people, he said: \"It's obviously not about nostalgia because no one is feeling nostalgic about what happened 100 years ago. 1917 is the highest peak of Russian culture and civil society. It is the best and most tragic moment of Russian history.\"\n\nZygar adds: \"The project does not have any other motive but \"it's for the audience to decide what conclusion they are going to make. Do they think the middle class of 1917 resembled middle class of 2017?\" \n\nAn English version of the site will due to be launched in early next year and run through until January 18 2018 --\u00a0the date the new government formed a century earlier\u00a0and, as Zygar calls it, \"the day of the death of Russian democracy.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.4622496068477629, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 575, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.7814470856599998, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.08695652173913, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/donald-trump-intelligence-report-russia/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 942, "scraper_regex": 1012}}, "headline": "Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1012, "date": "20170111000000", "story_content": "Classified documents presented last week to President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings tell CNN. \n\nThe allegations were presented in a two-page synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.  The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible.  The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump.\n\nThe classified briefings last week were presented by four of the senior-most US intelligence chiefs -- Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers.\n\nOne reason the nation's intelligence chiefs took the extraordinary step of including the synopsis in the briefing documents was to make the President-elect aware that such allegations involving him are circulating among intelligence agencies, senior members of Congress and other government officials in Washington, multiple sources tell CNN.\n\nThese senior intelligence officials also included the synopsis to demonstrate that Russia had compiled information potentially harmful to both political parties, but only released information damaging to Hillary Clinton and Democrats.  This synopsis was not an official part of the report from the intelligence community case about Russian hacks, but some officials said it augmented the evidence that Moscow intended to harm Clinton's candidacy and help Trump's, several officials with knowledge of the briefings tell CNN.\n\nThe two-page synopsis also included allegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government, according to two national security officials. \n\nSources tell CNN that these same allegations about communications between the Trump campaign and the Russians, mentioned in classified briefings for congressional leaders last year, prompted then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid to send a letter to FBI Director Comey in October, in which he wrote, \"It has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government -- a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States.\" \n\nCNN has confirmed that the synopsis was included in the documents that were presented to Mr. Trump but cannot confirm if it was discussed in his meeting with the intelligence chiefs. \n\nThe Trump transition team declined repeated requests for comment. \n\nAppearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, dismissed the memos, as unverified and untrue. \n\nCNN has reviewed a 35-page compilation of the memos, from which the two-page synopsis was drawn. The memos have since been published by Buzzfeed. The memos originated as opposition research, first commissioned by anti-Trump Republicans, and later by Democrats.  At this point, CNN is not reporting on details of the memos, as it has not independently corroborated the specific allegations. But, in preparing this story, CNN has spoken to multiple high ranking intelligence, administration, congressional and law enforcement officials, as well as foreign officials and others in the private sector with direct knowledge of the memos.\n\nRussia denies having \"Kompromat\" on Donald Tump\n\nSome of the memos were circulating as far back as last summer.  What has changed since then is that US intelligence agencies have now checked out the former British intelligence operative and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough to include some of the information in the presentations to the President and President-elect a few days ago.\n\nOn the same day that the President-elect was briefed by the intelligence community, the top four Congressional leaders, and chairmen and ranking members of the  House and Senate intelligence committees -- the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" --  were also provided a summary of the memos regarding Mr. Trump, according to law enforcement, intelligence and administration sources. \n\nThe two-page summary was written without the detailed specifics and information about sources and methods included in the memos by the former British intelligence official. That said, the synopsis was considered so sensitive it was not included in the classified report about Russian hacking that was more widely distributed, but rather in an annex only shared at the most senior levels of the government:  President Obama, the President-elect, and the eight Congressional leaders.\n\nCNN has also learned that on December 9, Senator John McCain gave a full copy of the memos -- dated from June through December, 2016 -- to FBI Director James Comey.  McCain became aware of the memos from a former British diplomat who had been posted in Moscow.  But the FBI had already been given a set of the memos compiled up to August 2016, when the former MI6 agent presented them to an FBI official in Rome, according to national security officials. \n\nThe raw memos on which the synopsis is based were prepared by the former MI6 agent, who was posted in Russia in the 1990s and now runs a private intelligence gathering firm.  His investigations related to Mr. Trump were initially funded by groups and donors supporting Republican opponents of Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries, multiple sources confirmed to CNN.  Those sources also said that once Mr. Trump became the nominee, further investigation was funded by groups and donors supporting Hillary Clinton.  \n\nSpokespeople for the FBI and the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. Officials who spoke to CNN declined to do so on the record given the classified nature of the material.  \n\nSome of the allegations were first reported publicly in Mother Jones one week before the election.\n\nOne high level administration official told CNN, \"I have a sense the outgoing administration and intelligence community is setting down the pieces so this must be investigated seriously and run down. I think [the] concern was to be sure that whatever information was out there is put into the system so it is evaluated as it should be and acted upon as necessary.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.39254170656204207, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 942, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.52324043183, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.7600849256900197, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/07/politics/syria-damascus-us-election/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [539, 701, 1919, 2684, 3308]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 887, "scraper_regex": 980}}, "headline": "The other side of Syria's war: Damascus students eye US election", "wordcount_as_scraped": 980, "date": "20161107180000", "story_content": "Every Thursday in the Syrian capital, a group of 9th graders meet for a debate club with a difference.\n\nThese teenage students at Damascus' French school live in relative calm in the government-controlled city, while much of their country is engulfed in a brutal civil war.\n\nOnce a week, their attention is focused thousands of miles away as they discuss the race for the White House with their English teacher -- an American who has lived in Damascus for more than 40 years.\u00a0\n\nNew York State-born Thomas Webber says all the Syrians he knows are following this US election closely.\n\nLast 'True American' in Damascus doesn't want to leave\u00a0\n\n''They are very well informed as they all know that Syria's future is in the hands of our new president.

The elections are very important to me, because they could affect my country as well, especially its security. The way we live in Syria depends on the new US president.''\n\nDebates\u00a0\n\nAsma, who recently returned to Damascus after four years in Canada and Lebanon, says she enjoys learning about politics and listening to the candidates' answers in the debates.\n\nHer 72-year-old teacher watched all the presidential debates, which started at 4 a.m. in Damascus, and has already cast his absentee ballot in the battleground state of Ohio where he is legally resident.\n\n\"So many people said it was the lesser of two evils.

They felt the election of the first female American president would show that there is ''no difference between men and women.''\u00a0\n\n''But it doesn't mean we don't like Trump,'' they added. ''We just think Clinton is better.''\n\nDirawi told CNN he hopes whoever wins will ''bring back security all over the world, and especially in America.''\n\nBut not everyone was so enthusiastic.\n\nReferencing Trump's call for a ban on Muslims entering the US, 14-year-old Dani Abouharb felt ''any candidate who has a lot of racism against Muslims and Arabs is not a good choice for Syria.''\n\nBeing Muslim American in the year of Donald Trump\n\nThe teenagers at the private Lycee Charles de Gaulle are the children of the Syrian capital's professional classes and high earners.\n\nWebber says most parents are successful business people, while others are part of the cultural elite.\n\nElsewhere in Syria ...\n\nThe students' expensive, uninterrupted education highlights the deep division in Syria after a grinding war that has left more than 250,000 people dead and millions more displaced inside and outside Syria's borders.\n\nMillions of children and teenagers are experiencing the war very differently depending on which part of the country they live in.\n\nThe United Nations and other international organizations speak of a ''lost generation'' of young Syrians growing up under the constant threat of regime airstrikes, in refugee camps or working instead of going to school.\n\nBut those growing up in the relatively stable government-controlled parts of Syria are experiencing some semblance of a normal childhood, although many also have to contend with regular rebel attacks.\n\nLittle boy in Aleppo a vivid reminder of war's horror\n\nThe United Nations estimates that 60% of the population in Syria live in areas controlled by the government.\n\n''We're just like everyone else,'' Asma Sukkar and her classmate Hassiba Nizameddin told CNN by video.\n\n''We don't live in ashes like people think. We have houses, we have roofs. We eat, study, sleep. We listen to music, watch TV, just like the rest of the world. Syrians are not different.''\n\nFor Webber, there is no contradiction between living and working in government-held Damascus and voting for a candidate who has been very critical of Syrian President Bashar al Assad and who advocates a no-fly zone in parts of the country.\n\n''She's talking hawkish but she's a dove inside,'' he told CNN, speaking by phone from Damascus.\n\n''It's not going to be her decision alone to do anything major in Syria, her activities will be controlled and influenced by the House, the Senate, her Secretary of State.'\n\n''I'm very proud that I made my vote in this very important election.

James Mattis to become his secretary of defense means that America's forgotten wars are finally being remembered, at least for a while.\n\nFor the second time in a row, America's longest war has been virtually invisible in the national conversation surrounding a presidential election. In 2012 and 2016, neither main party candidate wanted to discuss the fight in Afghanistan. And there was also little said about the future of US engagement in Iraq, aside from how it related to the battle against ISIS. It is as if the post-9/11 wars are now simply a kind of grim mood music for a conversation over the nation's future that has turned dark and full of concern.\n\nBut that could be set to change. \n\nFor the first time, one of the early military leaders of the post-9/11 wars looks poised to lead the Pentagon -- this time, as a civilian. The choice marks a break with America's tradition of civilian leadership of the military -- the National Security Act of 1947 stated: \"That a person who has within ten years been on active duty as a commissioned officer in a Regular component of the armed services shall not be eligible for appointment as Secretary of Defense.\" (Congress reduced this exclusion to seven in 2008.)\n\nBut if confirmed, Mattis -- who will never have forgotten those charged with doing the fighting in the post-9/11 wars -- would force Americans to confront these conflicts at a time when the United States has done a good job forgetting to feel like a country at war. \n\nIn his book \"The Generals,\" Tom Ricks quotes Nate Fick, then a young Marine officer, talking about finding Mattis in a fighting hole on the front lines in Afghanistan. \"No one would have questioned Mattis if he'd slept eight hours each night in a private room, to be woken each morning by an aide who ironed his uniforms and heated his MREs. But there he was, in the middle of a freezing night, out on the lines with his Marines,\" Fick is quoted as recalling.\n\nMattis led Marines at the very start of the war in Afghanistan. Reportedly a devotee of the book \"Good to Great,\" Mattis focused on getting the right people on his team and keeping his staff small. He earned, and earned again, the trust of those who served under him, who trusted him as a plain-talking and erudite leader steeped in military history and the classics.\n\nYet the military of which he was a part of from 1972 until 2013 has become an ever-smaller sliver of society, even as it is asked to do more -- and for longer. Only a tiny fraction of Americans has fought in US wars of the past 15 years, meaning much of the country is detached from the realities of conflict.\n\nThis point was underscored by Mattis and his co-editor Kori Schake in their recent book, \"Warriors and Citizens: American Views of Our Military.\"\n\n\"The American public used to have greater familiarity with military service because many more Americans were directly affected than are now,\" Mattis said in a September interview with RealClearDefense about the book. \"To many in the military, we seem to be not a country at war, but a military at war.\"\n\nThat \"military at war\" that Mattis referenced remains at war. Special operations forces continue to suffer combat losses, and military families are being changed forever, yet few in America are noticing.  Indeed, Navy SEALs, Green Berets, Army Rangers and all-female Cultural Support Team members who join the Rangers on nighttime combat operations, among others, are deployed in places such as Afghanistan even as you read this.\n\nAnd while the taxing nature of warfare hasn't changed, the faces of those tasked with fighting is poised to. Then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta officially lifted the ban on women in ground combat in 2013, paving the way for such roles to be opened to women this year. \n\nAlso this year, female West Point cadets could for the first time choose to enter combat arms jobs, including armor and the infantry. And finally, on the same day the story broke of the Mattis nomination, the first female soldiers graduated from the Army's Armor Basic Officer Leaders Course at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\nBut while these soldiers may have made history, that wasn't their goal. They wanted only to serve to their utmost. And they won over their instructors in the process.\n\n\"There was some skepticism at first, just to see can they do it ... but as soon as they started performing to those same standards -- because we didn't change anything and they performed to those same standards, and they met and exceeded those same standards -- it solidified that they have a place here,\" Staff Sgt. George Baker told reporters as the first gender-integrated class of Armor Basic Officer Leaders Course that graduated 53 male and 13 female officers concluded Thursday.\n\nThat skepticism may or may not be shared by Mattis, who has written and spoken at length about the need for \"a little more humility and a little more modesty on the part of those who may have statutory, legal, constitutional authority over the military, as they listen to (non-commissioned officers) and junior officers who will actually have the responsibility to try to create unit cohesion.\"\n\nHis words over the years have left many observers wondering whether the opening of all combat roles to women will be reversed with him at the helm of the Pentagon. But Mattis is a leader known for caring deeply about all those in uniform under his command, a leader who has focused a great deal on exploring and narrowing the gap between America's warriors and the country they serve. \n\nAll this suggests that as he embarks upon the path toward making history as the first post-9/11 military commander to lead the Pentagon, Mattis and his record of service will be a stark reminder to the country that it remains at war, even if it doesn't bother to notice. And if he is indeed confirmed, the history-making former general will find that much history has been made in the meantime by those wanting to contribute as much as they might to their nation's security.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.87511229515076, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1021, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 19, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 14, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.299678596030001, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 51, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161206180000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.995102840352599, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.63636363636}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/20/middleeast/syria-aleppo-airstrikes/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 838, "scraper_regex": 1223}}, "headline": "Syria: Aleppo pounded by 'heaviest bombardment' since war began", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1223, "date": "20161120210000", "story_content": "Syrian regime forces pounded eastern Aleppo with airstrikes for a sixth straight day Sunday, bringing the death toll to almost 300 in the most intense bombing since the war began five years ago, rescuers say. \n\nAmong the latest reported violence: a suspected chemical attack that killed four children and their parents. Two activist groups -- the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human rights and Aleppo Media Center -- said a barrage of barrel bombs struck their neighborhood, al-Sakhour. \n\nThe Syrian regime resumed heavy bombardment over eastern Aleppo on Tuesday after a three-week lull, killing at least 289 people by Saturday, according to the Syrian Civil Defense, also known as White Helmets. \n\n\"This is the heaviest bombardment I have seen in the past five years,\" said Ismail Abdallah from the White Helmets.\n\nAt a time when hospitals are desperately needed, few have withstood the relentless bombardment -- not a single one is operating at full capacity, the Syrian American Medical Society told CNN. \n\nUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the assault and \"indiscriminate shelling\" for killing and maiming scores of civilians, including children, and for leaving eastern Aleppo without a functioning hospital.\n\n\"The secretary-general reminds all parties to the conflict that targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure is a war crime,\" the statement said. \"Those responsible for these and other atrocities in Syria, whoever and wherever they are, must one day be brought to account.\"\n\nDisturbing video shows devastated family\n\nA video from the Aleppo Media Center shows the toll in one neighborhood. \n\nFive bodies -- three children, two adults -- are visible in the bed of a truck, covered in colorful blankets in the cold air.

The victims weren't activists or anything ... but they were suffocating so much, they turned blue. It was a man, four kids, and his wife. The oldest boy was 10 years old. Why did this happen? May God curse you, Bashar (al-Assad).\"\n\nAnother man shows coins to the videographer from the Aleppo Media Center, which appear tarnished. The man says he took the coins from the pockets of the dead. \"The gas caused them to change color,\" he says.\n\nThey weren't the only fatalities from the suspected gas attack. A young man says his family was asleep at 1 a.m. when they were awakened by an explosion.\n\n\"We came down and started choking. We discovered it was chlorine gas,\" he said. \"My mother was suffocating and my brother-in-law started foaming at the mouth.\"\n\n'Aleppo is a Holocaust'\n\nSyria's grinding five-year conflict has devastated Aleppo, divided between government-controlled areas in the west and rebel positions in the east.\n\nThe regime, backed by Russian air power, has decimated much of eastern Aleppo with aerial bombardments in recent months, and analysts have said the intensified air raids are a sign the regime may be planning a ground offensive to wrest control of the area.\n\nA government siege on eastern Aleppo since July has essentially cut the area off from the rest of the world -- a stranglehold tactic that the Syrian regime is infamous for.\n\nToday, eastern Aleppo is desperately short of food, medicine and fuel supplies, while the roads are full of rubble from destroyed buildings. The sound of bombings and news of children dying are the norm. \n\n\"Inside the city of Aleppo is a Holocaust,\" an Aleppo resident, who describes himself as an independent media activist, told CNN.\n\nHe said neighbors and families were sharing what little food they had left to survive.\n\nThe United Nations has pushed to get into the area to deliver aid, and on Sunday it announced it had designed a detailed humanitarian plan to provide assistance and medical evacuations from Syria. It said it had shared the plan with all parties in the conflict, as well as its member states.\n\n\"It is imperative all parties agree to the plan and allow us to secure immediate, safe and unimpeded access to provide relief to those most in need in east Aleppo, but equally in all other parts of Syria where there are people in need,\" read a joint statement from Syria Humanitarian Coordinator Ali Al-Za'tari and Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis and Kevin Kennedy.\n\nChildren in the crosshairs\n\nMeanwhile, in regime-held western Aleppo, rebel rocket fire hit a school in the government-held al-Furqan neighborhood, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouallem said at a news conference in Damascus.\n\nHe said 10 students were killed in the attack, while the state-run news agency SANA put the number at eight. \n\n\"What did those kids do to die? I am sad about these students' death,\" he said.\n\nA student at Aleppo University in the west told CNN that security forces had gathered students in the university's main square on Sunday to protest against rebels in eastern Aleppo. \n\nThe student, who CNN is not naming for security reasons, also said they had been told to appeal to the United Nations to have opposition armed groups removed from the east so the siege on civilians can be lifted.\n\nIt is unclear how many children have died in the attacks, but at least eight have been reported killed in eastern Aleppo, and eight in the city's west. Activists said there were likely to be more children among the dead.\n\n'Stop bombing hospitals'\n\nMedical charities have renewed calls on the regime to stop targeting health facilities. \n\n\"For the first time, eastern Aleppo is out of hospitals operating at full capacity,\" said Dr. Mazen Kewara, director of the Syrian American Medical Society's Turkey office.\n\nSeveral major trauma hospitals have been knocked out of service, the organization said, while three floors were destroyed in eastern Aleppo's only dedicated children's hospital, forcing the evacuation of babies, said the charity Doctors Without Borders, which also is known by its French initials MSF.\n\nBut activists working in the city said as many as five other hospitals in eastern neighborhoods were still somewhat functional.\n\nDoctors Without Borders emergency coordinator Teresa Sancristoval said Saturday's bombardment of hospitals marked \"a dark day for east Aleppo.\" \n\n\"The attacks have destroyed entire hospitals, electric generators, emergency rooms and wards, forcing them to stop all medical activities,\" she said.\n\n\"It is not only MSF that condemns indiscriminate attacks on civilians or civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, but also humanitarian law.

And while his business experience was a key part of his appeal to a broad swath of Americans, they will also raise unprecedented questions of conflict of interest and could pose challenges to his ability to sell legislative proposals that could affect his personal bottom line.\n\nBeyond his businessman credo, it seems voters were most drawn to Trump's promises to shake up Washington and implement radical change in every sector of government.\n\nObamacare\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised to \"immediately repeal and replace\" Obamacare, to start. That is something congressional Republicans have been eager to accomplish, but unable to without a Republican president. But even with Trump in office, repealing and crafting a replacement for the law will be an arduous task in Congress, where Senate Democrats will fight the slim Republican majority's efforts.\n\nIt's still unclear exactly what Trump's replacement will look like. He has vowed it will be \"terrific\" and said it will involve knocking down state insurance lines and incentivizing the establishment of health savings accounts.\n\nImmigration\n\nEven as Trump has unrelentingly promised at his rallies to build a wall on the US southern border with Mexico, his plan does not yet appear to have the backing of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who repeatedly dodged a question on whether he supports the wall.\n\n\"I want to achieve border security the way that's most effective,\" he told CNN's Manu Raju Wednesday when asked about it.\n\nThe border wall proposal is just one of a slew of controversial immigration policies proffered by the real estate mogul, who launched his campaign by labeling undocumented Mexican immigrants criminals and \"rapists.\" \n\nHe has also vowed to deport all undocumented immigrants. In the latest iteration of that policy, he focused on the deportation of criminal undocumented immigrants, but he has not forsaken his pledge to deport all estimated 11 million who currently reside here illegally.\n\nTrade\n\nOn trade, the Republican nominee has vowed to renegotiate or completely withdraw the US from NAFTA, the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico that Trump has dubbed the \"worst trade deal in history.\" He could single-handedly do that without Congress, just as he could stymie the Trans-Pacific Partnership he has railed against. \n\nHe has also pledged to go after Chinese currency manipulation and impose additional tariffs of as much as 35% on certain foreign countries and on US companies that move their factories abroad -- which could see consumer goods rise by that same percentage.\n\nTrump's presidency could radically alter the increasingly interconnected global economy, which has shot in the direction of more free trade, not less, in recent years. His presidency could usher in a more protectionist era.\n\nTerrorism\n\nTrump will also seek to rethink how the US combats terrorists, tossing aside the attempts by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama to bring Muslim-Americans and other Muslim countries into the fold, rather than risk alienating them.\n\nTrump has said he would seek to work with Muslim countries eager to join in the fight against ISIS, but he has also stoked Islamophobic sentiment in the US and proclaimed, \"Islam hates us.\"\n\nHis rhetoric on the campaign trail and policy proposals on that matter could prove a roadblock to those efforts of increased cooperation with Muslim majority countries. During his presidential bid, Trump called for the creation of a national database to register all Muslims living in the US, called for targeted surveillance of US mosques.\n\nAnd last December, he famously called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\" a proposal he has never explicitly retracted. Trump has since focused on his \"extreme vetting\" proposal, which would include a ban on individuals from terror-prone countries, though he has not outlined which countries will be included in that list.\n\nIt is still unclear exactly how he will take on ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Trump has at times said he is open to sending in tens of thousands of US troops and consistently vowed to \"bomb the s***t out of ISIS.\" \n\nAt other times, he's said he would like to keep the US out of the civil war in Syria, and instead favored ceding regional influence to Russia.\n\nHe has promised to work toward a closer relationship with Russia, which has ensconced itself as a top US adversary in recent years, and has promised to renegotiate the Iran deal, which he has trashed. \n\nEconomic policy\n\nTrump's economic proposals have focused on tearing down government regulations he views as overly burdensome on US businesses -- which would include undoing environmental protections erected under the Obama administration -- and reforming the US tax code.\n\nBut a cloud of uncertainty hangs over how the whopping across-the-board tax cuts he has promised will affect the US deficit. While he has promised to keep the proposals revenue-neutral, tax policy experts have said Trump's proposals could add billions, if not trillions, of dollars to the US debt.\n\nUltimately, many in Washington and across the country are now wondering how much of Trump's campaign promises will the soon-to-be president stick to once he walks into the Oval Office and the Situation Room.\n\nBeyond the campaign promises and incendiary rhetoric during his 17 months campaigning for his job as president, Trump also repeatedly touted his willingness to compromise and reach \"deals.\"\n\nPressed on his immigration proposals in March on Fox News, Trump offered a simple reply: \"Everything is negotiable.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.0954427719116198, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1078, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.7423823870899997, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 9, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161110040000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.5974025974026, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/health/moldy-hospital-bed-linen-deaths/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 926, "scraper_regex": 986}}, "headline": "Mold at two Pittsburgh hospitals linked to 5 deaths", "wordcount_as_scraped": 986, "date": "20170128080000", "story_content": "Heavy mold growth was found in the linens used at two University of Pittsburgh Medical Center hospitals where five mold-infection-related deaths occurred since October 2014, according to a report.\n\nThe report, which the medical center received in May 2016, was filed January 19, 2017 with the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas in two wrongful-death lawsuits brought against the hospital system by the families of the deceased.\n\nDaniel Krieg, 56, died with a mold-related infection after a kidney transplant a month after the report came out. He was the fifth transplant recipient to succumb to a mold infection in the transplant units at University of Pittsburgh Presbyterian and Montefiore campuses in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. His family and the wife of Che DuVall, 70, who died from infection complications after a lung transplant are suing the hospital for wrongful death of their deceased loved ones. \n\nIn the cases of two other patients who succumbed to the mold outbreak, the medical center settled without litigation for $1.35 million each. A third patient was an unnamed individual in the transplant unit at the Montefiore campus. \n\nThe University of Pittsburgh Medical Center commissioned the report confidentially from hospital environmental specialists Andrew Streifel and Michael Buck in September 2015, after three people died.\n\nDetails of mold report\n\nThe 16-page analysis documents evidence of mold at the hospitals and in nearly every tested area of the Paris Healthcare Linen facility, which handled the hospitals' linen, in Dubois, Pennsylvania.\n\nPittsburgh lawyer Brendan Lupetin filed amended complaints on behalf of Kreig's family and Che DuVall's wife this week, submitting the lab reports and bringing Paris Cos. into the suit as a defendant. Lupetin demanded a jury trial in the new complaints.\n\nParis Cos. said it cannot comment on ongoing litigation, but CEO Dave Stern said in a statement, \"Every day, Paris Companies processes and delivers hygienically safe linens to hospitals and health care institutions across Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Ohio and West Virginia.\"\n\nThe medical center said in a statement that it cannot comment on allegations but will \"continue to work closely with health officials to ensure the safest possible environment for patient care.\"\n\nWhen Streifel and Buck went to the hospitals and tested linen from Paris Cos., a cart of wet sheets delivered to the Montefiore laundry storage area bore \"heavy fungal growth of Mucor and rhizopus,\" according to their report.\n\nAmong the findings at the laundry facility, the report said, was a heavy buildup of lint and mold near the vent through which unfiltered air dried linens that went to University of Pittsburgh Medical Center facilities.\n\nKrieg and DuVall both had rhizopus-positive pneumonia infections that required having multiple lobes of their lungs removed, according to their autopsy reports from the medical center. They both later succumbed to the infections they caught after their transplant operations. \n\nThe hospital system continues to contract its linens from Paris Healthcare Linens, according to spokeswoman Allison Hydzik. As of May, the system furnished 22 of its 25 hospitals with Paris linens, according to the report, but Hydzik would not confirm whether this is still the case.\n\nThese molds are commonplace, and most people aren't susceptible to infections caused by mucor and rhizopus. But they can cause serious problems for immune-suppressed individuals, such as those who have had a transplant or are receiving chemotherapy.\n\n\"In transplant patients with suppressed immune systems these fungal infections are infrequent, but do occur at most major transplant centers without any discernable source,\" the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said in a statement.\n\nStreifel made several recommendations to Paris Cos. in his report and shared his informal findings with company officials during his visit.\n\nHealth care linen services are bound by Healthcare Laundry Accreditation Council standards. The nonprofit accreditation organization requires accredited laundries to maintain facilities like their clean laundry storage areas must be designed to prevent accumulation of dust and lint. Laundries apply for accreditation and must pass inspections to receive and maintain the three-year accreditation, reapplying when it expires. \n\nAs to whether Paris Linen was up to those standards, \"that would not be my opinion,\" Streifel said.\n\n CDC and Department of Health respond\n\nThe hospital system has been in contact with the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the findings, according to Hydzik.\n\nCDC spokesman Tom Skinner confirmed that the agency received a copy of the report in the \"late spring or early summer.\"\n\nStreifel joined conference calls with the hospital, the state department of health and the CDC after presenting his confidential report, he said.\n\n\"We figured (the report) would never come forward,\" he said.\n\n\"The facts of this investigation don't support the conclusion that infections resulted from exposure to linens,\" Pennsylvania Department of Health spokeswoman April Hutcheson said. \"At this time, there is no evidence of an ongoing outbreak. We continue to provide consultative support to UPMC and will investigate as warranted.\"\n\nThe medical center called CDC officials into the two hospitals to investigate the outbreak in September 2015. The Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit was temporary closed, and the 20-bed ICU was evacuated and cleaned.\n\nA week after Streifel submitted his report in May, the CDC published comments about that visit but didn't mention the new report.\n\nIn the CDC review, the fatal infections were not attributed to the mold-covered linens but rather to ventilation that may have allowed dust and mold spores to enter the hospital rooms.\n\nLupetin, the families' attorney, hopes the report will prompt the CDC to return to the hospitals to reopen its investigation, but state officials must invite their federal partners to visit.\n\n\"CDC, state, local and hospital officials completed their investigation and issued a report last year. The agencies stand by this report and there's no evidence of any ongoing outbreak. If state and local officials deem more work is needed and ask CDC for assistance then CDC will assist,\" Skinner said in a statement.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.98804783821106, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 926, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.2193737483200002, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170128080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.0518358531317498, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/20/middleeast/syria-aleppo-evacuation-turkey/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00fc": [741], "\u00c7": [744]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 573, "scraper_regex": 953}}, "headline": "Turkey: Aleppo evacuations could be completed by Wednesday", "wordcount_as_scraped": 953, "date": "20161220160000", "story_content": "The evacuation of the Syrian city of Aleppo could be coming to a close soon, multiple officials and a rebel group said, although they disagreed on the time frame and the number of evacuees.\n\nA group of buses scheduled to evacuate the last civilians and rebels from eastern Aleppo has been delayed, Syrian state-run media said, blaming infighting among rebel factions.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted Tuesday that 37,500 people had been evacuated from the war-torn city so far, adding that \"all evacuations are intended to be finished by tomorrow.\"\n\n37500 people have been evacuated from #Aleppo so far.

But he wanted to bring Spencer to campus because he wanted to spread the message that white people face marginalization.\n\n\"Why would I want to see America become less white?\" Wiginton said. \"Why would I want to be displaced and marginalized?\"\n\nSpencer: I'm not a white supremacist\n\nAhead of the speech, Spencer sat down for a wide-ranging interview with CNN in which he claimed he is not a white supremacist, despite speaking of a Western civilization that, he said, \"only white people can support.\"\n\nHe told reporters the university's reaction to his speaking \"shows the power of the alt-right and the power of our ideas.\"\n\nSpencer addressed a controversial gathering of the alt-right movement last month in Washington when its members gathered to celebrate Donald Trump's victory. Atlantic magazine, which is recording footage of Spencer for a documentary, published a video of the same event showing audience members apparently giving the Nazi salute.\n\n\"Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!\" Spencer declared.\n\nTrump has said repeatedly that he disavows support from the alt-right and white supremacists.\n\nRichard Spencer in Washington \n\nA hate supreme\n\nDuring his speech Tuesday, Spencer told the audience the viral video of his Washington speech happened as the result of \"a desire by the media to slander us with one piece of 30-second footage.\" \n\nThe appearance had no shortage of tense moments. \n\nAt one point, Quentin Boothman, a white freshman, stood up near the front facing Spencer as he silently held a sign with an image of a gun pointed toward Adolf Hitler's face. \n\n\"Follow your leader,\" it read.\n\nAfter Spencer started heckling Boothman, freshman Jalen Brown, who is black, stood in solidarity with his peer. The two locked arms as they stared back at the white nationalist.\n\n\"White supremacy is a dangerous and insanely harmful concept,\" Boothman later told CNN. \"I hate it in all its forms.\" \n\nA man who supported Spencer stood between Spencer and the freshman, staring them down from a close distance. The standoff between Spencer's supporters and the protesters grew to the point where security personnel needed to intervene to defuse the tiff. \n\nAs the speech continued, followed by a tense Q&A, Spencer continued to provoke the crowd as he called for white people to \"have a goddamn identity.\"\n\n\"Race is the foundation of identity,\" he said. \"The word racist is a fake word. No one identifies with the word racist.\"\n\nOfficials: We don't endorse Spencer's rhetoric\n\nBefore the event, Texas A&M Senior Vice President Amy Smith said in a statement that the school \"finds (Spencer's) views as expressed to date in direct conflict with our core values.\" \n\nSmith noted that private citizens like Wiginton can reserve space given the university's public status, but must cover rental expenses to avoid burdening taxpayers.\n\n\"I think these people represent something that is so antithetical to what I believe,\" Texas A&M University President Michael K. Young told CNN. \"I think their ideas are just simply reprehensible and abhorrent.\"\n\nAt the same time, Young noted in a statement, the right of free speech must be acknowledged.\n\nBut to show solidarity, Smith participated in the university's \"Aggies United\" event at Kyle Field whose billing featured actor Hill Harper, journalist Roland Martin and Holocaust survivor Max Glauben, among others. The event took place during Spencer's speech.\n\n'We pledge to move forward'\n\nRegarding the event's backlash, Wiginton told CNN affiliate KBTX that Spencer's appearance is \"reminiscent of civil rights events of the 1960s era, which were often met with whiskey bottles and baseball bats.\" \n\nTo him, the event had to go on, not only to exercise a right of free speech, but to further the cause of white supremacy.\n\n\"We pledge to move forward,\" said Wiginton.\n\nPolice starting to push protestors back #BattLive pic.twitter.com/vYM8nmLrdj\u2014 Aim\u00e9e Rodriguez (@RosalindaAimee) December 7, 2016\n\nBut Spencer's movement -- embraced by mere dozens Tuesday night -- was largely drowned out from the outcry of thousands of protesters who denounced the hatred embedded within his message.\n\nRiot police push protestors out the door, leading to someone being reprimanded #BattLive pic.twitter.com/Eo5qU77t7e\u2014 Aim\u00e9e Rodriguez (@RosalindaAimee) December 7, 2016\n\nImages on social media showed a battalion of police moving protesters from the Memorial Student Center as Spencer spoke in the building.

conciliatory tone towards the 28-member defense alliance at points, saying \"I'm all for NATO,\" during September's debate.\n\nStoltenberg alluded to the President-elect's recent praise of the alliance while speaking to CNN's Christiane Amanpour, saying, \"Donald Trump has clearly stated that he is a big fan of NATO and that has been the case for all American Presidents.\"\n\nBut Stoltenberg's reference to the \"rock-solid\" American commitment to collective defense appeared to push back on comments made by Trump in July, where he seemed to imply that the US should not come to the aid of a NATO member that's attack if the country is not meeting its commitments.\n\nTrump was criticized by members of his own party for the comments.\n\nBut Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally whose could play a role in the Trump administration, went even further.\n\nThe former speaker of the US House cast doubt on whether Washington should defend some of NATO's eastern members, like Estonia, from Russia.\n\n\"I'm not sure I would risk a nuclear war over some place which is the suburbs of St. Petersburg,\" Gingrich told CBS' \"This Morning\" in July.\n\nPerhaps as part of a bid to clear the air, within hours of Trump's victory, Stoltenberg said he looked forward to meeting Trump, welcoming him to Brussels for next year's NATO summit and to discussing \"the way forward.\"\n\nBut what is not clear is what such conversations will look like given Trump's past criticisms of the bloc.\n\nNATO has also made efforts to bolster its presence in Eastern Europe as part of an effort to deter Russia after Russian troops annexed Crimea in 2014.\n\nWhile these deployments, including a battalion of US troops to Poland, have been welcomed by the host nations, they have irked the Kremlin and Trump has made improved relations with Moscow a central theme of his foreign policy approach.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump has praised some of NATO's more recent moves in bolstering its intelligence-sharing efforts, including the establishment of a new post, assistant secretary general for intelligence and security.\n\n\"I think that's great,\" Trump said of the new post, saying that his criticism of the alliance helped drive its creation.\n\nNATO officials have long said the establishment of the new position was not tied to the US presidential campaign.\n\nPerhaps providing insight into Trump's thinking on NATO, Nigel Farage, one of the leaders of the UK drive to leave the EU who has appeared alongside Trump at rallies, told Britain's Express that while Trump was right to call on allies to boost defense expenditures, he backed the US staying in the alliance.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.3468014001846298, "HarmVice":

the man suspected of being responsible for the attack on a Berlin Christmas market, has been arrested in Tunisia, the country's Interior Ministry said Saturday.\n\nHe is one of three men being held in prison on \"suspicion of belonging to a terrorist organization and connections with terrorist offenses,\" according to the ministry.\n\nA statement from the ministry said Amri and his nephew had communicated with each other via the Telegram app, an encrypted messaging service.\n\nAmri asked the nephew to pledge allegiance to ISIS, the ministry said, citing a confession from the nephew. The statement did not name the nephew.\n\nThe ministry also said Amri was in touch with his nephew and sent him money through a third party after asking him to join the \"Abu Al Wala\" cell operating for ISIS in Germany.\n\nAccording to TAP, a Tunisian state-run news agency, the three men are between 18 and 27.\n\nEarlier Saturday, a senior Italian counterterrorism official told CNN's Nina dos Santos \"had all the hallmarks of being on the run alone\" when he was killed in a shootout with two Italian police officers in Milan on Friday.\n\nAmri appeared to have packed hastily and was carrying just over 1,000 euros with him.\n\nREAD: Who was Anis Amri?\n\nAmri, who the official said was \"wearing three pairs of trousers on top of each other,\" had no cellphone, no ID and had just a toothbrush and shaving foam in his backpack.\n\nThe subject of a Europe-wide manhunt since Monday's fatal market attack, Amri was stopped in Sesto San Giovanni, a district in the northeastern part of Milan, just after 3 a.m. local time, Italian police said on Twitter.\n\nA video released on ISIS-affiliated website Amaq shows Amri pledging allegiance to the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and vowing that \"we will slaughter\" the \"crusaders who are shelling the Muslims every day.\"\n\nHe does not refer to Monday's attack that left 12 dead and injured 48, and it's not clear when or where the video was recorded.\n\nItalian investigators are still assessing whether Amri acted alone or had accomplices.\n\nThe encounter that led to Amri's death began when Italian police asked for his papers. When that happened, Amri pulled a .22-caliber gun out of his backpack and fired at them, police said.\n\nThe driver of the police car returned fire, killing the 24-year-old suspect. A police officer, Cristian Morio, was shot in the encounter and is recovering in the hospital. A second officer, Luca Scata, was unharmed.\n\nAmri shouted, \"Bastard cops,\" before he was shot, according to Milan police Chief Antonio De Iesu.\n\nGiuseppe Guida, a taxi driver who arrived on the scene about 10 minutes after the shooting, said police tried to resuscitate the suspect for half an hour before an ambulance carted him away.\n\nAt a news conference, Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti said the slain man was Amri \"without any doubt.\" The Tunisian had previously lived in Italy.\n\nThe officers were not searching for him but stopped Amri as part of normal patrol operations, De Iesu said.\n\nNobody had alerted the police to Amri's presence in the city.\n\nAmri traveled from France, report says\n\nItalian news agency ANSA said Amri came to Milan by train from the French region of Savoy.\n\nA spokeswoman for the French anti-terrorism prosecutor's office, Agnes Thibault Lecuivre, could not confirm the report, telling CNN the investigation was ongoing.\n\nMilan police said Amri arrived at the city's central station about 1 a.m. Friday.\n\nIf he did travel from France, Amri would have passed through at least two European borders after fleeing Berlin.\n\nIn response, Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Front Party, criticized the European Union's open borders policy as a \"security disaster.\"\n\nGerman officials are working to determine whether Amri had a network of people helping him flee to Italy, German federal prosecutor Peter Frank said.\n\n Amri was on threat list\n\nAmri was considered to be one of the most dangerous Islamists in the country for months before Monday's attack, according to German intelligence officials.\n\nIn March, he was put on a German security services list of dangerous people, which currently includes 549 individuals, the officials said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a press conference that government ministers will be assessing what security measures need to be adapted in the wake of this week's attack.\n\nMerkel said she had spoken to Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi about speeding up the process of returning Tunisians living in Germany illegally.\n\nREAD: Two countries tried to deport Amri\n\nLinks to Italy\n\nWithout identification, Amri entered Italy in February 2011 and claimed to be a 17-year-old minor, a spokesman for the Italian state police, Mario Viola, told CNN earlier this week.\n\nWhile in Italy, he served four years in prison after being involved in an arson attack on a school, his father told Tunisian radio.\n\nViola said that Amri's jail term for damaging state property, assault and arson at the Lampedusa refugee center began in late 2011. He was released in May 2015.\n\nItalian authorities ordered his deportation, but Tunisian authorities wouldn't accept the request on the grounds of a lack of proper documentation, Viola said.\n\nAt that point, Italian authorities told Amri to leave the country, and officials lost track of him.\n\nAmri was \"not suspected\" of terrorism at the time and was considered a \"petty criminal,\" Viola said. The Tunisian came to Italy at the same time as thousands of others amid the turmoil of the Arab Spring, he said.\n\nHe left for Germany more than a year ago.\n\nHow the manhunt unfolded\n\nAmri's fingerprints were found in the cabin of the truck used in Monday's attack, and German authorities are investigating whether the gun Amri used Friday was the same one in the shooting death of the truck's Polish driver.\n\nThe slain driver may have been involved in a struggle with Amri before being shot.\n\nGerman authorities initially detained a Pakistani asylum seeker in connection with the Christmas market attack, but he was later released and a search began for Amri.\n\nEuropean authorities offered a reward of up to 100,000 euros (about $104,000) for information on his whereabouts.\n\nAccording to German investigative files obtained by CNN, Amri had ties to an ISIS recruitment network in Germany and had previously discussed launching an attack there.\n\nAmri's mother: 'I want the truth\n\nAmri's mother, Nour Elhouda Hassani, said her son called last Friday to catch up and that nothing had struck her as odd.\n\n\"All we talked about was how are you and how is everything. I did not notice anything strange about him,\" she said, speaking to CNN exclusively from her family's home in the small Tunisian town of Oueslatia. \"When he calls me, he was playful and always laughing. He was not an extremist, he was like all young men around here. He always went out and drank alcohol.\"\n\nShe demanded answers about his death.\n\n\"I want the truth about what happened to my son,\" she said. \"I want the Tunisian and German government to tell me what happened to my son. We want the truth. Why did they kill him? He was a suspect; they could have gotten more information from him, had they captured him alive. Was he a terrorist?

On paper, the concept is clear -- asexual people simply don't experience sexual attraction -- but since scientists are so early on in their attempts to understand the phenomenon, they're not quite sure about many of the specifics. \n\nThere are a bunch of interesting, obvious questions touching on facets of sexuality that don't entail getting together with another person: To take two, how often do asexual people masturbate? Do they have sexual fantasies?\n\nTo better understand this group, a trio of University of British Columbia researchers, Morag Yule, Lori Brotto, and Boris Gorzalka, conducted a survey in which they asked 739 people, 351 of them asexual (as defined by an inventory of questions designed to capture asexuality), about their sexual experiences and fantasies. \n\nThe results, just published in Archives of Sexual Behavior, strongly suggest that the \"asexual\" label could be capturing too broad a group, and that it might be time to get a bit more fine-grained.\n\nWhy straight men have sex with each other\n\nHere's the key bit from the paper's conclusion:\n\n\"While there are a number of differences between asexual and sexual groups in terms of patterns of masturbation and sexual fantasy, as well as in contents of sexual fantasy, the similarity between the groups on several of these measures is striking. For example, nearly half of asexual women and three quarters of asexual men reported both experiencing sexual fantasy and masturbating, despite reporting a lack of sexual attraction to other people and identifying as asexual. \n\nFurther, there was significant overlap in the sexual fantasies experienced by participants, regardless of their asexual or sexual status. Sexual fantasies have long been thought to reveal an individual's innermost desires. However, the current data suggest that if this is true, individuals do not necessarily act on these desires. An asexual individual may not experience sexual attraction, but may nonetheless engage in sexual fantasy, perhaps to facilitate physiological sexual arousal and masturbation. The sexual fantasies may not be reflections of innate sexual wants or desires.\n\n\"More research will be needed to ascertain whether this is because the individual cannot act on these desires (in the case of being attracted to fictional characters), because social constraints prohibit them from doing so, or because there is a disconnect between their subjective sense of self in relation to sexual targets. \n\nFurther, these findings suggest that sexual fantasies are not, in fact, ubiquitous, as previous writings have suggested. What makes one individual have sexual fantasies, and whether they appear spontaneously or deliberately, versus another individual not having fantasies, is a fascinating area of inquiry that may also inform the debate on whether lack of sexual fantasies should be a marker of a sexual desire disorder.\"\n\nThe key takeaway, again, is that when it came to fantasies and masturbation, there was simply less of a difference between the sexual and asexual groups than one might expect.\n\nWhy some couples have more sex\n\nAnother really interesting aspect of the paper dealt specifically with asexual people's fantasies, which were elicited by open-ended questions on the survey. Oftentimes, they fantasized in a third-person sort of way, with both asexual men and women far more likely than their sexual counterparts to fantasize about situations not involving them.\n\nA few examples from asexual respondents:\n\n\"I do have sexual fantasies but most of the time they do not involve me or any real person. I sexually fantasize about fictional male couples and their romantic and sexual relationships and events. They are all monogamous relationships where they are faithful to one another (no affairs). With fictional male couples, my sexual fantasies can involve many and varying sexual preferences and fetishes. [...]\" (female, 19 years old)\n\n\"I don't put myself into my fantasies. That is thoroughly unappealing to me. Instead, I imagine other people in sexual situations, and focus on their thoughts and feelings for a sort of vicarious arousal. I don't want to do anything sexual with any of the people I imagine, and by themselves, they don't turn me on. I think it's because I'm not capable of feeling sexual attraction or lust, so I mentally conjure up people who are and empathize with them (though my ideas of how they experience lust are, since I'm asexual, awfully vague in some ways and probably way off base in others)\" (female, 32 years old)\n\n\"I enjoy watching other people enjoy their sexuality. I like the role of being strictly a voyeur but I love being the cause of them enjoying their sexuality. Although I am very excited by these situations I wouldn't call it sexual excitement. Although my body is clearly aroused by it, I have no desire to attend to that arousal. I very much enjoy being the one who does not physically engage in sexual behavior while being the one who provokes it in others. I like to see my romantic partner endure unpleasant situations that I've created because I feel that his willingness to sacrifice his comfort is an expression of his devotion to me. I like to see a partner insensible with excitement or pleasure because of my interaction with them. This makes me feel very emotionally enticed and engaged but sexually I feel disengaged and disinterested even though my body is aroused\" (female, 35 years old)\n\nAltruistic people have more sex\n\nNow, there was still a healthy proportion of asexual people who reported having never had a sexual fantasy -- about 20 percent for men and 35 percent for women, with the equivalent percentages for sexual men and women close to zero. But it's still interesting that so many people who qualify as asexual the way we currently define the term have fantasies about sex. It suggests there's a lot more unpacking and research to be done before researchers fully understand asexuality.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.04931795597076, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 865, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.70560573084, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 11, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.27167630057803, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/01/us/demand-tracker-phone-numbers/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 626, "scraper_regex": 674}}, "headline": "Website tracks calls to fake ads offering youngsters for sex", "wordcount_as_scraped": 674, "date": "20161201140000", "story_content": "Renee Shelby doesn't have your average job.

And the models -- all adults -- agreed to pose for them.\n\nIt's part of the organization's new initiative called Demand Tracker. YouthSpark provides support to juvenile victims of sex trafficking and those at risk of exploitation.

Just two hours later, it had garnered more than 30 responses.  Total number of unique phone numbers collected in the site's four-month history? 12,000.\n\n\"Roughly 40% of those are guys calling in from out of town who are flying in,\" Trouteaud says. \n\n\"They'll give us their flight information, they'll tell us where to meet them, how much they're wanting to spend to buy a young person for sex -- hundreds of dollars. So this is a problem of scale.\" \n\nRead: Sex-trafficking victims branded like slaves\n\nYouthSpark leaves the follow-up to law enforcement. \n\nLimitations\n\nHaving these phone numbers may seem like a slam-dunk for police. But, it's more complicated than that. \n\nThe database only confirms that a particular phone was used to call or send a message to a decoy ad. It cannot provide confirmation of who made the call or if the owner of the phone has ever completed an illegal transaction. It also can't differentiate between intentional calls and misdials.\n\nAnyone whose number appears on the site has the option to click the \"remove number from list\" button which will remove the number from the public-facing list; however, it will remain in the database itself.\n\nTrouteaud says law enforcement is mainly concerned with repeat callers as those calls are more likely to be intentional calls to buy juveniles for sex. \n\nWhat happens with the data?\n\nDemand Tracker is still new, as is access to the type of data it provides. Law enforcement hasn't quite figured out the best uses for the information yet, but they do see it as a value-add.\n\n\"It could help in bringing together training curriculum on how to track purchasers by looking at their patterns and habits,\" says DeKalb County assistant district attorney Dalia Racine. \"It could also help with pushing legislation to make tougher laws against purchasers.\"\n\nYouthSpark's long-term plan is to expand its partnerships with law enforcement entities -- the data could ultimately help those entities allocate their limited resources more effectively and remove more sex predators from the streets -- and from the internet. \n\nThey're also partnering with local companies. Companies can check company-owned phone numbers against the database to identify potential predators in their ranks.\n\nRacine says the initiative sends a clear message to predators. \n\n\"We are coming after the demand side just as hard as we are after the exploiters and the supply side of this issue.

Not because of what he would see once he got there, but for how he -- and the people he was about to meet -- would react.\n\nBut then he saw Rupa. \n\n\"When I saw Rupa for the first time, every feeling was gone immediately,\" he said. \"Because I saw in her face and in the face of the other girls -- in Ritu and Dolly -- I saw a very big smile.\"\n\nRupa, Ritu and Dolly are some of the women who work at the Sheroes Hangout Cafe. The three of them, and the others who work there, are all survivors of acid attacks. \n\nBorella says it was less than 10 minutes after meeting the women that he found himself sitting with them in front of the cafe singing \"O sole mio\" in Italian.\n\nThe cafe opened in December 2014 and was founded by Stop Acid Attacks, a New Delhi-based nonprofit. Sheroes aims to create awareness about acid attacks and to foster confidence in acid attack survivors. Borella has made several trips to the cafe for his photo series, \"Sheroes, After the Acid Attacks.\" \n\nOne of the first pictures he made -- post-singing session -- is of Ritu sitting inside Sheroes. He captured the moment from behind a glass.\n\n\"It was a sort of way to start my work with caution,\" Borella said of the photo, No. 14 in the gallery above. \"In this picture, I can see Ritu thinking. She's not aware of my presence.\"\n\nSince the Italian photographer doesn't speak Hindi and the women don't speak English, they rely on someone to translate for them. But this language barrier doesn't seem to matter, Borella says, because with simple gestures and behaviors, they've managed to develop strong connections and relationships.\n\nBorella hopes his photographs raise awareness about acid attacks in India, and he wants to show survivors from a more positive perspective. One of his favorite pictures is of Rupa dancing with tourists.\n\n\"This picture for me represents what is the real mission of the Sheroes Hangout,\" he said of the fifth photo above. \"It was funny because (the tourists) asked for music. They immediately started dancing in less than five minutes. There was a sort of strong feeling between them -- the tourists -- and the rest of the girls on the left -- Dolly, Ritu and Gita.\"\n\nBorella says he gets goose bumps every time he thinks about what the women at Sheroes have been through. The reasons and motivations behind acid attacks are especially troubling to him, and they primarily target women. According to the Acid Survivors Foundation in India, acid attacks result from a number of situations: family disputes, vengefulness, jealousy, mistaken identity and sex crimes, among others. \n\nGita, for instance, was attacked by her husband out of jealousy, she said. He threw acid at her as well as at her two daughters -- Nitu, who was maimed and blinded, and Krishna, who was killed. And then there's Ritu, who was only 17 when she was attacked in the middle of the street by two men on a motorcycle. \n\n\"Every time, I think about the pure evil, in which way the human race can be very bad,\" Borella said. \"Almost every day, I'm trying to understand: Why the acid? Why? Why?\"\n\nIt's not only men who attack women. Rupa's mother died when she was a child. When Rupa was 17, her stepmother thought she looked too much like her mother, so she threw acid on her face while she was sleeping.\n\nAcid attacks happen around the globe, and Borella says that in India, chemicals are pretty cheap to get. Last year, there were 249 reported acid attacks in India, according to the country's Acid Survivors Foundation. In 2013, the country's laws were reformed so that attacking someone with chemicals became punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\nBorella wonders whether people in the region have become used to acid attacks. He describes how, as an Italian, people always stare at him when he's in India -- yet they never seem to pay much attention when they see someone severely disfigured by an acid attack.\n\n\"When I saw that they are probably used to seeing victims of acid attacks ... I said: 'Oh my God, no. This cannot be possible,' \" Borella said. \"It's hard to believe that you are used to seeing tragedy like this.\"\n\nWhat Borella finds interesting is that Sheroes is not too far from the Taj Mahal. In fact, you can see the marble mausoleum in the top left corner of photo No. 2 in the gallery above, while Sheroes is delicately lit toward the bottom center. \n\nThe Taj Mahal -- commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal -- is one of the reasons Agra is known as the city of love, Borella says.\n\n\"In the same area, there is almost the opposite,\" he said, referring to how acid attacks -- acts certainly not born out of love -- are the reason Sheroes came to be in the first place. \"It's something like black and white, night and day.\"\n\nDespite this, there seems to be a lot of love at Sheroes -- from the people who created it to the women who work there to the customers who visit it. The cafe has become a place where survivors can be comfortable, a place where they can remove the veils they may have once felt the need to cover themselves with.\n\nAfter an attack, Borella says, many of the women would be afraid to show their faces in public, for fear of people staring at their scars and the discrimination they would face. \n\n\"I understood that with the help of the Sheroes Hangout NGO, they are not afraid anymore,\" Borella said. \"They are confident. They are not scared in front of the foreigners, in front of the customers, in front of the local people.\"\n\n He recalls one moment in particular that he had with Dolly. At 12 years old, Dolly was attacked while trying to defend her sister from a neighbor's unwanted advances. Borella says he asked her for a picture of her before the attack, which can be seen on the right in photo No. 12.\n\n \"When Dolly (gave) me her picture, I was crying,\" Borella said. \"My reaction was immediately very strong, very, very strong. She noticed it, and she said: 'Federico, don't worry. I am happy right now.' \"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.586330890655519, "HarmVice": 22, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1024, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.13619528389, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161116020000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.9296875, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/us/lagrange-georgia-callaway-1940-lynching/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 829, "scraper_regex": 1422}}, "headline": "'Justice failed Austin Callaway': Town attempts to atone for 1940 lynching ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1422, "date": "20170126220000", "story_content": "When it happened, news of Austin Callaway's lynching on September 8, 1940, was buried on the last page of his hometown newspaper in LaGrange, Georgia.\n\n\"Negro succumbs to shot wounds,\" read the LaGrange Daily News headline, squeezed between the personal ads and a report on a church fish fry. \"Dies Sunday at Hospital, Struck by Seven Bullets.\" \n\nLaGrange police did not investigate the killing of the young man, reported at the time to be 16 years old. The courts did not act and the media did not follow the story after day one. In a scenario that sounds all too familiar, then and now, no one was held accountable. \n\nIt would take 76 years for city officials to admit what really happened. \n\n\"We failed Austin Callaway,\" Mayor Jim Thornton said. \"Justice failed Austin Callaway.\"\n\n'The truth shall set you free'\n\nThe words echoed through LaGrange's Warren Temple United Methodist Church Thursday night, where more than 200 people crammed into pews and folding chairs to remember Callaway. \n\nUniformed police officers flanked the congregation of black and white people sitting side by side. Programs ran out as attendance exceeded expectations, forcing people into an overflow room in a building next door.\n\nIt was a rare public reconciliation for a lynching in the South, part of renewed efforts to acknowledge the mob violence white Southerners inflicted on their African-Americans neighbors for much of the 20th century. The Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, Alabama, has documented 4,075 racial terror lynchings in Southern states between 1877 and 1950, few of which have been publicly acknowledged.\n\n\"Some would like to see us bury the past and move on,\" Thornton said. \"Until we have a full and complete acknowledgment of the past we can never heal.\"\n\nCNN found four instances of apologies for lynchings, only one of them in the Southeast. In 2005, a group of white ministers in Abbeville, South Carolina apologized for crimes against African-Americans, including the 1916 lynching of a black farmer. \n\nComing in a moment of heightened racial tensions and distrust of law enforcement, the president of the Troup County NAACP said he hopes LaGrange can be a model of mutual respect and reconciliation.\n\n\"When you stop to think about it, the fact that in this day and time the chief of police and the president of the local branch of the NAACP can come together and do what we feel is right for the community as a whole and neither one of us compromised, that's a powerful thing,\" Ernest Ward said.\n\nAs one elected official after another took the pulpit, delivering moving apologies to the African-American community and pledges to do better, the tone evolved from somber to reverent to hopeful. \n\nAs Troup County State Court Judge Jeannette Little proclaimed to applause and cheers, \"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.\"\n\n'The past shapes the present'\n\nCallaway's lynching lived in whispers among African-Americans of that era. As they passed on, in the absence of official records, media accounts, a gravestone, Callaway faded from the town's collective memory. \n\nAlmost no one in LaGrange today knew Austin Callaway's name until recently -- not his descendants, not the local NAACP president, not the mayor, not even Police Chief Louis Dekmar, who is white.\n\nAs the chief learned more about the lynching, he came to understand how it had strained relations between his force and the African-American community. He decided it was time to apologize for law enforcement's role and acknowledge its impact on community relations.\n\nThe apology is about more than righting the wrongs of the past, he said. In an era of fractured relations between law enforcement and the communities it serves, it's about building trust.\n\n\"The past shapes the present,\" he said in an interview before the event.  \n\n\"This in an effort to evolve our relationship and partnership with the African-American community and allow us a city as a whole to move forward. That can only be done if trust is established. That trust can only occur if past wrongs are acknowledged and addressed.\"\n\nThe facts as we know them\n\nDekmar's quest began with a conversation between two African-American women visiting police headquarters, he told the crowd. As they looked at historic photos hanging on the walls someone overheard one of them whisper \"they killed our people\" and shared the comment with Dekmar.\n\nThrough conversations with African-American elders he learned the facts of the lynching -- little of which have changed since 1940.\n\nWhile a fire tore through the fertilizer plant across town, six armed men wearing hoods stormed the jail where Callaway was being held. News reports from the time said Callaway was arrested on a change of assaulting a white woman, Dekmar said. But no official record remains today describing the allegations.\n\nThe mob ordered the lone jailer at gunpoint to open Callaway's cell and fled into the night with him. Hours later, a passerby found him on a dirt road in a rural part of the county. He had been shot five times, with wounds in the head, hands and arms. Dekmar said. He was brought to the hospital and later died.\n\nThe community's indifference was spelled out in the findings of the grand jury, to \"get better locks for the jail,\" he said.\n\nLaw enforcement failed to protect Austin Callaway, \"and for that I am profoundly sorry. It shouldn't have happened,\" he said, eliciting cheers from the crowd. \n\n\"I sincerely regret the role law enforcement played in Austin Calloway's death, both through our action and our inaction.\"\n\nAn apology might ring hollow to the African-American community as an effort gloss over the past, he said. To the white community it may seem like ancient history that no one today is responsible for, he said.\n\nThose involved may be gone, but the police force that neglected its duty to Callaway is still here, he said. \"It bears the burden of that history.\"\n\n'An era of hatred'\n\nLaw enforcement doesn't carry all the blame, LaGrange College President Dan McAlexander said. There is no evidence that LaGrange College or any of the town's civic organizations sought justice, he said. Their inaction led one person, Warren Temple Pastor L.W. Strickland to send a letter to the NAACP calling for an investigation.\n\nThe investigation went nowhere but it led the NAACP to expand its definition of lynching beyond the public spectacles traditionally associated with the mob violence. Callaway's death showed that lynchings could happen \"underground,\" beyond public view, and still terrorize the African-African community into silence.\n\nDeborah Tatum, whose grandfather was the brother of Callaway's father, learned his name and his story in 2014 while researching genealogy. She was surprised to learn about the terrible secret but could understand why her relatives may have kept it hidden.\n\n\"They tried to protect us as much as they could from the bad things happening,\" said Tatum, 55, a lifelong resident of LaGrange. \"I don't think they had the luxury of being able to go to the police and or the officials for help. It was such an era of hatred.\"\n\nTatum's uncle, James Callaway, has a harder time understanding how the killing remained a secret so long -- or why it happened in the first place.\n\n\"Why would they be that down-low and dirty to do something like that to a kid?\" he said. \"It was like a black mark on the family.\"\n\nMoving forward\n\nTatum and Dekmar were not the only ones searching for the truth about Callaway. \n\nA church book discussion about lynchings piqued Wesley Edwards' curiosity in area hate crimes, leading to Austin Callaway. A longtime African-American friend, Bobbie Hart, confessed ignorance to the lynching, prompting them to form the group \"Troup Together.\" Through archival research and interviews, the pieced together parts of Calloway's story.\n\nThe \"knowledge deficit\" is what worries Edwards. If Callaway's lynching remained a mystery all these years, what else don't they know about? \n\n\"If white people have one version of history and African-Americans have a different one, then we don't know what we don't know,\" he said. \"We've got to bridge that gap.\"\n\nThursday's event marks the start of the healing process, Hart said. What's next? The need to save troubled African-American men in today's communities, she said.\n\nTopics such as poverty, incarceration and equal access to education bubbled up at various points in the ceremony, with less fanfare. It's easier, perhaps, to build consensus around reconciliation and healing than it is for systemic issues.\n\n\"I believe the will is there,\" she said, \"We need to keep working together.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.3003299236297594, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 829, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.57909448819, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.86007237635706, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/travel/gettysburg-national-military-park-living-historians/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [350, 3572]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 728, "scraper_regex": 770}}, "headline": "Fighting Gettysburg again, remembering those who perished", "wordcount_as_scraped": 770, "date": "20161118230000", "story_content": "Peter \"Reynolds\" Bedrossian marches steadily through a misty green pasture. The relentless summer sun beats down on his thick wool uniform as beads of sweat gather under his cap. \n\nSlowly, he walks through the Pennsylvania farmland, musket at the ready to face the attacking Confederate army. \u00a0\n\nWhile Bedrossian appears ready to fight in the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg, he's actually one of many reenactors at Gettysburg National Military Park who spend many of their weekends dressing, talking, eating and sleeping like Civil War soldiers. \n\n\"When you go and the gunfire takes place,\" says Bedrossian, a longtime reenactor, \"there's a visceral response to that.\"\n\nCNN: National Park Service turns 100\n\n\"The smoke smells, you see the smoke, you feel that gun blast going off,\" he tells CNN. \"They may get the aroma of our coffee beans, or the bacon... or they feel the weight of a Minie ball, or 10 rounds of ammunition.\" \n\nIt's all part of the park's commitment -- and the hard work of park officials and volunteers -- to bring the incredible historical events that occurred on this land back to life. \n\nOn November 19, Gettysburg National Military Park and the Lincoln Fellowship of Pennsylvania mark a historic day that the Battle of Gettysburg made possible. \n\nTo mark the 153rd anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln's historic Gettysburg Address, there will be a wreath-laying ceremony at the Soldiers' National Monument, followed by the Dedication Day program with actor LeVar Burton speaking and Lincoln portrayer George Buss reciting the Gettysburg Address. \n\nAnd come springtime, the living historians who re-create the lives of those who fought at Gettysburg will be back. \n\n\"Here at Gettysburg, they've even gone above and beyond the 'living historians.' They're educators,\" says park ranger Thomas Holbrook.   \n\nThese volunteers are actually everyday firefighters, veterans, retirees, teachers and Civil War enthusiasts. \n\nWhile the majority of soldiers are gray-haired, their ranks do include the occasional millennial or high school history nerd, happy to endure the discomforts of an authentically 19th-century life to teach visitors about the famous battle that changed the course of American history. \n\nGettysburg was once a sleepy farm town, full of fields and pastures. All that changed after Confederate forces attacked a federal post at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, in 1861, launching the Civil War. \n\nBattle of Gettyburg's 150th anniversary\n\nIn the summer of 1863, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee tried for a second time to invade the North. \n\nFor three days, the two armies clashed in and around the small town of Gettysburg. More than 165,000 soldiers fought. By the end of the third day, the tide turned against Lee's troops, and he retreated through Maryland to Virginia. \n\nThe war's bloodiest battle, with 51,000 casualties (dead, wounded, captured or missing), is considered a turning point in the war to Union victory.  (Historians put the number soldiers killed outright at more than 10,000, said park spokeswoman Katie Lawhon.)\n\nJust four months later, Lincoln came to Gettysburg to dedicate the cemetery and deliver his now immortal words in the Gettysburg Address. \n\n\"These dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth,\" Lincoln said. \n\nSome 1.2 million visitors came to Gettysburg in 2015 to explore the 6,000-acre site, which\u00a0includes 1,320 monuments and memorials, 148 historic buildings, 410 cannons and the Soldiers' National Cemetery. (About 3,500 of the 7,756 total interments are Civil War burials. The rest came from subsequent wars.)  \n\n\"Gettysburg is important. It's important that we at least -- at the very least -- experience Gettysburg for the vast sacrifice that these men made,\" says Holbrook. \n\nEvery weekend from April through October 30, guests can experience the living history program brought alive by Bedrossian and his comrades representing soldiers and civilians.\n\nVisitors can explore the soldiers' camps, see weapons demonstrations, smell the bacon and meet the volunteers up close. \n\nThe participants forsake the luxuries of modern life, playing baseball with equipment from the time or playing music such as  \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" on large military drums and high-pitched flutes.      \n\n\"We sit around the campfire, we may smoke pipes and drink something, sing period music, and the 21st century goes away,\" Bedrossian says. \n\nThese volunteers say they are dedicated to sharing their passion with the public.  \n\nSummer in the park at Gettysburg\n\n\"We are a product of our past,\" Bedrossian says. \n\n\"History may have happened long ago, that's very true. But it didn't happen far away.

He said he feared for his life when 15-year-old James Means allegedly pulled a gun on him. The complaint did not say Means had a gun. \n\n\"I mean, believe me, I did not want to kill anybody, but they're not going to kill me,\" Pulliam, wearing an orange jailhouse uniform, told the station on Tuesday. \n\nPulliam has been charged with first-degree murder in an incident police and witnesses say started with two strangers bumping into each other Monday night. He has not yet been assigned an attorney by the public defender's office. \n\nThe suspect told police he had dinner immediately after the alleged crime and then visited a female friend -- in whose home the .380 revolver used in the shooting was found, according to the criminal complaint filed in Kanawha County magistrate court.\n\n'I felt my life was in danger'\n\nIn the jailhouse interview, Pulliam said shooting was his only option.\n\n\"I felt my life was in danger,\" he told the station. \"I'm sorry, but I'm 62 years old. I'm not going to take a bunch of punks beating me up.\" \n\nFriends of the victim told police that Pulliam and Means bumped each other outside a Dollar General store on Washington Street East in Charleston, according to the complaint.\n\nWords were exchanged but Pulliam entered the store.\n\nWhen Pulliam came back outside, one of Means' friends said, the teen and the older man again had a \"verbal dispute,\" the complaint said.\n\nMeans crossed the street to confront Pulliam, who fired two shots at the teenager, according to the friend.\n\nPulliam told WCHS that he saw three teens outside a house as he was walking to the store. They were laughing, he said. One of them cursed him when he got closer. \n\n\"What the ... did you say to me?\" Pulliam recalled asking the teenager. \n\nThe teen flashed a gun, Pulliam told the station. The friends encouraged Means to shoot but Pulliam continued into the store.\n\nPulliam said in the interview that he walked on the other side of the street when he left the store to avoid trouble but that Means approached him and taunted him with a gun. \n\n\"I just shot him,\" Pulliam told the station.\n\nHe added, \"I work. I'm a good citizen. I don't do anything to anybody.\"\n\nPulliam said race did not factor into the confrontation. He is white, Means was black. \n\n\"I don't care if they're white or black,\" he told WCHS. \n\n\"Nobody is going to do me like that. It doesn't make any difference if he's black. My God, everybody I live around over there is black. I get along with all of them. Ask them.\"\n\nIn an email statement, the FBI said it was monitoring the case. \n\n\"If in the course of the local investigation, information comes to light of a potential federal civil rights violation, the FBI is prepared to investigate,\" the statement said. \n\nPulliam may not have had right to own gun\n\nIt appears that Pulliam should not have been armed. He pleaded no contest to domestic violence charges in 2013, according to WCHS. Federal law prohibits anyone convicted of domestic violence charges from possessing a gun. \n\nMeans' relatives, meanwhile, remembered the teenager as smart, funny and loving. \n\n\"James could put a smile on anybody's face no matter the situation,\" his aunt, Teresa Means, told the station.\n\nThe teen's mother, Nafia Adkins, said: \"My son's in a safer place now, and we all love him.\" \n\nObi Henderson, who knew Means from a nonprofit he founded to help young people, described the teenager as \"mild-mannered.\" \n\n \"James means was not a gang member,\" Henderson told CNN Saturday. \"He was not walking around in the streets trying to promote violence and wreak havoc on people. That wasn't the type of person that he was. He was an honest, humble, very respectful young man.\"   \n\nOn Friday night, friends and relatives held a candlelight vigil for Means. And a dinner was held at Grace Bible Church.\n\n\"It was more an opportunity for us to come together, meaning family, friends ... and a time to reflect on the positive person that James Means was and give an opportunity for friends and family to laugh and embrace the joy of who he was,\" Henderson recalled. \n\nThe family, which has set up a GoFundMe page for funeral expenses, made a plea to Means' friends: Let justice take its course. Don't seek revenge. Don't post messages of hate on social media. \n\n\"I'm going to leave everything up to the courts to take care of this man and do whatever they have to do to make him be punished,\" Adkins told the WCHS. \n\n\"We don't hold a grudge, so nobody else should hold a grudge.

The cited factors range from the brutality of the Negan arc to the show's disjointed format to viewers simply tiring of being manipulated by the producers with gimmicky twists.\n\nAs the show preps for its midseason finale on Sunday, there's another, more nebulous aspect worth considering: whether TV's glut of dystopian dramas and alternate futures amounts to overplaying a winning hand, perhaps especially amid a time of heightened real-life apprehensions.\n\nPeople watch television for a host of reasons, and escapism is only one of them. Indeed, one of the strongest attributes of the current TV era has been more provocative shows with the latitude to tell stories that don't necessarily have to attract mass audiences or fret about alienating sponsors.\n\nStill, the sheer weight and at times crushing darkness of these shows is one factor to consider, after a protracted political campaign filled with talk of Russian-backed hacking and rising levels of extremism, or at least more open displays by such fringe groups.\n\nGranted, there's an abundance of virtually everything on television now -- a byproduct of what has come to be called \"peak TV,\" with more original shows than ever. Moreover, part of that is due specifically to \"Walking Dead,\" which by garnering huge ratings on once little-seen AMC helped embolden other networks and streaming services to try emulating that model.\n\nNevertheless, the dreary worldview embodied by \"Walking Dead\" -- which has only become nastier through the years, with humans (and now the dictatorial Negan) supplanting zombies as the true monsters -- has grown especially prevalent. As a consequence, the AMC show's huge cultural cachet is being pecked at by newer series that its popularity, ironically, helped birth.\n\nThis week, for example, saw both the season finale of HBO's \"Westworld,\" a revival built around a world where near-sentient robots are more humane than actual people; and the second-season debut of \"The Man in the High Castle,\" an Amazon series that explores an alternate reality in which the Nazis and Japanese won World War II.\n\nSyfy's new drama \"Incorporated\" is set in 2074, where the globe has experienced a corporate takeover, with governments falling due to the ravages of climate change. AMC's \"Humans,\" due back in February, mines terrain similar to \"Westworld,\" as synthetic helpers begin to turn against their human owners.\n\nNetflix also recently premiered new episodes of \"Black Mirror,\" a British anthology series that conjures a variety of technology-based nightmares, with stories set about 10 minutes in the future.\n\nThere's a demonstrable audience for such fare, particularly within smaller niches. But the gradual tune-out for \"Walking Dead\" -- whose most recent episode drew an estimated 10.4 million viewers with its initial airing, versus 17 million for the seventh-season premiere in October -- indicates some people are abandoning the show, even if those numbers still dwarf most of what's on TV.\n\nThe \"why\" of that can't be traced to any one factor, including something as vague as the national mood. With ratings that high, obvious explanations -- like age and the TV version of simple gravity -- shouldn't be dismissed.\n\nThat said, one suspects at least some of those wayward viewers have concluded, consciously or not, that real life is scary enough.\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on AMC.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.335628032684331, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 531, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.14991914915, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 7, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.31826741996234, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.636363636364}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/opinions/big-questions-for-election-day-zelizer/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "A shocked and scandalized nation waits for answers", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1520, "date": "20161106170000", "story_content": "It's almost over. The campaign that has consumed America's attention for so many months finally reaches a conclusion. It seems that we have seen everything under the sun. \n\nThe nation has been shocked, it has been scandalized, it has been totally absorbed in this historic confrontation between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nThe obvious and most consequential questions that will be answered are who will inhabit the White House and which party will control Congress.  \n\nBut it is also possible to step back and pinpoint three other questions that have loomed large during the final months of the campaign. The results that come in on election night should begin to answer these.\n\nIs the Republican Party facing a civil war?\n\nThis is the question that Trump's campaign has raised ever since he defeated a long list of \"establishment\" candidates in the primaries. His rise to power has generated commentary that the Republican Party is split in half. There is a major battle unfolding between the Trump Republicans and the rest of the party that has dominated the GOP for many years. \n\nAccording to this narrative, the party will face a moment of reckoning when this election is over, particularly if Trump loses and the GOP enters into a moment of soul searching. \n\nYet not everyone agrees. Some argue that the party remains in pretty good shape. Partisan polarization will probably lead most Republicans to remain loyal to their party regardless of who is at the top of their ticket. Trump also represents powerful forces that have been reshaping the party for almost a decade. He might be an outlandish version of these new party forces, but he is a product rather than a generator of this political style and these political ideas. \n\nObviously, if Trump were to win the election the warnings of a party civil war would be considered overblown. Everyone loves to be victorious, and a defeat of Hillary Clinton would signal that the party under Trump is in pretty good shape. But even if he loses, many may conclude the \"death of the GOP\" has been an exaggeration.\n\nIt is very likely that Trump can pull about the same level of the electorate as Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. That has been the big story of the last week: that many Republicans are deciding to come home to back Trump. It is also quite possible that Trump might lose but that Republicans will maintain control of the Senate and the House as well as a large number of state legislatures. If this is the case, it will signal that the party can handle the tensions and divisions that have emerged. \n\nIf Trump loses, many may conclude his ideological stance on issues like immigration and the economy could have triumphed if the GOP candidate had been someone (like Mike Pence or Marco Rubio) without all of his negatives, such as his treatment of women and his inflammatory comments about Judge Curiel, Megyn Kelly and the Khan family.  \n\n Will there be a governing moment? \n\nThe most difficult aspect of American politics these days is that governing moments are far and few between. In our system of separated and fragmented power, it is always difficult for Washington to pass major legislation. Add to that a toxic partisan atmosphere fed by a 24-hour media, and the forces of gridlock are extraordinarily strong.\n\nGoverning moments are those periods when a crisis or large majorities allow for presidents to move legislation through Capitol Hill. After the plunge in the stock market in 1929 and united Democratic control of the White House and Congress in 1932, the nation saw a New Deal.\n\n As a result of the civil rights movement and the election of 1964, which brought in huge Democratic majorities, Lyndon Johnson presided over passage of a Great Society. With the perception that the economy was in crisis under President Carter and with Republicans in control of the Senate for the first time since 1954, Ronald Reagan found room to push American policy to the right with a massive tax cut. \n\n After 9/11, there was bipartisan support to remake American national security institutions. And in 2009 and 2010 Democratic majorities ushered Obama's domestic agenda through Capitol Hill in the wake of a devastating financial crisis.\n\nIs 2017 a time for action in Washington? Despite all of the bitter divisions we've seen on the campaign trail, there are issues on which it is possible to see the outlines of agreement between the parties.  Trump has drawn enormous support from non-college educated, working-class Americans who are frustrated and angry about the economic insecurity they face. \n\nTrump has spent much time railing against free trade and corporate behavior in a way that resonates with some key themes often voiced by progressive Democrats. Tighter restrictions within free-trade agreements and a higher minimum wage might be appealing to both parties, with Republicans thinking about why Trump drew so much support with his strategy of blue-collar conservatism and Democrats looking to achieve long-held goals. \n\nIf Trump should pull off an upset, he might see a major opportunity to put forth a grand bargain around these economic issues that could prove that he is capable of leading the nation. \n\nStill, at this point it is difficult to see such a moment emerge. For Democrats it seemed possible a few weeks ago. With Donald Trump collapsing in the polls and Democrats picking up steam in the House and Senate races, there seemed to be potential for the kind of outcome America saw in 1964 or 2008 -- a Democratic president elected with a Democratic Congress amid the repudiation of the Republican Party. \n\nBut with the polls tightening after the tumultuous weekend sparked by FBI Director James Comey's letter, and Republican congressional candidates gaining strength in a number of important races, that seems less likely.  \n\nNor does Clinton have the same kind of connection to grassroots movements or overall political vision that has animated some of the legendary presidents. And although the nation faces ongoing challenges, from police brutality against African Americans to economic inequality, most Americans do not feel that they are facing a national crisis akin to the Great Depression or the civil rights turbulence of the early 1960s. Not that we don't face major issues, but the perception is different and that's difficult for political figures to navigate.  \n\nMuch more likely is a standoff between a Clinton White House and a Republican Congress that produces four years of gridlock, obstruction and investigation. Some Republicans have already been talking about the possibility of impeachment. In the Senate, there are open threats that the GOP would not confirm Supreme Court nominees put forward by a President Clinton.  \n\nThere could be a governing moment if Trump defied the polls and won the White House, along with a Republican Congress. Despite all the tensions within the party, polarization and partisan incentive would have a powerful effect on getting the GOP leaders to find common ground. \n\n Will voting rights be suppressed? \n\nFor all the talk of a \"rigged election,\"  the real fear among many political experts is the potential impact of anti-voter-fraud measures that will make it more difficult in many states to vote. For many decades, as Ari Berman and Michael Waldman have recounted in their excellent books, there have been concerted efforts in conservative states to impose measures to make it more difficult to vote. \n\nThe measures were put into effect based on allegations of voting fraud although there has been no solid evidence of that kind of wrongdoing at any serious level. Once the Supreme Court overturned a key part of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby v. Holder (2013), the floodgates opened. Though the courts have knocked down certain voting-rights restrictions, overall the measures remain in place.\n\nOn Election Day, in what Berman called \"The First Presidential Election Since Voting Rights Act Gutted,\" it will be crucial to observe what effect those laws have in states like Texas, North Carolina and Wisconsin. The impact of the laws could be magnified by the fears of intimidation and physical violence that have emerged as a result of Trump's fiery rhetoric, in which he urges his supporters to act as poll watchers. \n\nA little over 50 years since Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act, the question of whether some states, with the consent of the Supreme Court, have successfully undermined the ability of eligible voters to exercise the fundamental right of democracy should be front and center as we search through all the data. \n\nVoter disenfranchisement could also have a very important partisan effect this election. If the polls about a tightening of the race are accurate, any depression of the vote among marginalized and lower income communities could greatly benefit Trump -- a countervailing force to the superior ground organization of the Clinton campaign -- given that Democrats are counting on a robust turnout for victory.  \n\nWe'll start getting the answers to these questions Tuesday night. The results will play a major role in setting up the debates that the next president and Congress will have in the years to come.

Vice President Mike Pence also will join the call.\n\n\"I hear a call was set up and we will see what happens,\" Trump said regarding sanctions during a White House news conference. \n\n\"We're looking to have a great relationship with all countries,\" Trump added. \"If we can have a great relationship with Russia and China and all countries, I'm all for that.\"\n\nHe added, \"How the relationship works out, I won't be able to tell you that (until) later. I've had many times where I thought I'd get along with people and I don't like them at all.\"\n\nTrump also said there was \"no guarantee\" on a path forward.\n\nThe President said he hopes to have a good rapport with Putin but that it was possible they would be adversaries.\n\n\"I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That's possible, and it's also possible that we won't. We will see what happens,\" he said. \n\nObama imposed sanctions on Russia throughout his eight years as president and earlier this month expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the United States for alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nObama's administration also sanctioned a host of Russian banks, defense contractors and energy companies in 2014 for Russia's continued support for separatists in Ukraine and earlier in the year the administration imposed a range of measures, including asset freezes and travel bans, in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\n \n\nTrump spoke warmly of Putin throughout the 2016 campaign, even questioning whether Russian interests hacked Democratic organizations as part of an attempt to influence the election -- a determination made by the US intelligence community.\n\n\"The Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia,\" Trump tweeted earlier this month. \"So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?\"\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump said he didn't think \"anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC,\" arguing instead that it could have been \"somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\"\n\nTrump has also said, as he did earlier this month as a news conference, that if Putin likes him, that is a good thing.\n\nSen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, slammed the Trump administration for considering lifting sanctions on Russia.\n\n\"For the sake of America's national security and that of our allies, I hope President Trump will put an end to this speculation and reject such a reckless course,\" McCain said. \"If he does not, I will work with my colleagues to codify sanctions against Russia into law.\"\n\nMcCain added that it would be \"naive and dangerous\" for Trump to think Putin isn't an enemy to the United States.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed Friday that Trump would speak with Putin on Saturday, as well as leaders from France and Germany.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.8301887512207, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 590, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.14360474955, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170128090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.5423728813559303, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/03/asia/myanmar-alan-kurdi/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1006, "scraper_regex": 1154}}, "headline": "'The Rohingya Alan Kurdi': Will the world take notice now?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1154, "date": "20170103220000", "story_content": "Face down in the mud, a baby boy lies still after washing up on a river bank.\n\nHis name is Mohammed Shohayet, a 16-month-old Rohingya refugee whose family fled their home for Bangladesh to escape the violence in Myanmar's Rakhine State, only to drown during the journey along with his mother, uncle and three-year-old brother.\n\n\"When I see the picture, I feel like I would rather die,\" Mohammed's father, Zafor Alam, told CNN. \"There is no point in me living in this world.\"\n\nThe image has parallels with that of the young Syrian refugee Alan Kurdi, who was found dead on a Turkish beach in September 2015, after trying to flee the civil war at home.\n\nThe conflicts the two boys left behind are different, but the desperation of their families to escape is all too familiar.\n\nMyanmar's Muslim Rohingyas are considered one of the world's most persecuted minorities. The Myanmar government views them as Bengali immigrants, despite the fact that they've lived for generations in Myanmar's Rakhine State. \n\n\"In our village, helicopters fired guns at us, and the Myanmar soldiers also opened fire on us,\" said Alam. \"We couldn't stay in our house. We fled and went into hiding in the jungle.\"\n\n\"My grandfather and grandmother were burnt to death,\" he added. \"Our whole village was burnt by the military. Nothing left.\"\n\n'The military was searching for Rohingyas' \n\nZafor Alam said they ran from village to village trying to escape the violence.\n\n\"I walked for six days. I couldn't eat rice for four days. I could not sleep at all for six days,\" he said. \"We constantly changed our location as the military was searching for Rohingyas.\" \n\nAlam became separated from his family during the journey and made it to the Naf River which runs between Myanmar and Bangladesh. He says he began swimming and was picked up by Bangladeshi fishermen who took him across the border.\n\nThen, he says he started the process to get his family across to safety.\n\n\"I contacted a boatman and asked him to help my wife and sons so that they could cross the river. They were waiting on the other side,\" Alam said.\n\n\"I called (my family) on December 4. They were very desperate to leave Myanmar,\" Alam said. \"They were the last words I had with my family. When I was talking to my wife over phone, I could hear my youngest son calling 'Abba-Abba' (father-father).\" \n\nJust a few hours after that phone call, Alam said his family tried to make their escape. \n\n\"When the Myanmar police got a sense that people were preparing to cross the river, they opened fire,\" Alam said. \"Hurriedly, the boatman took all people on board to escape the firing. The boat became overloaded. Then it sank.\"\n\nA day later, on December 5, he learned what happened.\n\n\"Someone phoned me and said my son's dead body was found,\" Alam said. \"He took a photo of my son by mobile phone and sent it to me. I was speechless.\"\n\n\"It's very difficult for me to talk about my son. He was very fond of his father,\" he added. \"My son was very affectionate. In our village, everyone used to love him.\"\n\n'Only the river knows'\n\nAlam's story of his family being torn apart trying to escape is one familiar to many Rohingya families who have made it across the border to Bangladesh. The International Organization for Migration says some 34,000 people have crossed the border in recent weeks and months.\n\n\"Only the river knows how many dead bodies of Rohingyas are floating there,\" Alam said.\n\nNow at the Leda refugee camp in Teknaf, southern Bangladesh, Alam is struggling to come to terms with what happened.\n\n\"I have no one left. My two sons and my wife died. All are finished,\" he said.\n\n\"We are also suffering here in Bangladesh. There is no house here to live in. There is no food. People who have been living in the camp for a long time, they have given us shelter.\"\n\nBut at least, it's a respite from the violence.\n\n\"We used to live in constant fear of losing our lives in Myanmar,\" he said. \"We don't have any fear in Bangladesh.\"\n\nCNN is unable to independently verify Zafor Alam's account, as access to northern Rakhine State is still heavily restricted.\n\nIn a written response to CNN, Aye Aye Soe, Myanmar government spokesperson, called the testimony \"propaganda\" and \"false.\"\n\nShe did confirm that Myanmar military helicopters fired on a Rohingya village on November 12, but said this was a rescue mission aimed at dispersing an \"armed mob of suspected perpetrators and collaborating villagers\" who ambushed Myanmar troops.\n\nThe Myanmar government has repeatedly denied claims of human rights abuses, saying they are only carrying out \"clearance operations\" against suspects involved in an attack on Myanmar border guards on October 9.\n\nThis week, the government made a rare announcement that it would investigate police brutality after a video emerged showing officers beating Rohingya villagers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Myanmar's government published the results of its interim investigation into the recent violence. The report denied accusations of genocide and said the government was still investigating reports of rape, arson and illegal arrests of the villagers in Rakhine State.\n\n'Nothing has changed'\n\nIn September, the government set up the Rakhine Commission, led by Kofi Annan, to look into problems in the region.\n\nZafor Alam said that the commission is a smokescreen.\n\n\"The commission has been formed to deceive the whole world,\" he said. \"The military drives people out of the villages when the commission visits the area.\"\n\n\"When the elections took place in Myanmar, I thought as Aung San Suu Kyi won, it would be beneficial for us,\" Alam said. \"But the dream and the reality is completely different.

She is denying the atrocities committed by the military,\" he said.\n\nAmnesty International has released a lengthy report which says the \"systematic campaign of violence\" against the Rohingya people \"may amount to crimes against humanity.\" Aye Aye Soe told CNN these claims are \"unsubstantiated.\"\n\nMyanmar state counselor Aung San Suu Kyi held a meeting with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Yangon this month to discuss the situation.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi told the ministers that the government is committed to resolving the issues in Rakhine State, but said that \"time and space are critical for the efforts to bear fruit,\" according to state newspaper The Global New Light of Myanmar.\n\nBut Zafor Alam said allowing the government more \"time and space\" will only end in more bloodshed.\n\n\"I want to let the whole world know,\" he said. \"The Myanmar government should not be given any more time. \n\nIf you take time to take action, they will kill all Rohingyas.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.181818008422851, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1006, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 9, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.44496278573, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170103220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.88270377733598, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/27/us/five-things-tuesday-december-27-2016/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 518, "scraper_regex": 571}}, "headline": "5 things for Tuesday, December 27: Israel, Pearl Harbor, mall fights", "wordcount_as_scraped": 571, "date": "20161227120000", "story_content": "Happy Tuesday from '5 Things' where the number of days we've gone without a typo is 0.

Let's stand together to witness the historic, awe-inspiring sight of the peaceful transfer of power. Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door on this very special day.\n\nHail to the Chief\n\nDonald J. Trump identified, long before anyone else did, the anger and desire for change that millions of Americans craved. He addressed that in frank, blunt terms that deeply resonated with millions who were fed up with Washington's political class and felt left behind in the globalizing economy.\n\nHe easily vanquished a 16-person field of GOP competitors and then beat the Clinton machine in one of the greatest upsets in American political history.\n\nJust before noon today, he'll raise his hand and take the oath of office on the Capitol steps, swearing to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. The 70-year-old Republican will then become our commander in chief, the top executive of the government, the 45th President of the United States. \n\nThe ceremony\n\nThe weather forecast looks gray and damp. The chance of showers will increase throughout the morning -- from around 40% at 7 a.m. to 70 to 80% when Trump takes the oath of office. \n\nHere's everything you need to know about the Inauguration Day schedule. \n\nA little plug for us: You can catch the celebrations everywhere on CNN - on TV, on the homepage of CNN.com and on our mobile apps for iOS and Android.\n\nThe business of governing\n\nTrump will get to the nitty-gritty of governing within hours of taking the oath, saying he'll sign some \"meaningful\" executive orders today. Obamacare, the fight against ISIS, immigration and a lobbying ban are high on the list. Or he may wait until Monday. He told some European newspaper he wants to make Monday his Day 1 because he didn't want to mix the serious work with the weekend's inauguration fun. \n\nThe other side\n\nOf course there are a lot of Americans who are definitely not feeling the love for what's about to go down today. And there could be demonstrations nationwide today. \"Never Trump\" folks like Ana Navarro are coming to grips that he'll indeed become the 45th President today. Her advice? Breathe deep and take a big gulp of your beverage of choice. And for all of you planning to heed social media's call to either not watch or switch channels to sink the inauguration's TV ratings? Just stop it, because it won't work.\n\n        \n\nIN OTHER NEWS\n\nPeople are talking about these. Read up. Join in.\n\nWelcome to the USA\n\n'El Chapo' is on US soil. He was extradited late last night to New York. The timing's no coincidence. The Mexicans didn't want Trump to get the credit.\n\nOne last thing\n\nPresident Obama granted 330 commutations on his last full day in office.

Having fled Saudi Arabia two years earlier, her 7 a.m. appointment would reveal if her application for asylum had been successful or whether she would be forced to leave America.\n\n\"What I really want is just to live normally without fear and not have to pretend to be somebody else, that's all I ever want,\" Arwa told CNN on the eve of her appointment. \n\n\"What really scares me is that I wouldn't get this asylum, and I would be returned and I would die young, and that I would lose everything that I tried to build, that I would just fail.\"\n\nArwa initially came to the US as a student before returning to Saudi Arabia to work for several years. There she says her parents began to turn on her as she began questioning the restrictions placed on women in Saudi society. \n\nHer frustrations grew to the point that one night she sneaked out of her family home and arranged to travel across the border to Bahrain, where she boarded a flight to begin her journey to the US.\n\nLeaving her home and Saudi Arabia were against the wishes of her father, who is also her legal guardian, and doing either could have landed her in jail. \n\nEvery woman in Saudi Arabia, regardless of age, has a legal male guardian, often a father or brother or son. Guardians have the power to make a range of critical decisions on a woman's behalf. Women need to get their permission to travel abroad, marry and sometimes to work or access health care.\n\nThe guardianship system is \"the most significant impediment to realizing women's rights in the country,\" Human Rights Watch said in a report released in July. \n\nThe report helped inspire a social media campaign among Saudi women calling for an end to the system.\n\nThroughout the summer Saudi women began tweeting, detailing the injustices of the guardianship system -- risking the wrath of their guardians and the government in doing so.\n\nThey got noticed. In September, the country's most senior religious authority, the Grand Mufti, described the social media campaign as a \"crime targeting the Saudi and Muslim society.\" But they haven't stopped.\n\nLeaving Saudi Arabia\n\nCNN previously spoke to five Saudi women involved in the campaign. One of those women, Moudi, has since left Saudi Arabia and, like Arwa, has decided to seek asylum in the US. Moudi recently began her asylum application. \n\nIt's not common for Saudis to seek asylum in the US. Between 2011 and 2005, more than 250,000 asylum applications were made to the United States, 111 were from Saudi nationals, 29 of which were approved, according to figures from the Department of Justice. \n\nIn the same time period, the US granted asylum to 30 British nationals. Britain is another US ally.\n\nUnconventional refugees\n\nArwa, and other Saudi asylum seekers CNN spoke to, do not fit the general stereotype one thinks of when they imagine a refugee. \n\nThey are highly educated, well-dressed, are often able to pay for effective immigration lawyers and can afford to stay in hotels, or with sympathetic friends.\n\nCampaigners say the number of women wanting to get out of Saudi Arabia and fearing for their lives are not reflected in the relatively low number of US asylum application numbers.\n\n\"Many women simply can't get out,\" one campaigner told CNN. \"They do not have the means and they need the permission of their guardian to leave their house or to leave the country.\"\n\nMuhammad Syed, the head of Ex-Muslims of North America, a group that helps former Muslims, told CNN that some Saudi women, who have renounced Islam, decide to relocate to neighboring countries that \"grant apostates more freedoms.\"\n\nBoth Arwa and Moudi left behind families of relative wealth. \n\n\"What good are materials and wealth when we can't be free?\" one of them asked. \n\nTheir exits were facilitated by having previously studied in the US, where they both have a small support network of friends, and the finances necessary to secretly put aside enough to make the move.\n\nRenouncing Islam\n\nWahhabism, the conservative official interpretation of Islam in Saudi Arabia, ensures Sharia Law in the country and helps protect the male guardian system.\n\nArwa and Moudi have both left Islam.\n\nAmong the supporting documents submitted as part of Arwa's asylum application was a copy of a newsletter in which she and two others were declared apostates. \n\nThe short newsletter post, which she said was distributed in her local area, detailed how she and two others from her town renounced Islam on social media. \n\n\"The punishment for it can be death,\" the article reminds its readers.\n\nGoing back is not an option\n\nArwa argued that as she had publicly renounced Islam, had questioned and challenged the country's guardianship system, and had left her home and the country without the appropriate permissions from her guardian, it would not be safe to return.\n\nShe told CNN she feared being punished at home for bringing shame to her family and for not obeying her father, and was fearful the state would prosecute her if she did not return to Islam.\n\nEchoing Arwa's fears, Kristine Beckerle, who monitors the guardianship system as part of her work with Human Rights Watch, told CNN: \"Saudi Arabia has and continues to arrest, prosecute and imprison dissidents, including women's rights activists, who then, if they are imprisoned, need a male guardian to agree to their release.\"\n\nCNN asked the Saudi government if women such as Arwa and Moudi who had renounced Islam and had publicly criticized the Saudi government should be fearful of returning to Saudi Arabia. There was no response.\n\nDecision Day\n\nArwa went through the application process without a lawyer. Instead, she relied on friends who had already been granted  asylum, reading advice online, and the moral support of her American boyfriend.\n\nAt the Houston immigration office, she waited patiently, having arrived a few minutes before her 7 a.m. appointment. \n\nHer name was called by a clerk at a booth.\n\n\"Your application for asylum in the United States of America has been successful,\" the official told her. \n\nRelieved, she let out a deep breath and began to cry. \n\nA couple of minutes later, after some forms had been signed and some documents exchanged, she was told she was free to go. \n\nA journey that began with a late-night escape from Saudi Arabia and two years of anxiety seemed to end so simply and so suddenly.\n\nOn her way out, an Iraqi family congratulated Arwa on her asylum, frantically asking her questions about her application as they looked to her as a sign of hope.\n\nOnce outside, she called her boyfriend, told him that she wasn't going anywhere.\n\nThen she got in her car, sat behind the wheel and drove away.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.38297867774963, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1085, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.63782972135, "HarmVirtue": 17, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 53, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170116120000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.88479262672811, "mft_mean": 4.81818181818}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/23/us/beyond-the-call-of-duty-chicago/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 638, "scraper_regex": 676}}, "headline": "Police rally around children found in abandoned home", "wordcount_as_scraped": 676, "date": "20161223160000", "story_content": "Watch \"New Day\" and \"CNN Newsroom\" each Friday to see inspiring stories of officers going above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nChristmas came early for three little girls found in dire circumstances, thanks to the concern and generosity of several Chicago police officers. \n\nThe officers were doing a wellness check last month in the Englewood neighborhood when they found the three children -- ages 1, 2 and 7 -- now known as the \"Englewood angels.\"\n\nThe girls had been left alone in an abandoned house.\n\n\"When I arrived they were all huddled up in a bedroom on a very dirty mattress that was inside one of the bedrooms there,\" Sgt. Charles Artz said. \"The whole house was very uninhabitable. There was no running water, no heat, no electricity. Dirty garbage was spread throughout the apartment. Feces was evident, dead rodents were evident inside the house ... just a very sad, sad situation for three little girls to be in.\" \n\nIt's unclear how long the children had been in the abandoned home.\n\nThe father was accused of striking his children, and charged with eight counts of battery. He has pleaded not guilty. The mother's role in the children's lives is unclear. After getting checked at a hospital, the girls were placed in the care of their paternal grandmother, Delores Anderson.\n\nWhen Anderson first saw how dirty and malnourished they were, she said she felt hurt and disappointed.\n\n\"I'm just glad they are with me now because they had no heat and running water and no one should have to live like that,\" she said. \n\nBut Anderson wasn't in a position to provide for them financially, and she had to quit her jobs to take care of the children. Officer Mimi Bugarin and others joined Artz and immediately wanted to help.\n\n\"I have two daughters myself. It was heartbreaking to see them in the conditions that they were living in. We just knew that we needed to do something more for them,\" said Bugarin.\n\nThey started by dropping off diapers and milk to the girls' grandmother when they were off duty. While off duty, they also started a GoFundMe account that has collected more than $125,000, and they've collected a room full of gifts at the District 7 police station.   \n\nPeople from all over the country and around the world have made donations. \n\nIn the six weeks or so since the girls were rescued, they have gained more than seven pounds each and experienced some of the joys most people take for granted. \n\nOfficer Janice Wilson was especially moved by the fact that the eldest child had never heard of Santa Claus.\n\n\"She had no idea what it was like to be in the presence of Santa Claus and what the purpose of Santa Claus was,\" Wilson said. \"She had never experienced the parts of Christmas. An officer, out of his own pocket, went and bought a tree to donate to the family and they got a chance to experience decorating it. You know, trimming the tree for the first time.\"\n\nThe eldest child also had never been to school. But thanks to the officers of District 7, not only is she in school now, but they've also arranged for her to receive one-on-one instruction to help her catch up with the rest of her classmates.\n\nTheir grandmother, who raised five children of her own, has found sometimes there is a light at the bleakest of times.\n\n\"Of all the things that I have lived through all my life, I never thought there were still so many people in this world that care,\" she said. \"And everything that you see going on in Chicago today, anywhere really, but mostly in Chicago, it just seems like there's no caring, there's no respect, there's no love anymore, and for everybody to reach out, to donate what they can ... food, money, clothing for the girls ... and they try to help me, too, but I don't want anything.

Karoline Foote of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in Japan told CNN in an email.\n\n\"It will be the cornerstone of a multi-mission joint force possessing improved mission flexibility and unprecedented effectiveness to engage and destroy both air and ground threats,\" Foote said.\n\nThe Marines are touting the F-35B's versatility, calling it \"a true force multiplier.\"\n\n\"The unique combination of stealth, cutting-edge radar and sensor technology, and electronic warfare systems bring all of the access and lethality capabilities of a fifth-generation fighter, a modern bomber, and an adverse-weather, all-threat environment air support platform,\" a Marine statement said.\n\nThe single-engine F-35 comes in three variants. The A version is flown by the US Air Force, the B version by the Marines, and the C version will become part of the US Navy's fleet.\n\nThe F-35 is also being sold to and produced by US allies around the world, including Japan, which received its first unit in December.\n\nThe Marines' F-35B differs from the other versions in that it is capable of vertical take-offs and landings so it can operate from amphibious assault ships, essentially small aircraft carriers. It replaces the AV-8B Harrier, which has been around since the late 1970s.\n\nThe Marines said the deployment to Japan is part of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia and not related to any current specific situation.\n\nA statement to allies and foes\n\nBut analysts say the presence of the sophisticated jets in Japan still represents a statement to current and potential adversaries in the region.\n\n\"Operationally, the F-35B has great potential and moving it to Japan does send a signal to North Korea, which has been making a lot of threats lately and of course, China,\" Carl Schuster, a Hawaii Pacific University professor and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said in an email to CNN.\n\n\"There is ... a strategically symbolic facet -- rather than Europe, the Middle East or Australia, it is Asia and Japan that receives the first overseas deployment of the F-35,\" Corey Wallace, Japan security analyst at Freie University in Berlin, said in an email to CNN. \"This signals the priority that the US government and its armed forces place on the alliance at this particular time.\"\n\n\"While the security environment surrounding Japan becomes increasingly severe, the deployment of the most modern and capable equipment to Japan strengthens the deterrence of the Japan-U.S. alliance and contributes to the stability of Asia Pacific region,\" Japan's Ministry of Defense said.\n\nTensions between Japan and China have spiked over the past year as the Pacific powers wrangle over control over the Senkaku Islands, which China calls the Diaoyus, in the East China Sea.\n\nIn October, Japan said it had dispatched its warplanes 407 times between April 1 and September 30 in reaction to increased Chinese military flights near Japanese airspace.\n\nThat's almost double the number of intercepts Japan's Air Self Defense Force made on Chinese aircraft in the same period in 2015. The intercepts have continued into 2017, the most recent being this week.\n\nUS defense officials say the F-35 has the upper hand over top Chinese stealth fighters such as the J-20, which Beijing showed off to the public for the first time in November.\n\n\"When I hear about F-35 versus J-20, it's almost an irrelevant comparison,\"\u00a0US Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein said in August, according to\u00a0a report from BreakingDefense.com.\n\nThe US general said the US F-35 integrates with other US weapons and systems to give it the technological advantage.\n\nFighting a budget battle\n\nWhile the F-35Bs come into a tense situation in the region, the cost of the aircraft has also generated strong headwinds of criticism, including from President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe $400 billion price tag for the 2,443 planes in the US part of the program is double the original budget.\n\n\"It's way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget. I don't like that,\" Trump said in a press conference Wednesday. Trump promised competition for the program to drive down costs.\n\nSen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in April that repeated problems with the F-35 were\u00a0\"both a scandal and a tragedy.\"\n\nBut on Thursday, Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense, former Gen. James Mattis, called the F-35 \"critical\" for US air superiority and for its ability to integrate with allies who are buying the jet.\n\nMany US allies have \"bet their air superiority on the F-35 program. It bonds us tightly together with them,\" Mattis said.\n\nJapan is one of those. In fact, the plane's manufacturer delivered the Japan Air Self-Defense Force its second F-35 on Wednesday. That jet was the 200th delivered from Lockheed Martin's Fort Worth, Texas, production facility.\n\nWallace, the Freie University analyst, said with that commonality between US and Japanese forces, the Japan assignment makes a lot of sense.\n\n\"Since the F-35 will be increasingly integrated into Japan's defense force operations, and one of the key features of the F-35's suite of technologies is its enhanced interoperability with other platforms and across air forces, it's no surprise from an operational and tactical point of view to see F-35s being deployed to Japan at this time,\" he said.\n\nOne of those platforms the F-35 will work with is the Navy's E-2D Advanced Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft.\n\nThe Navy said last week that Advance Hawkeyes, with radar than can detect adversaries' stealth aircraft, will be heading to Iwakuni in February.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.18214936554431896, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 973, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.77214442633, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.5416238437821201, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/09/health/buzz-aldrin-hospital-released/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "A week after Antarctica evacuation, Buzz Aldrin released from hospital", "wordcount_as_scraped": 681, "date": "20161209210000", "story_content": "Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin has been released from a hospital in New Zealand and is on a flight back to the United States, according to a tweet from his manager, Christina Korp. \n\nAldrin, 86, was hospitalized in Christchurch on December 2 after being evacuated from the South Pole when his medical condition deteriorated.

After all, he had spacewalked and was the second man to walk on the moon in the 1960s, traveled underwater to see the Titanic in 1996 and visited the North Pole in 1998. And to scientists, Antarctica's conditions are similar to what they expect on the surface of Mars.\n\n\"I didn't get as much time to spend with the scientists as I would have liked to discuss the research they're doing in relation to Mars,\" Aldrin said. \"My visit was cut short and I had to leave after a couple of hours. I really enjoyed my short time in Antarctica and seeing what life could be like on Mars.\"\n\nRemembering John Glenn\n\nAldrin also honored his friend, former astronaut and US senator John Glenn, who died Thursday. \n\n\"As I sit in hospital and just heard that my friend John Glenn has passed away, I feel fortunate to be recovering from my own illness, but saddened that we lost another space pioneer and world icon,\" Aldrin said on his website.\n\nAldrin met Glenn in 1953, when Aldrin was a fighter pilot in South Korea and Glenn was the Ops officer. They would meet again as astronauts. He said the last time they saw each other was at former astronaut Neil Armstrong's memorial in 2012, but they had kept in touch by phone and email. \n\n\"I was very saddened to hear that John was ill over the past year,\" Aldrin said. \"Since he was the last remaining Mercury astronaut, I was always lobbying him to encourage the Apollo guys to do regular reunions annually since we're not getting any younger. I am very sorry that he has departed us with his wisdom. I join that crowd of people and the entire nation and the world in paying homage to his service.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.7142857313156129, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 649, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.0, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 11, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.69491525423729, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.0}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/05/us/chicago-facebook-live-beating/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1206, "scraper_regex": 1310}}, "headline": "Chicago torture video: 4 charged with hate crimes, kidnapping", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1310, "date": "20170106090000", "story_content": "Four suspects have been charged in connection with the attack on a special-needs teen that was streamed on Facebook Live. \n\nJordan Hill, 18; Tesfaye Cooper; 18; Brittany Covington, 18; and Tanishia Covington, 24, have each been charged with a hate crime, felony aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. \n\nHill, Cooper and Brittany Covington also face charges of residential burglary. Hill also faces charges of possession of a stolen motor vehicle. \n\nVideo of the torture has stunned the country, not just because of the graphic abuse, but because of the comments made by some of the assailants. \n\n\"*F*ck Donald Trump!\" one attacker shouted in the video. \"F*ck white people!\"\n\nThe  teen was tied up for four or five hours, Cmdr. Kevin Duffin of the Chicago Police Department told reporters. The victim will recover from his injuries and is at home with his parents, police said. \n\nThe teen's brother-in-law spoke briefly with reporters Thursday night.\n\n\"We're so grateful for all the prayers and efforts that led to the safe return of our brother. We're fully aware of the charges being brought against the offenders. At this time, we ask for continued prayers for all those involved, for our family's privacy as we cope and heal,\" David Boyd said, reading a statement.\n\nBoyd said the teen is doing as well as can be expected. He told the media that everyone in the family has seen the video, but he didn't comment further on it. \n\nDuffin said the department sought hate crime charges because of the victim's diminished mental capacity, the fact that the four suspects tied him up and the racial epithets heard on the video. The victim apparently is white; the suspects are African-American.\n\nThe suspects will appear in court Friday.\n\nFacebook Live is changing our world -- is that a good thing? \n\n30 minutes of horror\n\nVideo of the attack shows the 18-year-old victim cowering in a corner of a room, tied up with his mouth bound in plastic. His eyes exude fear as his attackers get ready for their next act. \n\nOne assailant slashes his sweatshirt with a knife. The young woman streaming the abuse on Facebook Live repeatedly turns the camera back to herself. \n\nAn attacker then takes a knife to the victim's head, carving a patch off his scalp. \n\nFor the next 25 minutes, the abuse continues for the world to see. The victim is repeatedly kicked and punched, but his screams are apparently ignored. \n\nThe young woman broadcasting the attack appears dismayed that she's not getting more attention online. \n\n\"Y'all not even commenting on my s***,\" she tells a friend during the live stream. \n\nDebate over 'Black Lives Matter'\n\nMany who saw the video have blamed the Black Lives Matter movement. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #BLMKidnapping was mentioned more than 480,000 times on Twitter.\n\nBut on Thursday, police said they have not seen any connection to the Black Lives Matter activist group, contrary to some reports on social media.\n\nNeither the Black Lives Matter national organization nor its Chicago chapter responded to CNN's request for comment Thursday.\n\nBut DeRay Mckesson, a prominent Black Lives Matter supporter, said those linking the attack to the movement don't have their facts straight.\n\nIt goes without saying that the actions being branded by the far-right as the \"BLM Kidnapping\" have nothing to do w/ the movement.\u2014 deray mckesson (@deray) January 5, 2017\n\n\"It goes without saying that the actions being branded by the far-right as the 'BLM Kidnapping' have nothing to do w/ the movement,\" he tweeted.\n\nA former Chicago police officer, Dimitri Roberts, slammed the notion that the Black Lives Matter movement is to blame. \n\n\"This is hate. And hate doesn't have a color,\" Roberts said. \"So for folks to talk about this is somehow connected to Black Lives Matter is absolutely the wrong way to look at this. ...  And we cannot respond to hate with hate. It's just going to perpetuate the cycle.\" \n\nPresident Barack Obama said the Facebook live torture video is \"despicable,\" suggesting to CNN affiliate WBBM it was a hate crime.\n\n\"What we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time,\" said Obama, a longtime resident of Chicago. \"Whether it's tensions between police and communities, hate crimes of the despicable sort that has just now recently surfaced on Facebook.\"\n\n\"The good news is that the next generation that's coming behind us ... have smarter, better, more thoughtful attitudes about race,\" Obama said.\n\nWhat constitutes a hate crime\n\nAccording to the city of Chicago's website, \"Hate crimes are acts of bigotry, and are committed because of the intended victim's actual or perceived ancestry, color, creed, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability (including HIV status), or national origin. Hate crimes not only harm the victim, but also the group in which the targeted member belongs.\"\n\nAnd according to Illinois law, hate can be considered an aggravating factor in a criminal charge and can result in a more severe sentence. \n\nThe fascinating, if unreliable, history of hate-crime tracking in the US\n\nThe assailants made a wide array of statements in the video, including repeated references to Donald Trump, white people in general and the victim's appearance.\n\nHow the encounter started\n\nThe victim's parents reported him missing Monday, telling police they had not heard from their son since dropping him off Saturday at a McDonald's in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg, about 20 miles from their home in Crystal Lake.\n\nThe victim was supposed to spend New Year's Eve with Hill, who picked the teen up in a stolen van, Duffin said. \n\nHill drove the teen around for several days in the van -- they apparently spent at least one night in the vehicle -- before they went to the Covingtons' apartment in Chicago. Police said Hill and the teen were acquaintances who knew each other from school.  \n\nAt one point, Hill and the teen got into a play fight that escalated and he was tied up for hours, police said.\n\nA resident in another apartment complained about the noise and the two sisters went to the home and kicked down the door. The neighbor called 911. \n\nPolice responding to the call found the teen on the street wearing an inside-out tank top, shorts and sandals.\n\n\"He was bloodied, he was battered,\" Officer Michael Donnelly said. \"He was very discombobulated.\"\n\nVideo discovered\n\nPolice in Streamwood, which borders Schaumburg, said that after the man was reported missing to them, his parents began getting text messages from someone \"claiming to be holding him captive.\" \n\nOfficers investigating the texts \"discovered a Facebook video depicting (the man) being verbally and physically abused.\" It's unclear what alerted the police to check Facebook.\n\nSoon after they discovered the video, Streamwood investigators said they were contacted by Chicago police, who said they had found the missing teen.\n\nAfter viewing the Facebook video, they determined the victim was the teen found on the street -- and the people arrested were involved, police said.\n\nVideo pulled from Facebook\n\nFacebook said it pulled the original video from a suspect's Facebook profile.\n\n\"We do not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook and have removed the original video for this reason. In many instances, though, when people share this type of content, they are doing so to condemn violence or raise awareness about it. In that case, the video would be allowed.\" \n\n'Facebook Live' torture video raises ethical questions for social media giant\n\nAccording to its community standards, the company removes content, disables accounts and works with law enforcement in cases of a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety. \n\nFacebook users also can report offensive material to the social platform. If a live stream starts blowing up, Facebook staffers monitor it for possible violations and interrupt it if needed.

Thank you very much, everybody. Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business. Complicated. Thank you very much.\n\nI've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us. On our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign.\n\nI mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.\n\nI mean that very sincerely. Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.\n\nIt is time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be President for all of Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. \n\nAs I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family.\n\nIt is a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs, who want and expect our government to serve the people -- and serve the people it will.\n\nWorking together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business, looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.\n\nThat is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It is going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential.\n\nThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\n\nWe are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\n\nWe will also finally take care of our great veterans who have been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey.The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. \n\nWe will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people, and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It is going to happen. \n\nWe have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be. We will have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. \n\nNo dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.\n\nAmerica will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country, and beautiful things and successful things once again.\n\nI want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. \n\nWe will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict. \n\nAnd now I would like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight a very, very historic victory.\n\nFirst, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. Truly great parents. \n\nI also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. Where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually.\n\nAnd my brother Robert, my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert?\n\nMy brother Robert, and they should be on this stage, but that's okay. They're great.\n\nAnd also my late brother Fred, great guy. Fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky.\n\nGreat brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. \n\nTo Melania and Don and Ivanka and Eric and Tiffany and Barron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough.\n\nThis was tough. This political stuff is nasty, and it is tough. \n\nSo I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group.\n\nYou've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all of the people that we have. Look at all of these people.\n\nAnd Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here, and I want to tell you it's been very, very special.\n\nI want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. He's unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings, and Rudy never changes. Where is Rudy. Where is he?\n\nGov. Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he is as smart as you get. \n\nSen. Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff? A great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? Is that Rudy?\n\nUp here. Really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats, Dr. Ben Carson. Where's Ben? Where is Ben? By the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family Sarah, thank you very much. Gen. Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? And Gen. Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign and they are special people.\n\nWe have 22 Congressional Medal of Honor people. A very special person who, believe me, I read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is ... that's right, how did you possibly guess? Let me tell you about Reince. I've said Reince. I know it. I know it. Look at all of those people over there. I know it, Reince is a superstar. I said, they can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win it. Like Secretariat. He would not have that bust at the track at Belmont.\n\nReince is really a star and he is the hardest-working guy, and in a certain way I did this. Reince, come up here. Get over here, Reince.\n\nBoy, oh, boy, oh, boy. It's about time you did this right. My god. Nah, come here. Say something.\n\nAmazing guy. Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we've done, so I also have to say, I've gotten to know some incredible people.\n\nThe Secret Service people. They're tough and they're smart and they're sharp and I don't want to mess around with them, I can tell you. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down in the seat, but they are fantastic people so I want to thank the Secret Service.\n\nAnd law enforcement in New York City, they're here tonight. These are spectacular people, sometimes underappreciated unfortunately. We appreciate them. \n\nSo it's been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job, and I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job. I look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years or maybe even eight years you will say so many of you worked so hard for us, with you. You will say that --  you will say that that was something that you were --  really were very proud to do and I can \u2014 thank you very much.\n\nAnd I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. We're going to get to work immediately for the American people, and we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your President. You will be so proud. Again, it's my honor.\n\nIt's an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period, and I love this country. Thank you.\n\nThank you very much. Thank you to Mike Pence.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 22, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 4.62085294723511, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1451, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.2005065109, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161109110000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.2053756030323903, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/politics/flag-burning-constitutional-donald-trump/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 709, "scraper_regex": 756}}, "headline": "What the Supreme Court has said about flag burning", "wordcount_as_scraped": 756, "date": "20161129200000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump might not be a fan of burning the American flag, but neither he nor Congress can criminalize it, the Supreme Court has ruled twice. \n\nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning that he would support substantial penalties -- including revoking an American's citizenship -- for burning the US flag, restarting a controversy that has persisted despite decades of settled case law.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled twice that destruction of the American flag is protected by the Constitution, specifically the First Amendment's protection of free speech, even if the act is unsettling. \n\nOne of the staunchest defenders of the decisions, and a key vote in favor of both, was conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who was widely praised by Republicans after his death in February, including by Trump.  \n\nScalia spoke about the matter in a 2012 interview with CNN, saying that while he does not approve of flag burning, it is fundamentally protected by the Constitution and the Founding Fathers' efforts to create a government not ruled by tyranny. \n\n\"If I were king, I would not allow people to go around burning the American flag. However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged -- and it is addressed in particular to speech critical of the government,\" Scalia said. \"That was the main kind of speech that tyrants would seek to suppress.\"\n\nTrump: Burn the flag, go to jail\n\nThe issue has been twice decided by the Supreme Court, which as the nation's highest court has final say on whether laws are unconstitutional. Only an amendment to the Constitution itself, or a subsequent decision by the Supreme Court, would overrule the court's decision.  \n\nThe cases were Texas v. Johnson in 1989, and US v. Eichman in 1990. The former case stemmed from a flag burning protest at the 1984 Republican National Convention and a Texas law banning desecration of a venerated object, and the latter responded to a bill from Congress that made harming the flag illegal. \n\nIn both cases, the Supreme Court ruled that burning a flag is an act of expression and \"symbolic speech,\" and exactly they type of action that the First Amendment was designed to protect. \n\nWhile politicians have continued to introduce bills and proposed constitutional amendments to ban flag burning, they have failed to advance, in large part because of the First Amendment issue.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, himself a staunch Republican who will continue to lead the Senate in Trump's administration next year, opposed banning flag burning in a 2006 op-ed in his home state of Kentucky. He wrote that even if harming the flag is \"offensive,\" the answer is \"more freedom, not less.\" \n\n\"No act of speech is so obnoxious that it merits tampering with our First Amendment. Our Constitution, and our country, is stronger than that,\" he wrote. \"Ultimately, people like that pose little harm to our country. But tinkering with our First Amendment might.\"\n\nWho could be in Trump's Cabinet?\n\nStripping citizenship\n\nIn his tweet on Monday, Trump went farther than saying flag burning should be penalized -- he said it should amount to losing American citizenship.\n\n\"Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag -- if they do, there must be consequences -- perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!\" he wrote.\n\nPunishment for flag desecration itself is outlawed by the Constitution, but stripping citizenship would also be a heavy lift, legally. \n\nThe Constitution provides citizenship to all people born in the US automatically, and also provides for people to become \"naturalized\" citizens if they were not born here. \n\nThe law is different for the two types of citizenship. For a naturalized citizen, the order granting citizenship can be revoked, but the law provides for it only if the citizenship was \"illegally procured\" or obtained through misrepresentation.\n\nFor citizens by birth and naturalization, there is a law that provides for the removal of citizenship for \"voluntarily performing\" certain actions \"with the intention of relinquishing United States nationality.\" Those actions include a formal request to relinquish citizenship, serving in a foreign military that is hostile to the US, and being convicted of treason. \n\nThose laws could be changed by an act of Congress, but would still need to survive a court challenge to their constitutionality if flag burning were included. \n\nThe Supreme Court held in Vance v. Terrazas and, earlier, in Afroyim v. Rusk, that for the law to penalize certain actions with loss of citizenship, those actions must be done voluntarily and with the intent to give up citizenship.

On Tuesday, he and Obama will visit the USS Arizona Memorial and meet to discuss \"joint efforts over the past four years to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance,\" according to the White House. \n\nUS-Japan relations \n\nAbe's planned visit is a way of reciprocating the commitment shown by Obama to Japan-US relations, David Warren, an associate fellow of the Asia program at Chatham House in London told CNN earlier this month. \n\nWhile the visit marks the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, it also comes weeks before the end of Obama's administration and the beginning of Donald Trump's. \n\nAbe was Trump's first in-person meeting with a foreign head of state after clinching the presidency in November. The visit came after Trump's repeated suggestions during the campaign that Japan should shoulder a bigger financial burden regarding US military forces stationed in the region.\n\nAbe had said he had been \"very honored\" to see the President-elect ahead of other world leaders.\n\nRelated: Japan's resurgent military   \n\n\"The Japan-US alliance is the axis of Japan's diplomacy and security. The alliance becomes alive only when there is trust between us,\" he said shortly after his November meeting with Trump. \n\nSince assuming office in 2009, Obama had put US-Japan relations high on his agenda. His administration has shown solidarity with Japan through joint military drills as the Asian nation faces nuclear threats from North Korea and a territorial dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. The Chinese refer to the territories as the Diaoyu Islands.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.555555582046509, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 511, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.4119549331400005, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.870841487279839, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/13/asia/myanmar-rakhine-state-villages/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 585, "scraper_regex": 637}}, "headline": "Myanmar military burned Rohingya villages, Human Rights Watch says", "wordcount_as_scraped": 637, "date": "20161213090000", "story_content": "Satellite images could prove that villages in Myanmar's restive Rakhine State were deliberately burned to the ground, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe organization claims that the timing of the various incidents and their \"spacial trends\" offer evidence of a pattern that is \"consistent with military operations and not random village acts of self-immolation.\"\n\nThe east-to-west movement of buildings that were burned to the ground is consistent with a military sweep, according to Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division.\n\n\"Basic common sense tells you that the military are responsible for this,\" he said.\n\nHuman Rights Watch released before and after satellite images of specific villages it said had been burned.\n\nCNN reached out to Myanmar presidential spokesman Zaw Htay who said the government would respond later.\n\nThe government has previously denied reports that the military was responsible for burning villages, placing the blame on attackers, according to state media.\n\nBut Robertson says the tactic is in line with the scorched-earth modus operandi of the Myanmar military, also referred to as the Burma army.\n\n\"We see the same kind of tactics, the same kind of lies from the Burma army when it comes to these kind of sweeps,\" he said.\n\nThe Rohingya crisis\n\nRakhine state is home to the Rohingyas, a Muslim minority in Myanmar that critics say have a long history of facing persecution at the hands of the country's Buddhist majority.\n\nThe term \"Rohingya\" itself is denied by the government, which regards the group as illegal Bengali migrants.\n\nThe most recent spate of violence began after nine border guards were killed in Rakhine state on October 9.\n\nSince then, the Myanmar military has carried out what it calls \"clearance operations\" targeting suspected \"violent attackers,\" according to state media.

But my optimism had been reignited by the recent establishment of the General Entertainment Authority, as part of Saudi Arabia's \"Vision 2030\" program, which promises a wave of cultural reforms intended to diversify the kingdom's oil-dependent economy.  \n\nAs a filmmaker, I bristled with anticipation. I thought of the day in 2012 when the Saudi Arabian Society for Culture and Arts attempted to host a screening of my film \"Wadjda\" at a small venue in Riyadh to help it qualify for the Academy Awards. \n\nIt was the first film ever shot in the Kingdom, and I was so proud to share it with a Saudi audience. \n\nBut I watched helplessly on social media as bystanders posted videos of bearded men descending on the venue to shut it down. \n\nWe held other screenings in the German and American embassies, but it felt like a dream deferred.  \n\nThis time felt different. Like we had moved on. \n\nWouldn't opening movie theaters be a natural part of any plan to increase domestic entertainment options in a country where people spend most of their time indoors? Does any other country in the world offer a more captive audience? \n\nIt could not only prove to be a huge local industry, but also could be easily controlled to fit our culture. \n\nSo why is it even an issue?\n\n An \"immoral\" threat to traditional values\n\nAfter weeks of hope, the declaration by Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al Sheikh -- the most senior and influential Muslim religious and legal authority in Saudi Arabia -- that cinemas (along with concerts) were \"immoral\" and a threat to traditional values once again broke my heart. \n\nHis comments proved that cinemas remain one of the two \"red line\" issues within Saudi Arabia that transcend rational discourse. \n\nAlong with the issue of women driving, opening movie theaters remains an \"all or nothing\" symbolic issue that we just can't seem to get past.\n\nDespite the many, positive changes that I have witnessed sweeping the country, with women now working everywhere from the malls to the Shura council, for example, and the great strides we have made in modernizing and adapting to the modern age, we seem doomed to be known internationally as \"a country where women still cannot drive and movie theaters are still illegal.\"  \n\nWomen banned from driving\n\nPreventing women from driving is a pretty straightforward issue. \n\nWhile arguably less critical than issues of guardianship or legal representation for women (many legal matters require the approval of a male guardian), it is the one most easily understood internationally as oppressive to the lives of Saudi women. \n\nConservatives see driving as the final firewall against female empowerment. Controlling our physical mobility is the foundation for all other forms of their oppression.   \n\nBut why outlaw cinemas? Aren't Saudis free to watch or listen to whatever they want in the privacy of their homes, as one of the most \"plugged in\" societies in the world? The entire content of the world, uncensored and often free on sites such as YouTube, rests at our fingertips.  \n\nAnd theaters could also be gender segregated the same way all other public areas are divided.\n\nBut that's not the problem.  \n\nIt is a deeper question about the role the arts play in public life in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. \n\nRight now, all forms of art are treated as a threat to our cultural identity.  \n\n\"Saudis are rich in culture\"\n\nThe consequence is that when we see ourselves on the silver screen we see a one-sided, foreign portrayal of Saudis as terrorists, extremists, or culturally primitive outsiders unfit to join the modern world.  \n\nThat is not my country, and that is not our story. \n\nWe are rich in culture, fierce in our humor, burning in intelligence, full of love and hope, and driven by an indelible spirit that cannot be crushed by false narratives or misrepresentation.  \n\nWe are not victims, or extremists, or simpletons.  \n\nThe Kingdom is a rich myriad of peoples, and all of us have important stories, ideas and perspectives. There is a special rhythm to our music and prose, and a tapestry of colors and textures that is uniquely our own. \n\nThis is the Saudi Arabia that I want to show the world through film.  \n\nBut we will never be able to truly showcase our stories with pride, or build audiences eager to see them, until we begin to invest in the necessary physical and intellectual infrastructure.\n\nThankfully, there are a few strong advocates pushing to develop Saudi film. \n\nPrince Al Waleed bin Talal was the only Saudi investor willing to take a chance and support my film. He continues to work at developing the local industry, but we will need more people to join us in this journey if we want our products to truly shine. \n\nWithout cinemas, investment in Saudi film will never flourish. \n\nWithout Saudi film our side of the story will never truly be told. \n\nEditor's note: Haifaa al-Mansour is a Saudi Arabian film director. Her debut feature \"Wadjda\" was the first feature film shot in Saudi Arabia, and the first by a female director. It was submitted by Saudi Arabia in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 86th Academy Awards.

Out of about 472,000 school buses nationwide, 34.7% were owned by contractors, and the rest were owned by school boards or states, the magazine reported.\n\nThat's up from 2007-08, when 25.6% of the nation's school buses were owned by contractors, according to the magazine.\n\nHow many students does Durham serve?\n\nDurham says it gives rides to more than 1 million students every day in 32 states, using more than 16,300 buses.\n\nDurham is a subsidiary of National Express LLC, which says it is the second-largest provider of outsourced school bus services in North America. Durham runs the vast majority of National Express' school bus operations.\n\nHow does Durham fit into the overall picture?\n\nAbout 26 million students ride school buses -- outsourced or not -- in the United States, says the American School Bus Council, a coalition that includes public and private transportation providers. \n\nThe largest outsourcing company, First Student Inc., says it transports about 6 million students per day, using 47,000 buses in 39 states and seven Canadian provinces.\n\nWhat training do contract drivers receive?\n\nStates have varying rules on screening, training and evaluating school bus drivers.\n\nDurham says it meets the rules in every state in which it operates. It says that its drivers, before being hired, must pass a criminal background check, an inspection of his or her driving record and a drug screening.\n\nHired drivers get specialized classroom and behind-the-wheel training, and are subject to an annual driving evaluation, the company says.\n\nWhat is Durham's safety record?\n\nDurham has a satisfactory safety rating from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\n\nThe bus company in 2007 was given a \"conditional safety rating\" from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. It was later upgraded to \"satisfactory\" after the unspecified problems were resolved, said Christopher Hart, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. A website lists the most recent satisfactory rating date as July 31, 2015.\n\nIn the last two years, the company's buses have been involved in 346 crashes before Monday, resulting in four deaths and injuries to about 275 people, the FMCSA says. \n\nThe FMCSA's information makes no comment on the degree to which the buses were involved in the crashes, who was at fault, or whether the dead or injured were on the buses.\n\nThe fatal crashes happened in Memphis, Tennessee, on September 7 (one dead); St. Louis, Missouri, on October 5, 2015 (one dead); and Waterbury, Connecticut, on February 17, 2015 (two dead).\n\nNone of those who died were passengers or drivers of the buses, CNN affiliates reported at the time.\n\nCompare that with the record of the larger contractor, First Student Inc., which the FMCSA also gives a satisfactory safety rating.\n\nFirst Student buses were involved in 886 crashes in the last two years, resulting in six deaths and injuries to about 660 people, according to the FMCSA.\n\nAs for Durham drivers, 53 \"unsafe driving\" violations were reported in the last two years, most of which (30) involved failing to use a seat belt, the administration said. Other of the more frequent violations were failing to obey a traffic control device (eight), using a mobile phone while operating (seven) and following too close (three).\n\nFirst Student had 44 unsafe driving violations in the same period, including 17 for not wearing seat belts, nine for speeding, and four for failing to obey a traffic control device, the FMCSA says.\n\nWhat has Durham said about Monday's wreck?\n\nIn a YouTube statement, Durham School Services CEO David Duke said that, as a father and grandfather, he has struggled to \"get his mind around what happened\" and that he was filled with pain.  \n\n\"I can't fathom the anguish of the parents whose children were involved in this horrific accident and it involved one of my company's buses,\" he said. \n\n\"Nothing that I can say can take away the pain and the grief for these families. What I can say is that I'm deeply sorry for the children that were taken from their families with so much life before them.\"\n\nHe said the company was cooperating with National Transportation Safety Board and local investigators.  \n\n\"My responsibility now is to look for answers -- answers about why this tragedy occurred and answers for how we can make sure that this never, ever happens again,\" he said. \n\n\"I don't want to compromise that investigation. I want to know what happened. I'm not able to elaborate on either the accident or the investigation ... .

That includes most notably what are known as \"Schedule C\" appointments -- more than 1,500 people at mid-level positions who range from policy experts to special advisers to schedulers. Those people are generally chosen by Trump's direct presidential appointees.\n\nAdditionally, there's a federal job category known as the Senior Executive Service, which consists of thousands of upper-level managers. Most are career civil servants, but the president gets to appoint up to 10 percent of those slots as well.\n\nInfluence at agencies large and small\n\nOf the 1,700 people represented here, the departments of Justice and State outweigh other agencies in terms of Senate-confirmed slots Trump will fill. That's largely because at DOJ -- 223 positions -- presidents get to choose every US attorney nationwide, along with the head of each office for the US Marshals. At State -- 269 positions -- the list includes all of the US ambassadors posted around the world.\n\nOther agencies with double-digit numbers of appointments include large departments such as Treasury, Commerce, Energy and Transportation. \n\nBut is also includes ones you may not have thought much about: roughly two dozen jobs at the National Endowment for the Humanities, about a dozen at both the US Postal Service and the American Battle Monuments Commission, as well as eight of nine board members of the Broadcasting Board of Governors.\n\nSafety regulation is one area where Trump appointees could potentially shift policy once five to ten top spots each are filled at places like the National Transportation Safety Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nWorkplace issues that affect millions of Americans could also see potential changes, depending on who Trump decides to appoint to agencies like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, National Labor Relations Board or National Council on Disability. \n\nThen there are more obscure agencies with specific, but influential regional missions: the Farm Credit Administration. The Great Lakes Fishery Commission. The Appalachian Regional Commission. The Marine Mammal Commission.\n\nNo Senate approval needed\n\nWhen it comes to who doesn't need Senate confirmation, it's not surprising the highest concentration is within the White House itself. Trump gets to appoint 129 individuals on his own to the Executive Office of the President, while only 22 require Senate approval.\n\nThere are other federal entities which also are overwhelmingly appointed without Senate approval. \n\nAll but one appointment to the Securities and Exchange commission are done without confirmation (though no more than three commissioners can be from the same party), as are all but one appointee at the Library of Congress. \n\nOther agencies that primarily have appointments without Senate approval include the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, the Commission on Civil Rights, the Arctic Research Commission, and the Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled. (Some of those positions have terms that expire in a staggered fashion over the next couple of years.)\n\nHe will also appoint several dozen members of the US Holocaust Memorial Council when their five-year terms come open again. Just days before he left office, President Obama appointed ten of his own staffers to open spots on the council, so Trump will not get to fill those positions.\n\nPotential flashpoint positions  \n\nFor a campaign that at times expressed skepticism of government-generated statistics, as president Trump will appoint the commissioner of statistics at both the Labor and Education departments.\n\nHe can also name the director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics at DOJ, which does not require Senate confirmation.\n\nA professed skeptic of climate change, Trump will also have the power to appoint positions like the State Department's special envoy for climate change, as well as that person's deputy. \n\nOther climate-related roles within the president's Executive Office include the Special Assistant for Climate Preparedness and Deputy Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change. \n\nFor refugees, Trump has one Senate-confirmed position, the State Department's Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration.\n\nThere are other refugee appointments that fall under the broader categories of noncareer appointees not shown above, such as at the Department of Health and Human Services, where he'll name the both director and deputy director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. \n\nStay tuned.

The nuclear deal itself was a significant contribution to regional security. Both the risk of an Iranian nuclear bomb and a military confrontation with Iran have been significantly reduced. But Trump must now go even further.\n\n A new report, published this week by the National Iranian American Council and signed by 76 national security experts, argues that Trump should take the political risk necessary to broaden the opening to Iran precisely to avoid replicating recent US policy failures in the Middle East.\n\nThis is critical in order to achieve what Trump has listed as one of his priorities: defeating ISIS. Indeed, even if President-elect Trump views the Iran deal negatively, he has to choose between fighting ISIS or scuttling the Iran deal. He cannot do both.\n\nMindful of Iran's role in fighting ISIS -- which Trump publicly acknowledges -- he cannot walk away or renegotiate the nuclear deal without undermining the coalition against the terror group.\n\nTrump has indicated a departure from Obama's calls for Iran and Saudi Arabia to share the balance of power in the Middle East. His top national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has called for regime change in Iran and spoken out forcefully against the nuclear deal. \n\nJohn Bolton, also a national security advisor to Trump, has been saying for years that we should bomb Iran and pursue regime change. Trump himself has said the Iran deal is terrible and we should re-negotiate it, despite American allies and Iran both saying no such re-negotiation is possible. Vice President Pence has previously said the Iran deal would be ripped up.\n\nRhetoric, however, is not preordained to become reality. Policy preferences can change when a new President enters office.\n\nTo that end, if diplomacy could be successful in resolving the most volatile and complex point of tension between the US and Iran -- the nuclear dispute -- Trump should also employ diplomacy to peacefully resolve the remaining differences between Washington and Tehran.\n\nUndoubtedly, this is not a simple proposition. Iran's willingness and ability to engage the US on regional matters has not yet been fully tested. But what remains unquestionable is that it lies in the interest of the US to better manage its ties with Iran so that the two countries have a functional relationship. A quick glance at the geopolitical chessboard demonstrates this necessity.\n\nIran has substantial latent power -- population size and potential for wealth generation -- and thus it is bound to be a leading power in the Middle East. Washington cannot change this. Nor can Washington stabilize the Middle East without Iran's involvement..\n\nIn our report, we provide policy recommendations for eight different dimensions of the US-Iran relationship and flesh out how American national interests can be advanced through concrete short- and long-term measures: from the bilateral relationship with Iran, to the Saudi-Iran rivalry, to the stabilization of Iraq and Afghanistan, to ending the Syrian civil war, to sanctions relief and human rights in Iran.\n\nThe linchpin of regional stability in this new era -- be it Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, or elsewhere -- is ending the Saudi-Iran cold war. Therefore, Trump should directly communicate to Saudi Arabia and Iran that it is in the US national interest to avoid taking sides in aspects of their rivalry in which its own interests are not at stake -- and that it favors d\u00e9tente and rapprochement between the two. \n\nTo that end, the US should encourage Riyadh and Tehran to implement military confidence-building measures in the Persian Gulf; carry out a shared strategy for destroying ISIS; restart Sunni-Shia dialogue to reduce sectarianism and promote tolerance; and urge both sides to conclude an appropriate non-aggression pact.\n\nThe nuclear deal proved that it is possible to change long-contentious aspects of our relationship with Iran using tough-minded diplomacy. The US and Iran may not become the best of friends anytime soon, but they no longer need to be the worst of enemies. Problems will persist, but not to the extent that it requires overlooking or ignoring the substantial number of overlapping interests.\n\nIf Trump squanders this opportunity, the dangers facing America are very real. It will increase the likelihood that the Iran deal collapses, which in turn will lead to Tehran reversing the limitations it made to its nuclear program and escalating its nuclear activities. An Iranian nuclear option will become a near-certainty.\n\nWashington has reiterated countless times its willingness to go to war to stop an Iranian bomb. Eliminating Iran's nuclear program, however, will require a US invasion and occupation of Iran. This sobering reality is what led Barack Obama to wisely pursue diplomacy with Iran in the first place.\n\nWe now know that diplomacy can bear fruit, despite skepticism about Iranian sincerity and the willingness of Iran's leadership to abide by diplomatic agreements. Therefore, Trump should continue transforming US-Iran relations over time and allow the two countries to collaborate when their interests coincide.\n\nThe common fight against ISIS is an obvious starting point.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.5586354732513397, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 876, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.8719162616400005, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161117150000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6529680365296797, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/26/americas/fidel-castro-obit/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1078, "scraper_regex": 2285}}, "headline": "Fidel Castro, Cuba's longtime revolutionary leader, dies at 90", "wordcount_as_scraped": 2285, "date": "20161126070000", "story_content": "Fidel Castro, the Cuban despot who famously proclaimed after his arrest in a failed coup attempt that history would absolve him, has died at age 90.\n\nCastro's brother and the nation's President, Raul, announced his death Friday on Cuban TV.\n\nAt the end, an elderly and infirm Fidel Castro was a whisper of the Marxist firebrand whose iron will and passionate determination bent the arc of destiny.\n\n\"There are few individuals in the 20th century who had a more profound impact on a single country than Fidel Castro had in Cuba,\" Robert Pastor, a former national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, told CNN in 2012.\n\n\"He reshaped Cuba in his image, for both bad and good,\" said Pastor, who died in 2014.\n\nCastro lived long enough to see a historic thaw in relations between Cuba and the United States. The two nations re-established diplomatic relations in July 2015, and President Barack Obama visited the island this year.\n\nPresident Raul Castro -- who took over from his ailing brother more than eight years ago -- announced that breakthrough to the nation but observers noted Fidel's silence on the matter. \n\nCastro's stage was a small island nation 90 miles from the United States, but he commanded worldwide attention. \n\n\"He was a historic figure way out of proportion to the national base in which he operated,\" said noted Cuba scholar Louis A. Perez Jr., author of more than 10 books on the Caribbean island and its history.\n\n\"Cuba hadn't counted for much in the scale of politics and history until Castro,\" said Wayne Smith, the top US diplomat in Cuba from 1979 to 1982. \n\nCastro became famous enough that he could be identified by only one name. A mention of \"Fidel\" left little doubt who was being talked about.\n\nFidel Castro's death prompts mix of joy and grief\n\nCastro and the road to power\n\nIt was a bearded 32-year-old Castro and a small band of rough-looking revolutionaries who overthrew an unpopular dictator in 1959 and rode their jeeps and tanks into Havana, the nation's capital.\n\nThey were met by thousands upon thousands of Cubans fed up with the brutal dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista and who believed in Castro's promise of democracy and an end to repression.\n\nThat promise would soon be betrayed, though, and Castro held on to power for 47 years until an intestinal illness that required several surgeries forced him to relinquish his duties temporarily to younger brother Raul in July 2006. Castro resigned as president in February 2008, and Raul took over permanently.\n\nOne Castro or another has ruled Cuba over a period that spans almost 60 years and 11 US presidents. Fidel Castro outlived six of those presidents, including Cold War warriors John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.\n\nAt the height of the Cold War, Castro used a blend of charisma and repression to install the first and only communist government in the Western Hemisphere, less than 100 miles from the United States.\n\nCuba and the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations on May 8, 1960, further eroding the relationship with the United States. Castro, who had long blamed many of Cuba's ills on American influence and resented the US role in hemispheric politics, quickly intensified cooperation with the Soviet Union, which began sending large subsidies. \n\n\"Fidel Castro came to power with a conviction that he was going to have a major revolution in Cuba, that he was going to stay in power indefinitely, that he was going to fight American imperialism and that he needed a 'daddy' and his 'daddy' was the Soviet Union,\" said Jaime Suchlicki, director of the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami.\n\n'Taunted, antagonized and irritated'\n\nIn doing so, Castro defied a hostile US policy that sought to topple him with a punishing trade embargo that started in 1962 and continued for the rest of his life.\n\n\"He taunted, antagonized and irritated the United States for more than a half century,\" said Dan Erikson, a senior adviser for Western Hemisphere affairs at the US State Department and author of \"The Cuba Wars: Fidel Castro, the United States and the Next Revolution.\"\n\nCastro also survived numerous assassination attempts by the CIA and anti-Castro exiles in the early 1960s. He took delight in pointing out how none of them succeeded, not even the plot that called for explosives to be placed in the ubiquitous cigars he later would quit smoking for health reasons.\n\n\"I have never been afraid of death,\" Castro said in 2002. \"I have never been concerned about death.\" \n\nUntil his last breath, Castro held tightly to his belief in a socialist economic model and one-party Communist rule, even after the Soviet Union disintegrated and most of the rest of the world concluded state socialism was an idea whose time had passed.\n\n\"The most vulnerable part of his persona as a politician is precisely his continued defense of a totalitarian model that is the main cause of the hardships, the misery and the unhappiness of the Cuban people,\" said Elizardo Sanchez, a human rights advocate and critic of the Castro regime.\n\nBut Castro's defenders in Cuba point to what they see as social progress, including racial integration, universal education and health care. Instead of blaming an inept socialist system, they fault the US embargo for the country's economic woes.\n\n\"What Fidel achieved in the social order of this country has not been achieved by any poor nation, and even by many rich countries, despite being submitted to enormous pressures,\" said Jose Ramon Fernandez, a former Cuban vice president.\n\nCuban exiles\n\nCastro's political staying power was a source of puzzling consternation and bitter frustration for Cuban exiles, who never imagined he would rule so long.\n\n\"We came here with a round-trip ticket ... because we thought the revolution was going to last days,\" said US Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who arrived in Florida as a child and later became the first Cuban-American elected to Congress. \"And the days turned into weeks, and the weeks to months, and the months to years.\"\n\nCastro occasionally allowed disenchanted Cubans to leave, with most going to the United States. More than 260,000 Cubans left in a US-organized airlift between 1965 and 1973. In 1980, Castro let another 125,000 leave in the chaotic Mariel boatlift. Among them were criminals released from Cuban jails who brought a violent crime wave to Florida.\n\nAt other times, desperate Cubans fled the island nation in makeshift boats across the treacherous Straits of Florida. Thousands died from drowning or exposure to the brutal Caribbean sun.\n\nThe center of the exile community is Miami, where the Cuban American National Foundation became a powerful lobbying group courted by US politicians. For decades, pressure and political donations from the exile community have thwarted any efforts to lift the embargo.\n\nThe early years\n\nCastro was born August 13, 1926, in Oriente Province in eastern Cuba. His father, Angel, was a wealthy landowner originally from Spain. His mother, Lina, had been a maid to Angel's first wife.\n\nEducated in private Jesuit schools, Castro went on to earn a law degree from the University of Havana in 1950 and became a practicing attorney, offering free legal services to the poor.\n\nIn 1952, at the age of 25, he ran for the Cuban congress. But just before the election, the government was overthrown by Batista, who established the dictatorship that put Castro on the road to revolution.\n\nOn July 26, 1953, Castro led a group of about 150 rebels who attacked the Moncada military barracks in Santiago in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow Batista. Most of the attackers were killed. Castro and a handful of others were captured.\n\nThe attack made him famous throughout Cuba, but it also earned him a 15-year prison sentence.\n\nAt his sentencing, Castro told the court, \"Condemn me, it doesn't matter. History will absolve me.\"\n\nHe was released in 1955 as part of an amnesty for political prisoners and lived in exile in the United States and Mexico, where he organized a guerrilla group with brother Raul and Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, an Argentine doctor-turned-revolutionary. They named themselves the July 26 Movement, after the date of the failed Moncada attack.\n\nIn 1956, Castro and a few dozen rebels headed for Cuba aboard an old yacht called the Granma. Off course and long overdue, they beached the craft off the coast of Oriente Province.\n\nBatista's soldiers were waiting for them, and, again, most of Castro's followers were killed.\n\nThe Castro brothers, Guevara and a handful of other survivors fled into the Sierra Maestra mountains along the nation's southeastern coast, where they waged their guerrilla campaign against Batista.\n\nRelations quickly fell apart\n\nWhile the United States quickly recognized the new government when Castro came to power on January 1, 1959, tensions arose after Cuba began nationalizing factories and plantations owned by American companies. In January 1961, Washington broke off diplomatic relations. \n\nLess than four months later, a group of CIA-trained Cuban exiles, armed with US weapons, landed at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba in an attempt to overthrow Castro. The invasion failed miserably, with many of the exile fighters killed or captured.\n\nThe United States later paid $53 million worth of food and medicine in exchange for more than 1,100 prisoners.\n\nTwo weeks after the Bay of Pigs, Castro formally declared Cuba a socialist state.\n\nIn October 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union came to the brink of nuclear war over Soviet nuclear missiles installed in Cuba. President John F. Kennedy demanded that the Soviets remove the weapons, and he established a naval blockade around the island. In the end, the Soviet Union backed down and removed the missiles.\n\nCuba, which had struggled economically despite the Soviet subsidies, underwent even more severe hardships starting in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By some accounts, imports and exports dropped by 80%, and the gross domestic product, a measure of the goods and services the nation produced, fell by more than 30%. This Special Period in Time of Peace, as the Cubans called it, lasted through the decade, and Cuba continued to struggle well into the 21st century.\n\nCounterfactual Files: What if the Cuban Missile Crisis had escalated?\n\nA private life kept private\n\nNot much is known about Castro's private life, which he guarded steadfastly.\n\nBefore he came to power, Castro married Mirta Diaz-Balart, the daughter of an established and politically connected Cuban family, in 1948. They had a son the next year and named him Fidel. \n\nHis wife filed for divorce in 1954 and won custody of young Fidelito, as he was known. \n\nCastro is reported to have fathered 10 children with six women. His second wife, Dalia Soto del Valle, is the mother of five of his eight sons. Seven of his 10 children have names that begin with the letter A.\n\nToward the end of his life, Castro grew visibly weaker, spurring speculation about his health. He fainted while speaking at a rally in June 2001 and injured himself when he fell after a speech in late 2004.\n\nHe remained mostly out of sight after falling ill in 2006 but returned to the public light in the summer of 2010, making a series of appearances and even giving a short speech to a special session of the National Assembly that he convened. In January 2014, photos showed a frail and hollow-eyed Castro hunched over a cane and supported by an aide as he toured an art studio opening in Havana.\n\nA divisive figure in life, Castro will likely remain so for many years after his passing.\n\n\"The legacy of Fidel Castro will not really be known until 50 years after his death,\" said Cuba scholar Perez.\n\nAnn Louise Bardach, author of the 2009 book \"Without Fidel: A Death Foretold in Miami, Havana, and Washington,\" spent more than two decades following and writing about the Castros and Cuban politics.\n\n\"The possible aspects of his legacy,\" she said, \"will likely be nationalism, a sense of Cuban identity -- of 'cubanidad.' But at a price far too steep that will leave a debt for generations to come.\"\n\nErikson, the State Department official, noted Castro's shortcomings.\n\n\"He really was the main proponent of the Cuban Revolution,\" Erikson said, \"but he failed to deliver on his promises.\"\n\nAssessing a mixed legacy\n\nCastro clearly left behind a different Cuba, many observers say, but not necessarily a better one.\n\n\"You could say that one positive legacy is that there are a lot of educated Cubans,\" said Adriana Bosch, a Cuban-born filmmaker who lives in the United States and produced a documentary on Castro for PBS.  \"But if you don't create the economic conditions where those people can work and make contributions, what you have is a bunch of educated waiters and waitresses, which is what you have in Cuba now.\"\n\nThe enduring legacy, Castro's critics say, is a society in disarray.\n\n\"Cuba is a country divided, a country where you have 2 million people in exile, a country that is economically wrecked, a country that is ecologically wrecked, a country that is probably without a lot of civic values, and a country that is facing a very uncertain future,\" Bosch said.\n\n\"Many of the decisions that have been taken by the leadership and by Fidel Castro were not necessarily the decisions that were best for the revolution, but were decisions geared to keeping him in power,\" Lisandro Perez, a Cuba expert at Florida International University, told CNN.\n\nIn the end, Castro's declaration decades ago that history would issue the final verdict was accurate. Time will tell, but at the end of his long life, it appeared he would not be absolved.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 25, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.77386951446533, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1078, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.907894633280001, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 25, "mft_sum": 45, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161126070000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.090909090909999, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.174397031539891, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/04/politics/trump-china-tweets/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 655, "scraper_regex": 885}}, "headline": "Trump takes fresh swipe at China after controversial Taiwan call", "wordcount_as_scraped": 885, "date": "20161205040000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump has taken a fresh swipe at China just two days after a controversial phone call with Taiwan's president that upended decades of diplomatic protocol. \n\nTrump, in two tweets late Sunday, accused China of keeping its currency artificially low and of military posturing in the South China Sea -- home to a tense territorial dispute. \n\n\"Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the US doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?

The two sides split in 1949 after Communist victory in the civil war. \n\n10-minute call that could change history\n\nThe 10-minute conversation with President Tsai Ing-wen, which Trump described as a congratulatory call, was the first time a US president has spoken to Taiwan's leader since Washington established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979.\n\nBeijing rattled?\n\nIt's unclear to what extent Trump's latest comments will rattle Beijing, which had a fairly muted stance to Friday's phone call. \n\nForeign Minister Wang Yi said Saturday it was a petty gambit and China lodged an official complaint. \n\nA front-page opinion piece published Monday on the overseas edition of the People's Daily -- the Communist Party's official mouthpiece -- said the call set a bad precedent.  \n\n\"Trump's unconventional move on Taiwan did ring a warning bell for the direction of Sino-US relations. China will not take it lightly,\" the paper said.\n\nLu Kang, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, declined to comment specifically on the latest tweets. He said Monday that China didn't comment on a politician's style or personality and only cared about their policies. \n\n\"The whole world is clear on the Chinese government's position on Taiwan, and that includes President-elect Trump and his team,\" Lu said, adding that China maintains contact with President-elect Trump and his team.\n\nVictor Gao, a Chinese international relations expert and former translator to late Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, said that Trump could say what he liked as President-elect but his comments would have huge global consequences once in office. \n\n\"We hope President-elect Donald Trump, who will very soon go into (the) White House, will handle himself with respect, accountability and responsibility and become a force of peace and stability rather than making whimsical and capricious remarks aimed at surprising the world,\" he said.\n\nTrump's remarks on China's currency aren't dramatically different from his campaign trail rhetoric, however, it's only the second time that Trump has weighed in on the South China Sea dispute. \n\nTensions have ratcheted up in the waters, which are a major shipping route, as China has conducted massive dredging operations to reclaim land around territory it controls, turning sandbars into islands equipped with airfields, ports and lighthouses.\n\nBeijing has also warned US warships and military aircraft to stay away from these islands.\n\nTrump risks reigniting Asia's most dangerous flashpoint\n\nConsidered shift?\n\nIt was unclear to what extent the phone call with Tsai signaled a considered shift in US-China policy by Trump and his transition team. \n\nTrump tweeted that Tsai had called him but Taiwan's Presidential spokesman Alex Huang told CNN that both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact, but would not give any further details including exactly when they agreed to the call.\n\nWhy chat could rock the boat\n\nChristopher Hill, a former US ambassador, said that Trump was \"winging it\" and may not have been aware of the significance of the move.  \n\n\"It was an example of what is all too often happening now with this incoming administration, this tendency to wing it,\" he told CNN's Erin Burnett. \"What I'm concerned about is that rather than acknowledge a mistake, they will double down on it.\"\n\nBut criticism hasn't been universal. Others have welcomed the prospect of better ties with Taiwan -- a  boisterous, multi-party democracy that stands in sharp contrast to China, a one-party state whose rulers are tightening their grip on dissent.\n\nMichael Pillsbury, a China adviser to Trump during the campaign who served under Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Obama, said Trump's call was like many of the dozens he had made and taken since Election Day with world leaders.\n\nTrump's Taiwan call: Analysts weigh in\n\n\"It shouldn't be seen as a departure from norms,\" Pillsbury said. \n\n\"We should have warmer ties with Taiwan. And it can be done without alienating Beijing. Indeed over the last decade, Taipei has pursued closer relations with the mainland. We too can do both. The zero sum mentality is an old way of thinking.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.81355929374695, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 655, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.953462589246, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 11, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.6793893129771, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/politics/arizona-ballot-collection/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 642, "scraper_regex": 567}}, "headline": "Supreme Court allows Arizona 'ballot collection' law", "wordcount_as_scraped": 567, "date": "20161104230000", "story_content": "The Supreme Court on Saturday allowed an Arizona law barring organizers from picking up ballots and delivering them to election stations to remain in effect.\n\nThe ruling is a blow to Democrats in the state who say the law could disenfranchise thousands of voters, especially in minority communities that rely upon neighbors and activists to collect and hand-deliver the ballots.\n\nFriday, a 6-5 ruling by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals granted a preliminary injunction of the law; the Supreme Court's order stays that decision.

But only if you do it accidentally.\n\nLawmakers in that state are set to vote Friday on a bill that would legalize accidentally running over protesters in the road, one of several new measures across the country that aim to discourage disruptive protests. \n\nRep. Keith Kempenich introduced the North Dakota bill, which states that if a driver \"unintentionally\" causes injury or death to someone blocking traffic on a roadway, then the driver will not be liable for damages.\n\nKempenich said he was spurred to act after Dakota Access Pipeline protesters last year moved to block public roadways, scaring some of his constituents.\n\n\"It turned from a protest to basically terrorism on the roadways, and the bill got introduced for people to be able to drive down the roads without fear of running into somebody and having to be liable for them,\" he told CNN.\n\nIt's not just North Dakota that's cracking down on protesters. Other communities that have endured multiple or prolonged protests are fighting back by trying to put similar laws on the books. \n\nIn recent weeks legislatures in Minnesota, Indiana and Iowa have moved to add laws specifically targeting roadway blocking. The proposed bills have dismayed the American Civil Liberties Union, which fears they would trample First Amendment rights.\n\nKempenich argued that any drivers who intentionally targeted protesters would still be prosecuted.\n\n\"If people stay off the roadway, it has nothing to do with you,\" he said. \"[But] if you're on the roadway trying to intimidate some people, then you've got an issue.\"\n\nMinnesota protest bill gets its own protest\n\nThe North Dakota bill comes amid contentious protests related to the proposed construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, or DAPL. The pipeline, which would stretch south to Illinois, has largely been completed except for a hotly contested stretch near the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's reservation. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday to advance the stalled project. \n\nBut roadway protests are a hot topic in Minnesota, too.\n\nThere, a Republican-led House committee passed a measure Tuesday that would allow local governments to sue criminally convicted protesters for law enforcement costs.\n\nShortly after the measure passed by a 9-6 vote, protests erupted as members of the public angrily shouted at lawmakers, according to CNN affiliate WCCO. \n\nOne of those protesters was a friend of Philando Castile, the man shot and killed by a St. Anthony police officer during a traffic stop last summer. That shooting sparked a series of protests in Minnesota led by the Black Lives Matter movement, which advocates for social justice for African Americans.\n\nRep. Nick Zerwas, a Republican who introduced that measure, said the public should not have to pay to cover law enforcement costs incurred dealing with illegal protests. \n\nThe local governments are only able to recoup costs if the protester is convicted of a crime, he said. \n\nZerwas is also behind a measure that would increase the criminal penalties in Minnesota for blocking traffic on a roadway.\n\n\"If you want to block a freeway, you're going to jail, and when you get out, you're gonna get a bill,\" he said.\n\nRep. John Lesch, a Democrat who voted against the measure, said lawmakers were using \"overzealous intimidation tactics to suppress speech\" and argued that the measure is unconstitutional.\n\nEffective protest movements, such as the Civil Rights-era boycott of buses in Montgomery, Alabama, are necessarily disruptive, he said.\n\n\"Inconvenience is at the heart of protest,\" he said. \"If you're not being inconvenienced, the likelihood of you listening is drastically lower. So it's remarkable that all these unarmed young black men were being shot all over the nation and no one cared until you had to take a detour to get to the mall.\"\n\nBlack Lives Matter Minneapolis posted its opposition to the measure on Facebook.\n\n\"This is not a post of defeat. This is a warning to those trying to take away our freedom. We Ready. We Coming,\" the group wrote.\n\nAn 'alarming' trend?\n\nOther states are considering similar bills.\n\nIn Indiana, a lawmaker proposed a bill that would require officials to direct police to clear protesters from roadways by \"any means necessary,\" according to the Indianapolis Star. Action on the bill was deferred until a later date.\n\nA lawmaker in Iowa, too, told the Des Moines Register of plans to propose a bill that would make it easier for law enforcement to push criminal charges on those who block roadways.\n\nBut at least one rights group is dismayed by the flurry of proposed laws.\n\n\"We are seeing an alarming trend of state bills introduced with the purpose or effect of criminalizing peaceful protest \u2014 an act that lies at the very core of the First Amendment's protections,\" Lee Rowland, senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, told CNN in an email.\n\nRowland said these proposals, if passed, will \"undoubtedly\" be struck down by courts for violating the First Amendment.\n\n\"Legislators are supposed to honor the will of the people, not criminalize it,\" she added.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 5, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.35214424133301, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 826, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.1046976186900004, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.38983050847458, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/trump-immigration-refugees-visa-policy/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1073, "scraper_regex": 1201}}, "headline": "What to know about Trump's visa and refugee restrictions", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1201, "date": "20170128130000", "story_content": "President Donald Trump's road to the White House was paved in part with hard-line promises such as building a \"great, great wall\" along the US-Mexico border and outright banning immigration from any nations \"compromised by terrorism.\"\n\nAfter a week in office, Trump has sought to make these dramatic steps the pillars of his national security policy, scrawling his signature on executive orders aimed at reshaping immigration across the United States.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the latest controversial actions.\n\nWhat immigration restrictions are under consideration?\n\nAn executive order signed by Trump on Friday bans all people from certain countries from entering the United States for 90 days. The text of the order doesn't name the countries, but a White House official said they are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.\n\nFull text of Trump's executive order\n\nThe same order also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated for nationals of countries that Trump's Cabinet believes can be properly vetted.\n\nThe total number of refugees admitted into the United States will be capped during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump vowed to ban Muslim immigrants from countries with a \"proven history\" of terrorism against the United States or its allies.\n\nFriday's executive order gives the Department of Homeland Security leeway to prioritize refugee claims \"on the basis of religious based persecution\" as long as the person applying for refugee status is \"a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\"\n\nThat would make it easier for Christians and other religious minorities in majority-Muslim countries to enter the United States than it would for Muslims in general.\n\nTrump's order also cancels the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which once allowed repeat travelers to the United States to be able to forgo an in-person interview to renew their visa. Under the new order, these travelers must now have an in-person interview.\n\n\"We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,\" the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. refugee agency said in a joint statement.\n\nWhat's the reaction to his plan?\n\nAbed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said Trump's actions were \"tantamount to a Muslim ban.\" \n\n\"In our view, these actions taken by Trump and this administration have nothing to do with national security,\" he said. \"They're based off Islamophobia, they're based off of xenophobia, and we cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nJustin Cox, a staff attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, agreed. \n\n\"This is a Muslim ban,\" Cox said. \"It doesn't say that in those words, but those seven countries are Muslim-majority.\"\n\nThe National Iranian American Council, for instance, pointed out that all seven nations have Muslim-majority populations. \n\n\"We agree with the goal of making America safe from terror, but a blanket ban based on national origin does nothing to achieve that objective,\" the council's statement said.\n\nHow many people come to the US from countries Trump is targeting? \n\nIn the last fiscal year, 43% of refugees admitted into the United States came from the seven countries that could be affected by restrictions, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center. \n\nThe Obama administration had pushed to resettle at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the United States as part of humanitarian efforts in 2016.\n\nDuring fiscal 2016, which began October 2015 and ended September 2016, the United States admitted the following number of refugees from the seven countries: 9,880 from Iraq; 3,750 from Iran; 1 from Libya; 9,020 from Somalia; 12,587 from Syria; 1,458 from Sudan and 26 from Yemen. \n\nAre other types of visas available? \n\nApart from refugees, there are also other types of visas issued by the United States. Here are the number of total US non-immigrant and immigrant visas issued to the affected countries in 2015: 15,509 to Iraq; 42,542 to Iran; 3,575 to Libya; 1,409 to Somalia; 11,962 to Syria; 2,153 to Sudan and 7,668 to Yemen.\n\nWhat do critics of the resettlement effort say? \n\nThe issue is a major domestic political flashpoint. Critics like Trump and several Republican governors have expressed concern about the potential for ISIS or other terrorist groups to exploit refugee flows to reach the West.\n\nMigrant crisis: 2016 is the deadliest year for Mediterranean\n\nIs it legal?\n\nHours after Trump signed the executive orders, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) announced it will mount a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the order.\n\nCAIR said more than 20 plaintiffs have joined the suit, the details of which will be announced Monday.\n\n\"The courts must do what President Trump will not -- ensure that our government refrains from segregating people based on their faith,\" said Gadeir Abbas, co-counsel on CAIR's lawsuit.\n\nStill, the Immigration and Nationality Act grants broad-ranging powers to the President: \n\n\"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,\" part of the act reads.\n\nThis suggests Trump has a lot of leeway.\n\nBut another section of the law, which was passed in 1965 during the Civil Rights movement, states that \"no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.\"\n\nIn an analysis piece, David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, wrote that such protection extends to green card holders and may not extend to non-immigrants such as refugees, asylum seekers, guest workers, tourists and temporary visitors.\n\nWhat will be some effects of these actions? \n\nMelanie Nezer, vice president for policy and advocacy at HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit, said Trump's actions could be devastating for refugees. \"People will literally, if this goes through, not be allowed to get on planes, or arrive in the US and be told they have to go back,\" she said. \n\nShe said she wonders whether refugees who have already been approved for travel to the United States will have their papers revoked.\n\n\"So maybe they've given up their housing,\" Nezer said. \"Maybe they're waiting at the airport and everything has been sold.\"\n\nSaid Cox, \"It could have real consequences for individuals who have been issued visas and are making their way to the United States right now. They could conceivably be denied entry at airports or at the border.\" \n\nIs there precedent for this? \n\nPresident George W. Bush suspended refugee admissions for three months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks while certain safeguard were put in place.\n\nHowever, banning people from specific countries is new.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any prior such edict from the president saying that people from a particular country aren't permitted to be admitted as refugees,\" Cox said.

In 2015, the Houston Chronicle dubbed \"rumors about Sharia courts\" their hoax of the year.\n\nCNN's KFile first reported Tuesday that in a speech in August, Flynn falsely claimed that Florida Democrats voted to impose Islamic Shariah law at the state and local level.

The agency uses the transition, that interregnum between the election and the inauguration, to get to know the new President and discern from all sources what are the best ways to serve the President's needs.  The CIA is always eager to put its best foot forward by showing its willingness to support the new President and his team, convince the new chief executive that it is worth the money in terms of manpower and budget, and look for ways to ingratiate itself with the new national security crowd.  \n\nHowever, this year things seem different.  Rather than extensive courting, the transition to a Trump presidency seems to have all the charm of a hostile takeover.\n\nPresident-elect Trump and the CIA are not immune to the hyperpartisan political atmosphere that dominated the 2016 election. In theory, politics should stop at the agency's edge once the new President has been chosen by the American people.  The agency should provide the incoming administration with just the facts without worrying about the politics of the moment. However, the 2016 presidential campaign placed the agency and its record of failure on the map with voters like never before.  Trump has made controversial statements, both during the campaign and after his election win, that probably has the denizens of the seventh floor of Langley very nervous. Most recently: dismissing the CIA's claims of Russian intrusion into the presidential election and calling for expanding US nuclear weapons capability. \n\nThe public spat between Trump and the CIA is just another example of the politicization of intelligence, a process that harms our intelligence community while aiding our enemies.  \n\nPoliticization of intelligence is not a new concept and probably has been going on for as long as leaders have been seeking secret information about adversaries and allies alike.  During my years at the CIA, I came across numerous examples of administration meddling in intelligence and, basically, only listening to the things they wanted to hear.  \n\nThe CIA that I knew was the one I was proud to join in 1998, when we were told to \"dare to be wrong\" and encouraged to push our analysis further to try to see more than one side of the equation.  The agency that I left 13 years later was different: afraid to say anything for fear of being pilloried in the press. Most importantly, the CIA I joined praised expertise, something that became less important as the agency hunkered down and bent over backward to please the White House.  \n\nIn my recent book, for example, I talk about the war in Iraq and how my conversations with Saddam Hussein in captivity laid waste to the administration's often repeated claims of Iraq being a growing threat to the United States.  The result of those claims was a disastrous war that served as an incubator for instability, terrorism throughout the region, and the rise of Iran as a regional hegemon -- problems that we will be dealing with for many years to come. \n\nThe key imperative to remember here is that, like it or not, both the President and the CIA need each other.  President Trump will soon realize the agency can help him realize his as-yet unstated foreign policy goals -- if he lets it. In return, the President needs to support and protect members of the intelligence community as best he can from the partisan conflict raging daily on the airwaves and over the Internet.  For the CIA to do its job, it must have the trust and confidence of its No. 1 customer, the President of the United States.\n\nIf I had one bit of advice I could give to the new President-elect, it would be this: Mr. Trump, it is a complex world out there that gets more complicated every day.  If someone tells you there are easy solutions to tough questions, they're simply wrong. And take the intelligence briefings \u2014they're a useful first step.

It begs the question: Who exactly is going to be the first lady come noon January 20?  The answer, I think, is no one. Melania may prefer, it seems, to remain in New York with son Barron, but that doesn't make Ivanka the de facto first lady. It makes her someone potentially much more publicly powerful.\n\nIvanka is more than a first daughter and more than a first lady: She is her father's most effective public defender and she humanizes him in a way Melania cannot. Melania's decision to stay in New York while her son finishes the school year does leave a vacuum for the position of first lady, but Ivanka will be far too busy to be her father's helpmate. She'll be meeting with high-profile Democrats like Leonardo DiCaprio, with whom she reportedly has already met, who see her as their lifeline to her father's administration. The Trumps' social secretary will have to take the lead and have final say on guest lists and china patterns. \n\nThis isn't the first sign that Ivanka's influence on her father outpaces that of her stepmother. After Melania was criticized for cribbing parts of her remarks at the Republican National Convention from first lady Michelle Obama, Ivanka positioned herself as the moderate in her father's circle during her own speech at the convention, in which she spoke out strongly for progressive values like child care tax credits. \n\nMelania was conspicuously absent when her husband announced Mike Pence as his running mate, marking the first time in modern campaign history that the wife of a presidential candidate was not there for the public announcement. Of course Ivanka and Jared stood gamely by Trump's side. \n\nTraditionally, most children of presidential candidates have shown a general reluctance to engage in the blood sport of politics. Before George W. Bush decided to run for president in 2000, Jenna Bush pleaded with her father, \"Oh, I just wish you wouldn't run. It's going to change our life.\" \n\nThere have been some first daughters who have played a role in their fathers' administrations, usually as White House hostess when their mothers were unavailable. Martha Jefferson Randolph, whose mother died almost 20 years before Thomas Jefferson was inaugurated, did so, as did Margaret Truman, whose mother, Bess, often left Washington for the calm of her home in Independence, Missouri. \n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, there were a slew of young adult children living in the White House. These presidential offspring offered advice but they were largely confined to the campaign and were not considered top White House advisers. \n\nLuci Johnson, LBJ's youngest daughter, said her father would grade the campaign speeches she made on his behalf.  President Gerald Ford's son, Steve, was 18 years old when his father pardoned President Nixon, a month after Nixon announced his resignation.  Steve advised against it and told his father: \"They're going to crush you if you pardon Nixon.\" The Reagans' son, Ron, remembers getting into a heated debate about the Iran-Contra affair with his parents in the White House residence. \n\nBut there has never been a first daughter who was also a serious political adviser -- and certainly not like this, where the lines of business interest, of politics, and of diplomacy are so thoroughly blurred between family and the West Wing. \n\nTrump is also the oldest elected president in American history. At 70 he is a year older than Ronald Reagan was when he was sworn in. Trump named three of his children, all in their thirties, to his transition team, and the age of his children poses ethical questions that have largely been irrelevant for more than 20 years because of the relatively young presidents who have occupied the White House.\n\n(The Clintons came to Washington with 12-year-old Chelsea, Jenna and Barbara Bush were both college students during the beginning of their father's presidency, and Sasha and Malia Obama were 7 and 10 years old when they moved into the White House.) \n\nWe rarely hear the voices of the children living in the White House because they have been so young and because they have largely been considered off-limits to the press. \n\nPerhaps the most famous exception prior to Ivanka was Alice Roosevelt Longworth, President Theodore Roosevelt's first daughter, who was an endless source of fascination for the press. Alice smoked in public, wore pants and engaged in other \"unladylike\" behavior just after the turn of the 20th century.\n\n Dubbed \"Princess Alice,\" she did not shy away from controversy. Alice admitted rather coldly that she felt \"ecstatic\" when President William McKinley was assassinated and her father became the 26th president. It is hard to imagine the always composed Ivanka saying something so unguarded in public.  \"I just want to be a good daughter,\" Ivanka insists, even when it's clear she wants to do much more than that. \n\nAnd no presidential daughter has come to her father's defense quite like Ivanka has since Julie Nixon Eisenhower. Julie is the only daughter of a president who has been so publicly devoted. As the Watergate investigation dragged on, Julie stood by her father's side. In a diary entry less than a year before her father's resignation, Julie wrote: \"Fight, fight, fight.\" \n\nShe took the bold step of standing in her father's place during a news conference at the height of the scandal. \"I have seen what my father has gone through, and I am so proud of him that I would never be afraid to come out here. ... I am not trying to answer questions for him. I am just trying to pray for enough courage to meet his courage.\"\n\nJulie's praise for her father is not unlike what we've heard from Ivanka, who defended Trump from charges of misogyny and insisted: \"My father is a feminist. He's a big reason I am the woman I am today.\" That devotion is returned: During the campaign, when asked to name a woman he would consider appointing to his Cabinet, Trump mentioned Ivanka. \"She's very popular, she's done very well.\" \n\nIn a 1970 memo, top Nixon aide H.R. Haldeman described the need to find full-time jobs for Julie and her sister Tricia, then both in their early twenties. \"Income is not a factor -- the President will pay them himself.\" In the memo Haldeman acknowledged that Nixon's daughters could not \"work for the government, or for the Nixon Foundation.\" Even Nixon recognized the limits of his own power and the influence his daughters should have in his White House.\n\nThere are many lessons Trump could take from Richard Nixon's behavior about what not to do as president -- flouting nepotism in the Oval Office is only one among many.

That is true, but irrelevant. The key point... is that everyone will shout, 'Jeez, mate, there's a dead cat on the table!' In other words, they will be talking about the dead cat -- the thing you want them to talk about -- and they will not be talking about the issue that has been causing you so much grief.\"\n\nOver the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump unveiled a particularly malodorous dead cat. In the past week, he had agreed to settle the Trump University lawsuits for $25 million, with a potential additional $1 million in penalties forthcoming. The suits alleged Trump defrauded people who enrolled in real estate seminars he started in 2005.  \n\nMeanwhile, his new DC hotel was marketing its services to diplomats keen to please the new President. As one diplomat told The Washington Post: \"Why wouldn't I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new President, 'I love your new hotel!' Isn't it rude to come to his city and say, 'I am staying at your competitor?'\" The link between presidency and personal profit was laid bare for all to see. \n\nAfter all this, Trump's dead cat strike should have been predictable. On Friday night, Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended the Broadway musical \"Hamilton;\" by Saturday, Trump had taken to Twitter to denounce the musical's performers for being \"very rude\" to his future Vice President. \n\nIn fact, as video evidence shows, cast member Brandon Victor Dixon had read out a scrupulously polite statement of the inclusive values celebrated in the performance; it gave the impression of having been filtered through so many Broadway PR flacks as to be rendered entirely uncontentious. \n\nSome audience members seemed to boo either Pence or the performers -- it's hard to tell on video -- but Dixon insisted: \"There's nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen. There's nothing to boo. We're all here sharing a story of love.\" \n\nReframed by Trump on Twitter hours later, this became an act of harassment against Pence. By Sunday morning, the President-elect was on back on social media demanding an apology from the actors who, he said, had offended the Vice President-elect (Pence himself later indicated he was not offended). Trump has a history of reframing civic criticism as harassment. One is reminded of his vicious misrepresentation of President Obama's own approach to protestors. \n\nSadly, few controversies could have served Trump so well. Liberal Twitter may not like it, but Trump has won every battle he's picked in the ongoing culture wars. \"Hamilton,\" with its hit soundtrack and vision of an America founded by immigrants, has inspired people of color across the United States who may never see the stage show. Even a photograph of a black actor embodying George Washington has impact. \n\nBut it has nonetheless come to epitomize the elitism of a New York City subculture in which patrons can afford to spend upwards of $1,000 on secondary market tickets. While its celebration of racial diversity is received wisdom in NYC, (\"immigrants -- we get the job done!\" runs one of its most famous chants), perhaps it is more alien to some white voters in, say, Maricopa County, Arizona. \n\nAnd though theater lovers were quick to mock the Trumpistas who threatened to \"Boycott Hamilton\" (the play is sold out until August 2017), snarky promises to hoover up any unwanted tickets are unlikely to heal America's gaping social divides. \n\nIn the spirit of furthering this divide, both Trump supporters and opponents have suggested that Mike Pence could have expected nothing less than an evening of left-wing politics in choosing to attend \"Hamilton.\" It is a show about political protest, yes (\"I'd rather be divisive than indecisive,\" raps Hamilton.) Yet it is not quite so simple. \n\n\"Hamilton\" is ultimately all about meritocracy, a hip hop celebration of \"winner\" culture. Had Trump chosen to attend himself, he might have found it spoke to him. After all, his daughter Ivanka tweeted in March that she had finally seen the musical and loved it. Presumably she is not one of those who, as her father insisted in yet another tweet on Sunday morning, have let him know that \"Hamilton\" \"is highly overrated.\"\n\nIndeed, it was brave of Dixon and his colleagues to engage at all with a presidential team which has shown a consistent fear of open criticism. It is easy to mock New York actors for grandstanding; harder to accept that Trump's bullying now carries with it the threat of a future President's retaliation. \n\nPress reporters write of intimidation by supporters at his campaign rallies. The same spirit now threatens the theater. At a Chicago performance of \"Hamilton\" on Saturday night, a protester interrupted the performance to shout profanities in support of Trump: the producers are concerned that the next Trump fan in the audience will be violent. \n\nFreedom of expression is suddenly a hot-button American issue. The problem for those who oppose Trump is that by turning the attention of the Twittering classes to a spat with a theater, the President-elect has diverted attention away from his other egregious headlines.\n\nIn this climate, it is the responsibility of editors, reporters and Twitter to ensure that those headlines about such things as potential violations of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which states that no politician accept any kind of gift from a foreign dignitary, remain the top story. \n\nAs John Stuart Mill argued in \"On Liberty,\" freedom of expression is the freedom on which all other civic rights are based. Allow a US president to censor the language of actors by intimidation, and he'll soon be giving newspapers the same treatment. \n\nWe may prefer our newspapers to cover corruption allegations than to waste space defending a few mouthy actors. But if we don't defend the right of actors to criticize a president, the next generation of journalists will have a harder time campaigning against corruption themselves.\n\nDonald Trump has thrown a dead cat onto a table to divert attention from allegations of corruption. But when a dead cat is a threat to freedom of expression, we should still be shouting about it.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.3222591876983603, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1137, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.67526163083, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161122020000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 2.3746701846965697, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/world/immigration-ban-voicemails/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1294, "scraper_regex": 1388}}, "headline": "Listen to the voicemails of people impacted by the immigration ban", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1388, "date": "20170129200000", "story_content": "From Boston to Baghdad, families are being ripped apart.

It's rarely just one thing, and you'll often hear the term \"constellation of evidence\" to describe how a particular attacker is identified. It's analogous to traditional detective work. Investigators collect clues and piece them together with known mode of operations. They look for elements that resemble other attacks and elements that are anomalies. The clues might involve ones and zeros, but the techniques go back to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nThe University of Toronto-based organization Citizen Lab routinely attributes attacks against the computers of activists and dissidents to particular Third World governments. It took months to identify China as the source of the 2012 attacks against The New York Times. While it was uncontroversial to say that Russia was the source of a cyberattack against Estonia in 2007, no one knew if those attacks were authorized by the Russian government -- until the attackers explained themselves. And it was the Internet security company CrowdStrike, which first attributed the attacks against the Democratic National Committee to Russian intelligence agencies in June, based on multiple pieces of evidence gathered from its forensic investigation. \n\nAttribution is easier if you are monitoring broad swaths of the Internet. This gives the National Security Agency a singular advantage in the attribution game. The problem, of course, is that the NSA doesn't want to publish what it knows.\n\nRegardless of what the government knows and how it knows it, the decision of whether to make attribution evidence public is another matter. When Sony was attacked, many security experts -- myself included -- were skeptical of both the government's attribution claims and the flimsy evidence associated with it. I only became convinced when The New York Times ran a story about the government's attribution, which talked about both secret evidence inside the NSA and human intelligence assets inside North Korea. In contrast, when the Office of Personnel Management was breached in 2015, the US government decided not to accuse China publicly, either because it didn't want to escalate the political situation or because it didn't want to reveal any secret evidence.\n\nThe Obama administration has been more public about its evidence in the DNC case, but it has not been entirely public.\n\nIt's one thing for the government to know who attacked it. It's quite another for it to convince the public who attacked it. As attribution increasingly relies on secret evidence -- as it did with North Korea's attack of Sony in 2014 and almost certainly does regarding Russia and the previous election -- the government is going to have to face the choice of making previously secret evidence public and burning sources and methods, or keeping it secret and facing perfectly reasonable skepticism. \n\nIf the government is going to take public action against a cyberattack, it needs to make its evidence public. But releasing secret evidence might get people killed, and it would make any future confidentiality assurances we make to human sources completely non-credible. This problem isn't going away; secrecy helps the intelligence community, but it wounds our democracy.\n\nThe constellation of evidence attributing the attacks against the DNC, and subsequent release of information, is comprehensive. It's possible that there was more than one attack. It's possible that someone not associated with Russia leaked the information to WikiLeaks, although we have no idea where that someone else would have obtained the information. We know that the Russian actors who hacked the DNC -- both the FSB, Russia's principal security agency, and the GRU, Russia's military intelligence unit -- are also attacking other political networks around the world.\n\nIn the end, though, attribution comes down to whom you believe. When Citizen Lab writes a report outlining how a United Arab Emirates human rights defender was targeted with a cyberattack, we have no trouble believing that it was the UAE government. When Google identifies China as the source of attacks against Gmail users, we believe it just as easily. \n\nObama decided not to make the accusation public before the election so as not to be seen as influencing the election. Now, afterward, there are political implications in accepting that Russia hacked the DNC in an attempt to influence the US presidential election. But no amount of evidence can convince the inconvincible.\n\nThe most important thing we can do right now is deter any country from trying this sort of thing in the future, and the political nature of the issue makes that harder. Right now, we've told the world that others can get away with manipulating our election process as long as they can keep their efforts secret until after one side wins. Obama has promised both secret retaliations and public ones. We need to hope they're enough.

Roland Sch\u00f6nbauer, a spokesman for the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), told CNN Monday that the organization was transferring some 120 vulnerable men, women and children, including people still living in tents, to hotels following the storm. \n\nThe situation in Moria is fluid, and the spokesman did not have an estimate for the number of people still living in tents. Volunteers say thousands of refugees are still living in outdoor tents in the camp, despite statements by Greece's minister for migration, Yiannis Mouzalas, indicating otherwise.\n\n\"There are no refugees or migrants living in the cold anymore,\" Mouzalas told journalists at a news conference Thursday. According to local reports, Mouzalas suggested that there were only a handful of tents left in Vayiohori, near Thessaloniki, and Athens.  \n\nA Lesbos resident and volunteer, Philippa Kempson, shared video with CNN showing the shocking conditions at Moria camp, where some tents appeared to have collapsed underneath the weight of the snow.\n\n\"I'm amazed no one is dead yet,\" she said.

They said that this is the worst winter they have experience on Lesbos for 15 years.\n\nElla Carlquist, founder and chair of the humanitarian organization United Rescue Aid, also known as United Rescues, told CNN that she has seen a few cases of hypothermia at Moria camp, where many people don't have proper winter clothes.\n\n\"The weather has been bad for quite a long time now.

Amnesty International is campaigning for asylum seekers to be transferred from the Greek islands to the mainland.   \n\n\"Asylum-seekers on the Greek islands face overcrowding, freezing temperatures, lack of hot water, violence and hate-motivated attacks,\" Iverna McGowan, director of Amnesty International's European Institution's Office, said in a statement. \"While we have long called for reception conditions to improve, forcing refugees to stay on the islands only so that they can be returned to Turkey, in line with Turkey's interpretation of the deal, is inhumane.\"\n\nUN warns of temperature drop\n\nUNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards made a similar plea at a briefing Friday, one day before the arctic blast slammed Europe.\n\n\"The UN Refugee Agency is today reiterating its call to accelerate the moving of asylum seekers from the Aegean islands to the Greek mainland,\" Edwards said at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. \"The need for better protection will become all the more acute this weekend when temperatures on the islands are expected to drop. We are worried.\"\n\nAccording to UNHCR, as of January 4, only about 7,800 people have been relocated or scheduled to relocate under the EU Relocation Mechanism -- around 12% of the 66,400 places agreed last year.\n\nTransfers of asylum seekers to the mainland are only allowed after people have completed the registration process, which has been delayed by a number of factors, including a shortage of spaces on the mainland. \n\n\"It's completely inhumane. People are getting stuck here for a year. How do you expect people to survive?\" Carlquist said. \"What we have here is not even a refugee situation anymore... it is thousands of homeless people with no future.\"\n\nUNHCR hailed a \u20ac25 million contribution from the EU aid department, known as Echo, in a video shared to Facebook in late November. In the footage, Liene Veide, a UNHCR spokeswoman, highlighted how a portion of these funds were being used to help refugees prepare for winter. Since April, Echo has given UNHCR \u20ac14 million in funds specifically for winterization measures, which include things like improvements to shelter infrastructure, new residential containers, thermal blankets and winter jackets.\n\nAspasia Kakari, a communications manager at M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF or Doctors Without Borders), told CNN that, given these funds, the dire conditions at camps like Moria were completely avoidable.\n\n\"If it gets any worse, we will start to see completely preventable deaths,\" Kakari said.\n\nAsylum seekers across Europe face deadly cold\n\nRefugees elsewhere in Europe are not faring much better amid plummeting temperatures.\n\nGerman federal police said that they discovered 19 asylum seekers -- including five children -- suffering from hypothermia after they were abandoned at a highway stop in Bavaria in -4\u00b0F (-20\u00b0C) weather on Sunday. Their driver had abandoned the truck, leaving the group in an unheated cargo area for hours.\n\nIn Bulgaria, border police said two men from Iraq and a Somali woman were found in the mountains near Turkey last week, having died from cold.\n\nA 20-year-old Afghan man died from complications on January 3 after crossing the Evros River at night in below freezing temperatures, according to UNHCR.\n\nAs many as 2,000 asylum seekers sheltering in an abandoned warehouse in Belgrade are facing extreme cold temperatures. Aid workers in the Serbian capital say that the refugees are lighting fires in the warehouse in order to keep warm, and many have fallen ill.\n\n\"It's amazing how people are still surviving in these conditions,\" Todor Gardos, an Amnesty International researcher told CNN.

Worse still, many pilots with symptoms of depression may not seek treatment due to fears of negative career consequences, such as being grounded, said researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nNearly 1,850 pilots participated in the anonymous, web-based survey conducted between April and December 2015 and led by Joseph Allen, senior author and an assistant professor of exposure assessment science at Harvard Chan School.\n\nThe new study comes just a year and a half after a depressed Germanwings co-pilot killed 150 people when he deliberately crashed a plane into the French Alps.\n\nHigh prevalence\n\nAllen and his colleagues designed the survey with a mix of topics so as not to \"tip their hand\" and reveal the study's focus on mental health. This was done to avoid participants' preconceptions as much as possible. Pulling standardized questions from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the research team also included queries typically used by doctors to diagnose depression. \n\nAfter weighing the pros and cons, the team chose to conduct their survey anonymously.\n\n\"The advantages of having an anonymous survey would be more important for us because we wanted obviously participation but we wanted the pilots to absolutely feel like their answers were confidential and it wouldn't be able to be traced back to them in any way so that they could honestly report,\" said Alexander Wu, first author and a doctoral student at Harvard Chan School. \n\nAnalyzing the data, Allen, Wu and their colleagues discovered a considerable number of pilots suffering symptoms of depression. \n\nOut of nearly 3,500 participants, 1,848 completed the questions about mental health.  Within this group, 233 pilots -- or 12.6% -- met the criteria for likely depression. Of 1,430 pilots who said they'd worked within the past seven days, 193 -- or 13.5% -- met the criteria for depression. \n\nBy comparison, 7% of people in the United States experienced depression in the past year, noted the authors.\n\nOverall, 75 pilots (4.1%) reported having suicidal thoughts within the previous two weeks.\n\nDepression was more likely among pilots who were victims of sexual harassment (36.4% among those experiencing harassment four or more times in the past week) or verbal harassment (42.9% among those experiencing harassment four or more times in the past week), the researchers learned. Pilots who used higher levels of sleep aid medication also were more likely to be depressed.\n\nPilot evaluation\n\nDr. Andrew F. Leuchter, a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA Brain Research Institute, observed that thoughts of suicide are common among depressed people. \"We always are concerned about when patients tell us that they are thinking about suicide,\" he told CNN in an email. \"Fortunately, most patients do not act on these thoughts.\"\n\nSimilarly, the Air Line Pilots Association urged caution when interpreting the survey results.\n\n\"It is important to remember that airline travel is the safest mode of transportation in the world,\" the association wrote in an email.  The association noted that pilots for US carriers safely accomplish 27,000 takeoffs and landings each day and in all kinds of conditions.\n\nUntil now, most information about mental health and pilots has been based on incident investigations and reports and health assessments that are protected by airlines and aviation authorities. The survey was intended to provide a \"more accurate description of mental health\" among pilots, yet Allen noted that he and his colleagues did not have access to medical records and did not conduct interviews to confirm diagnosis of depression. \n\nAccording to Leuchter, who was not affiliated with the new research, \"the rates of depression among pilots in this study are comparable to (or in some cases lower than) those seen in many population surveys.\" \n\nHe also found the lack of in-person interviews to be a significant flaw of the study along with the fact \"that we do not know whether those who chose to respond are representative of pilots in general.\" Yet, Leuchter said a major strength is that the study \"is based upon a large sample of pilots, so it provide more information than previous studies.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration requires aeromedical examiners to evaluate the fitness of pilots, explained Allen and his co-authors. Examiners, though, do not diagnose mental health conditions, and the only way a mental disorder is even noted in a pilot's health records is if he or she mentions it.\n\nThe profession is among the \"most highly vetted careers today\" in North America, the Air Line Pilots Association responded. The association noted that pilots \"are continuously evaluated throughout their careers\" through medical exams, training and other programs as well as \"during random flight checks by the Federal Aviation Administration.\" \n\n\"Flight and cabin crewmembers also monitor and evaluate each other while on duty, and procedures, processes, and programs exist to respond should a concern arise,\" added the association.\n\nYet the authors of the study believe that \"underreporting of mental health symptoms and diagnoses is probable among airline pilots due to the public stigma of mental illness and fear among pilots of being \"grounded\" or not fit for duty.\"\n\nPrevalence of depressive symptoms among high-stress occupations include 7% among emergency medical technicians, 10 to 17% among police officers, and 12% among deployed and 13% among previously deployed military personnel, the researchers estimate.  \n\nIn future studies, the researchers hope to examine the risk factors for depression among pilots. \n\n\"We suspect that disrupted circadian rhythm and/or sleep disturbances may be associated with having a higher depressive score,\" said Wu.\n\nThe fatal Germanwings incident was not an isolated event, suggested a team of Irish researchers in a study published this year. They report \"inconclusive evidence\" to suggest the 1999 crash of an EgyptAir Boeing 767 that killed 217 individuals after taking off from New York might have been deliberately caused by the relief first officer. Similarly, an incident report from Silk Air Flight 185, which crashed en route to Singapore in 1997, killing 104, indicated that the captain was suffering from \"multi-work related difficulties.\"\n\nDespite effective treatments, fewer than half of people with depression receive treatment, says the World Health Organization. One of the major barriers for seeking care is social stigma, yet pilots have the added burden of long and continuous work hours, which make scheduling treatment difficult, noted the authors.\n\nIn June, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that it will require medical examiners who screen commercial pilots to undergo more training to help them better identify warning signs of mental illnesses. Still, though, commercial pilots will not need to undergo psychological testing.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.4897956848144505, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 899, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.77680184415, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.89098998887653, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/21/opinions/america-invest-again-in-education-levy/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "America is falling far behind on educating its kids", "wordcount_as_scraped": 882, "date": "20161221220000", "story_content": "Education has long been the fuel that powered the mighty engine of our nation's economy. As the number of Americans with high school and college degrees soared right after World War II, our middle class grew dramatically and the United States reached new heights of job creation, productivity and prosperity, becoming the envy of the world. \n\nBut today American students are falling far behind those in other nations. Why? Our schools are failing to prepare graduates for our increasingly competitive global economy. Improving our nation's education system will be a major bipartisan challenge for the incoming Trump administration, as well as for Congress, the states and, most importantly, individual school districts. \n\nOne discouraging sign about the preparedness of our young people to compete came in early December, with the release of 2015 test scores for the Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, an exam given every three years to compare the performance of 15-year-olds around the world in math, science and reading. \n\nAmerican students dropped from 28th place in math in 2012 to 35th place in 2015, among the 60 nations where students took the PISA test in both years. In 2015, among all 73 nations and economies where the test was administered to 540,000 students, American students dropped to 40th place in math, and placed 25th in science and 24th in reading.\n\nOne reason for these statistics is that governments at every level in the United States have underfunded our system of elementary and secondary schools, as well as public colleges and universities.\n\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities recently issued a disturbing study that concluded that 35 states provided less overall state funding per student in public schools from kindergarten through 12th grade in 2014 (after adjusting for inflation) than they did in 2008, before the start of the Great Recession. In 27 states, local funding per student fell at the same time, compounding the damage of the state aid cuts.\n\nThese cuts do great harm to students by forcing schools to increase class sizes, keep teacher pay low, reduce the number of electives offered, cut back on purchases of education technology and fail to maintain the school buildings.  \n\nIn addition, cash-strapped public high schools assign far too many students to each counselor, making it almost impossible for them to give students individual advice on course selection or applying for college. While the American School Counselor Association recommends that each high school counselor advise no more than 250 students, the association reports that counselors across the nation advise an average of 491. Counselors in California advise 822 and those in Arizona advise an astounding 941. Low-income students suffer the most because they have no one else to whom they can turn.  \n\nAnother report by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities issued in August found that 46 states spent an average of 18% less per student on public higher education in the 2015-16 school year than they did before the recession of 2008. \n\nThe report said: \"Years of cuts in state funding for public colleges and universities have driven up tuition and harmed students' educational experiences by forcing faculty reductions, fewer course offerings, and campus closings. These choices have made college less affordable and less accessible for students who need degrees to succeed in today's economy.\"\n\nIn short, after years of academic progress in America, we find ourselves in danger of heading in the wrong direction.\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, the percentage of Americans age 25 and older with high school diplomas rose from just 25% in 1940 to 88% in 2015. The percentage with bachelor's degrees went from only 5% in 1940 to 33% in 2015. If we want to continue having a competitive workforce, these numbers must keep going up.\n\nBut now other nations are catching up and passing us by, producing a greater percentage of people with high school and post-high school degrees.\n\n For example, in 2014 the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  reported that only Estonia had a higher percentage of high school graduates than the United States among people age 55 to 64, who had completed their education decades earlier. But among people age 25 to 34, who had been in school more recently, 11 nations had a higher percentage of high school graduates than the United States, and -- no surprise -- those are the nations with thriving economies. \n\n \n\nThe same pattern has held for people obtaining degrees beyond high school. The report found that for people ages 55 to 64, only Israel and Canada had a higher percentage than the United States with post-high school degrees. But for people 25 to 34, 10 nations surpassed us in the percentage of college graduates.\n\n Allowing this alarming trend to continue by starving public schools, colleges and universities of the money they need to offer the world-class education our children and young adults require will have dire long-term consequences. \n\nThese include a weakened economy, higher unemployment, and, most importantly, a lower American standard of living and reduced national security. This nightmare scenario won't materialize next month or next year, but it awaits us in the years ahead if our leaders fail to act soon to reverse the education funding cuts of recent years.\n\n We have a responsibility to do more for our children.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.5690376758575402, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 876, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.80701966051, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.42465753424658, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/health/school-survey-post-election-negative-incidents/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00ed": [5749, 6027]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1275, "scraper_regex": 1640}}, "headline": "Harassment in schools skyrockets after election, teachers report", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1640, "date": "20161129150000", "story_content": "In the days following Donald Trump's presidential victory, students in Kansas chanted, \"Trump won, you're going back to Mexico,\" to students from other countries, according to a high school teacher in a suburban community within the state.\n\nIn Oregon, a high school teacher photographed vandalism in the boys' bathroom, which mentioned the KKK and used the n-word.\n\nIn Tennessee, a black student was blocked from entering his classroom by two white students chanting, \"Trump, Trump,\" according to a high school teacher at the school where this happened.\n\nAnd, in Georgia, a 12-year-old white male student saw an \"X\" on another white student's paper and proceeded to draw a swastika on his paper, according to a middle school teacher at the school. \"And our administration is telling us not to talk about it,\" the teacher said. \n\nThose are just a few of the examples given by more than 10,000 educators, 90% of whom are teachers, who responded to an online survey sponsored by Teaching Tolerance, a project of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is dedicated to reducing prejudice and improving relations among school children across the country. The organization has been critical of Donald Trump following comments from the candidate it characterized as fueling racism and bigotry. The educators were asked to answer a series of questions about the climate at their schools following the presidential election.\n\nIn the first national snapshot of what teachers are observing, nine out of 10 educators who responded to the survey said the election has negatively impacted students' behavior and mood. Forty percent said they have heard derogatory language used against students of color, Muslims, immigrants and other students based on gender or sexual orientation.\n\n\"We are still daily experiencing the affects of the outcome,\" said Lindsey Polkl, a fifth-grade teacher in Minnesota. \"My students have begun playing a game called 'Trump's Coming,' in which one non-Hispanic student yells 'Trump's Coming' and all of the Hispanic students need to hide.\"  \n\n\"There have been more fights between students as well as students toward teachers, a direct result of the anxiety our students are constantly feeling,\" Polkl said. \"Daily we discuss and answer questions about the hate they see spewed across the internet and within their community, about what is true and what is not true.\"\n\nIn all, there were more than 2,500 reports of \"negative incidents\" of bigotry and harassment that can be directly tied to the rhetoric of the presidential campaign, according to the report, entitled \"After Election Day: The Trump Effect.\" These incidents include posting graffiti such as swastikas and comments by students saying something along the lines of, \"Better pack your bags. You're going to be deported,\" said Maureen Costello, director of Teaching Tolerance.\n\nThis new survey is not scientific and does not represent a random sampling of teachers across the country. It was disseminated to teachers, staff and other educators by Teaching Tolerance through a link on its website and across social media, and was also shared by other education groups. \n\nIt stands to reason that teachers and educators who are witnessing problems were the ones more likely to respond. Still, the survey results do paint a picture of the anxiety that is being felt in some classrooms around the country.\n\n\"If I had to say, looking at the results, does it skew in some way, I would say that it skews toward people who teach some of the large numbers of immigrants, vulnerable students,\" said Costello. \"Those are the people we really heard from because I think those are the schools that are most affected and clearly people who didn't think there was any problem going on probably didn't feel as compelled to answer the survey.\"\n\nHateful harrassment up, say advocates\n\nNationwide, there have been more than 867 incidents of \"hateful harassment\" in the first days following the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center says. In a press conference Tuesday, Richard Cohen, the center's president, said he fears those incidents are under reported. \n\n\"These incidents of hate occurred in schools, on public streets and parks and in retail establishments. People were even targeted in their homes,\" said Cohen. \"These incidents have been ugly. And time after time the perpetrator has invoked Mr. Trump's name. The level of hate that has been unleashed is unprecedented.\"\n\n\"Our report also documented about 20 incidents against Trump supporters,\" added Cohen. \"And we would repudiate those acts as well.\"\n\nIn the \"After Election Day\" report, a \"very small minority\" of teachers said the election has not affected their schools. Most of the teachers who felt that way came from schools that were predominantly white, with few students of color or immigrants.\n\n\"Truly it hasn't had an impact,\" wrote a middle school teacher in Utah. \"Because I talk about these things in class, I have been able to see what little impact there is. Colleagues haven't seen anything.\"\n\nBut 80% of the educators who responded said they have observed a heightened anxiety on the part of some students, namely immigrants, Muslims, African Americans and LGBT students. In some cases, the anxiety lead to thoughts of suicide. \n\n\"In a 24-hour period, I completed two suicide assessments and two threat of violence assessments for middle school students,\" a Florida middle school counselor reported in the survey. \"This was one week after the election... students were threatening violence against African Americans. Students were suicidal and without hope. Fights, disrespect have increased as well.\"\n\nIn Tuesday's press conference, Janet Murgu\u00eda, president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, a Latino advocacy group with community ties throughout the country, said a call with their affiliates backed up the Teaching Tolerance survey. \n\n\"What were they seeing in those first days after the election?\" asked Murgu\u00eda. \"They told us of countless incidents of harassment, verbal and physical taunts and most importantly, many students contemplating taking their own lives. Everything the teachers reported is collaborated by what we are hearing from our affiliates.\"\n\nHeightened anxiety for minority students\n\n\"The takeaway message is first of all that school administrators and school board members and anyone who has to do with education has a crisis on their hands,\" said Costello. \"If you're talking about at least a quarter of students -- and it's estimated that a quarter of students in American schools are immigrants, or the children of immigrants -- suffering trauma, that is going to have quite the impact over the course of the year.\n\nShe added that \"there's certainly been a breakdown in school culture and I think many schools are now ripe for incidents.\" \n\nOne of the teachers who responded to the survey, who didn't want to share her name publicly or the name of her school for fear of retaliation, told CNN that incidents of harassment and vandalism were left unpunished at her school.\n\n\"There was no investigation as it was determined it would be impossible to know who committed these acts,\" she said via email. \"Many incidences are unreported or under reported, as there is a fear of retaliation. This is an area of the country where most adults voted for, and avidly support, Trump.\"\n\nAnother teacher who responded to the survey, a high school teacher in Kansas who reported that students were chanting to the English language learners that they would be sent back to Mexico, believes the total number of negative incidents across the country is probably much larger than has been publicly reported so far. She says teachers are not able to report incidents directly to the press meaning many of them are never revealed to the public.\n\n\"We're supposed to keep everything in house,\" said the teacher who also didn't want to use to use her name, saying school policy forbids her from independently talking to the press. \"That's pretty standard for most districts and most schools. If there's a problem, you take care of it internally but you don't go out to the press with it.\"\n\nHostility caught 'a lot of people unaware'\n\nSchools were not prepared for what unfolded following Trump's unexpected defeat of Hillary Clinton, some teachers said.\n\n\"I don't think that they anticipated in any way what kids were going to say because for the most part, our schools are very diverse,\" said the teacher in Kansas. \"It's not something we deal with anymore. It's not like the '50s, so this reactionary stuff going on just caught a lot of people by surprise.\"\n\nWhile two-thirds of respondents to the survey said that administrations have been \"responsive\" to what's been going on at their school, four out of 10 said they didn't think their school had a real plan of action to deal with incidents of bias and hate.\n\nThe Kansas high school teacher said her school, and others, could use better resources, including more training for teachers, administrators and staff.\n\n\"I think a lot of people thought we were in the post-racial era and they didn't expect this going backwards kind of behavior,\" she said. \"This kind of hostility just really caught a lot of people unaware.\"\n\nAs for what caused the hostility, she believes it's what students saw on TV during the presidential campaign and what they're hearing at home. \"I think it's the dark underbelly of this country. It wasn't socially acceptable to be like this for a long time.\"\n\nSince the incidents in the days following the election, however, things at her school have really calmed down. \"A week and a half ago, it was like, 'Oh my God,' \" but since then, the school has gotten proactive, she said.\n\n\"Teachers are out in the hall, (the) administration's out in the hall, security's out in the hall,\" she said. \"Our kids know that if anything happens to anybody, we will act upon it. We will pull security footage if we have to but everybody here needs to be safe.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.1586503982543905, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1275, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.31416764752, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161129150000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 3, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.80392156862745, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/16/opinions/controversial-capitol-painting-rodney-opinion/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [565]}}, "headline": "How controversial Capitol painting can show us who we are ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 965, "date": "20170116160000", "story_content": "Why is a painting by a high school student the object of a tug-of-war between rival factions of the 115th Congress? The painting ended up in this fracas after it won Democratic Representative William Clay's congressional art competition last May. \n\nIn my considered opinion, the painting, \"Untitled #1\" by high school student David Pulphus, isn't very good. Its figuration is amateurish; the content doesn't just veer towards, but fully embraces the sentimental, and its symbolic content is relatively clich\u00e9. It shows a protest march. There is a figure, in the foreground wearing a graduation cap nailed into a crucifix that doubles as what might be the scales of justice with the modern, oppositional yin and yang symbols held in balance. Various hand-made signs are held by civilians, including one that claims \"racism kills.\" Yet perhaps most controversially, there's a police officer depicted with a boar's head, aiming his weapon at someone who might be a protester.\n\nApparently because of this anti-police sentiment, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, has found it necessary to denounce the work on the Mike Gallagher radio show, saying, \"It's disgusting and it's not befitting the Capitol.\" \n\nThere are several things wrong with the Republican response to this controversy. \n\nIt only makes logical sense to have a curator (who deals in visual art) judge this issue. If the Republicans are going to stack the deck, they should at least do so in ways that are believable. More importantly, why do they care? Is their worldview so fragile that seeing cops depicted as pigs (or boars) threatens it? Is the image so offensive to them they feel that it must be expunged from their field of vision, lest they succumb to its argument? \n\nCNN has reported that Clay stipulates that House members cannot select the artists, do not sign off on the artistic concepts and have no role in judging the competition, so we should not view this as an act of petty provocation. Despite Clay's affirmation that the painting has been hanging inside the Capitol, along with over 400 other winners, since the summer (so this is not news), Mr. Clay, a Missouri Democrat, has had to rehang the painting at least three separate times this month after House Republicans had it taken down and put it back in Clay's office. \n\nThe argument that Speaker Ryan and other Republicans have made is one pertaining to rules. Ryan reportedly said, \"It's not about the First Amendment, it's about the rules of the Capitol. The art competition rules do not allow for this type of painting.\" Representative Dave Reichert from Washington led the GOP efforts to have the painting taken down. Reichert -- who has said the painting will be taken down permanently \u2014  sent a letter to the architect of the Capitol requesting him to review whether the painting conforms with the contest rules, which bar \"exhibits depicting subjects of contemporary political controversy or a sensationalistic and gruesome nature.\" Clay, however, argues that it is a matter of First Amendment free speech rights, and has diligently fought the GOP member's attempts to remove it from the Cannon tunnel. \n\nAs problematic as the GOP response to this painting is, their response is no surprise to me. It has been my experience growing up in the US that the Republican party has consistently been the party of those (white, heterosexual, Christians) who insist that every image they encounter corroborate their view of reality or be erased. They relentlessly attack art and cultural works when they don't conform to their picture of the world. But they don't just want to remove them from sight; they want to invalidate them, and by extension invalidate all other perspectives not their own. \n\nThis concerted effort at erasure begat multiculturalism as a philosophical alternative to the assimilation strategy of the melting pot; it begat identity politics and the culture wars, which at their core were all struggles to recognize people of color, people who have a range of sexual orientations and those who are agnostic, atheist, Muslim, Buddhist, or other, as just as crucial to the American story as anyone else, and therefore deserving of representation on their terms in all the nation's social, political and cultural institutions. \n\nHere's the awful truth: Police officers have acted on instinct rather than careful consideration in a way that many view as beastly. That's how you end up killing Tamir Rice, a twelve-year-old boy with a toy gun, or  John Crawford, an adult man also holding a toy gun, or another black man, Oscar Grant, who was shot to death with his hands already cuffed behind his back. The list of black men murdered by police is familiar to us. It begs the question: \"If you cannot rationally distinguish between friend and foe, then why are you entrusted to protect and serve?\" There are rules of police conduct that are violated every day that result in the callous murder of black men, and yet Paul Ryan and the rest of the Republican guard are instead offended by a painting that gestures toward that truth. \n\nThough the painting is not great art, the student's picture makes a crucial statement, which is what art should do. It has historically been within the purview of art to show ourselves to ourselves, to reveal who we are and what our priorities, ways of seeing and ethics are \u2014 the best and worst or ourselves.\n\nThe Speaker of the House is correct in saying that the painting is disgusting. It is, in that it reveals disgusting behavior, which police have perpetrated repeatedly, with no conscientious objection from him. Instead he and his Republican Congress spend time denouncing a painting and having it removed from their sight, not because they are principled, but precisely because they are not.

The resolution supports a peace process with Turkey and Russia serving as guarantors. \n\nRussia's Ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, said Saturday the resolution \"speaks to the need for compliance with a cessation of hostilities ... in Syria and of a very important meeting in the capital of Astana... where delegations of the opposition and the government will for the first time meet face to face.\" \n\nThe meeting backed by the UN in Geneva and outlined in the newly approved resolution is scheduled for February 8, 2017. \n\nUS Ambassador to the UN, Michelle Sison, lauded the agreement but asked for more transparency, saying, \"We are still learning more about this initiative, including details regarding its implementation.\"\n\n\"In this regard, we regret that the annexes to the agreements, which outline the ceasefire arrangement brokered by Russia and Turkey in detail, have not yet been made available,\" said Sison.\n\nThe latest effort comes after previous ceasefire attempts by the international community crumbled. \n\nA successful nationwide ceasefire hinges on many fighting factions laying down arms. Groups from Iraq, Iran and Lebanon also are fighting alongside the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \n\nTurkey and Russia previously said the ceasefire deal excludes groups considered \"terrorist organizations\" by the UN Security Council, ruling out ISIS and Jabhat Fateh Al-Sham.\n\nBut alliances between different rebel groups make matters complicated.

There was nothing about repealing Obamacare. But President-elect Donald Trump has plenty to do in his first 100 days in office.\n\nIn a video address on Monday, Trump outlined his priorities in his quest to \"put America first.\" Trump's list focused on steps he could take with executive actions, avoiding the need to go through the US Congress.\n\nHere's a breakdown of his plan.\n\nWithdraw from TPP\n\nTrump says he intends to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and replace it with \"fair bilateral trade deals.\"\n\nThe move will shatter President Barack Obama's aim of strengthening US influence in Asia and could leave the Western world's trade agenda in disarray. The TPP, which was aimed at linking the US economy with 11 countries around the Pacific, took years to negotiate.\n\n\"The TPP without the United States is meaningless,\" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday during a visit to Argentina.\n\nSome experts claimed that the TPP would kill jobs and worsen income inequality across the 12 nations, particularly in the US. Both Trump and Hillary Clinton spoke out against the 12-nation would-be bloc, which is responsible for 40% of world trade.\n\nDuring a campaign speech in Ohio in June, Trump said the TPP was \"another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country -- just a continuing rape of our country.\"\n\nCancel environmental restrictions\n\nThroughout his campaign, Trump was consistent in his promise to reduce environmental restrictions. Now he is vowing to deliver on that. \n\nIn his video, Trump says he will \"cancel job-killing restrictions on the production of American energy, including shale energy and clean coal\" and create \"many millions of high-paying jobs.\"\n\nThough he doesn't specifically mention it by name in Monday's video, one of Trump's primary targets has been Obama's Clean Power Plan, which many critics see as a \"war on coal.\"\n\nThe plan, which Trump has previously said he would scrap, targets existing coal-fired and natural gas power plants in an effort to reduce greenhouse emissions in the US by as much as 32% by 2030. It is expected to go before the Supreme Court in early 2017.\n\nREAD: Why climate change experts fear Trump's presidency\n\nTrump has previously claimed that climate change is a \"hoax\" led by the Chinese, though he later claimed he was joking in those remarks. He has also promised to \"cancel\" the historic Paris Agreement struck last year. \n\nCut regulation on businesses\n\nTrump says he will formulate a \"rule that says for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.\"\n\nHe has previously spoken of his desire to ax the Dodd-Frank Act, which was created after the financial crisis to abide by a litany of new rules to prevent another crash.\n\nDodd-Frank authorized the Fed to require Wall Street banks to hold more cash on hand than they previously had to. That has pinched banks' profits margins in recent years. Legal costs have also markedly increased for big banks since Dodd-Frank became law.\n\nThe Fed also does annual \"stress tests\" to simulate whether the bank was strong enough financially to withstand another financial crisis.\n\nAll that regulation has triggered huge backlash from Wall Street and Republicans, including Trump, though he has also supported stricter regulations in the past. \n\nIn May, Trump told Reuters his regulation policy would be \"close to dismantling Dodd-Frank.\"\n\nREAD: Trump opposed Wall Street regulations in past interviews\n\nGuard against cyberattacks\n\nTrump says he will establish a cyber-review team made up of members of the military, law enforcement and private sector.\n\nHe wants to audit the security of the federal government's computer systems and strengthen the hacking division of the US military.\n\nTrump also wants to \"develop the offensive cyber capabilities we need to deter attacks by both state and non-state actors and, if necessary, to respond appropriately.\"\n\nREAD: Here's Trump's plan to stop hackers\n\nThe US government is credited with having some of the most dangerous hacking tools on the planet. \n\nYet these weapons haven't deterred Russia from hacking into the Democratic National Committee, or China from hacking into American companies, or Iran from hacking into an American casino.\n\nExamine visa programs\n\nDuring the final weeks of his campaign, Trump outlined big plans for his first week in office when it came to immigration. \n\nTrump told his supporters that his plan \"ends illegal immigration and suspends immigration from terror problem regions.\" He also said he would \"stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens.\"\n\nIn his latest video speech, Trump says he will \"investigate all abuses of visa programs that undercut the American worker.\" However, he didn't mention the stand-out campaign promise to build a wall along the US border with Mexico.\n\nIn October, Trump said he would call for a two-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for those who illegally re-enter the US. He also suggested a five-year minimum sentence for those with prior felony convictions, multiple misdemeanors or two or more previous deportations.\n\nREAD: Trump makes 'closing argument,' again attacks accusers\n\nAt the moment there is no mandatory minimum, but undocumented immigrants who seek to re-enter the US can face up to two years in prison. Those with felonies face up to 10 years behind bars.\n\nEnact lobbying bans\n\nTrump promised to \"drain the swamp,\" so it's little surprise he has focused his ire on lobbyists.\n\nThe move will prohibit officials from becoming a lobbyists for five years after leaving government.\n\n\"Why that is crucial is that it goes back to Mr. Trump's goal of making sure that people aren't using the government to enrich themselves and using their service in government to do that,\" Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer said last week.\n\nREAD: Trump makes lobbying pledge\n\nDuring his interview on \"60 minutes,\" Trump conceded that his transition team was littered with DC insiders.\n\n\"Everybody's a lobbyist down there,\" he said.\n\n\"That's the problem with the system -- the system,\" Trump said. \"We're doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially.

People who are more optimistic than pessimistic tend to live longer, have better cardiovascular health, get a higher quality of sleep and have improved immune systems, studies suggest.\n\nThere are some research-based daily practices that might help you become more optimistic, said Nancy Sin, a postdoctoral fellow at Pennsylvania State University's Center for Healthy Aging and Department of Biobehavioral Health.\n\n\"I think that it probably is achievable if you have concrete ways of trying to increase optimism,\" Sin said. \"There are exercises that people can do to try to practice optimistic thinking, but in terms of how long-lasting these exercises are or whether they might result in improvements in health, I think the jury is still out.\"\n\nJust imagine, for only five minutes a day\n\nAn exercise in which you imagine your best possible self, living your best possible life, may improve levels of optimism, suggests a small study published in the Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry in 2011.\n\n \n\nThe Netherlands-based study involved 54 native Dutch-speaking adults, 18 to 43, who were divided into two groups. \n\nOne group was asked to think of and write down all best possible scenarios for their life in terms of personal, relational and professional domains. The other thought about and wrote down the activities that had taken place in their lives during the past 24 hours. \n\nAll participants were asked to put their thoughts into a detailed and coherent story.\n\nThen, in both groups, participants were instructed to imagine these stories playing out in a five-minute imagery exercise. The participants repeated these exercises once a day at home, for about five minutes, over a two-week period.\n\nAll participants also completed questionnaires intended to gauge their levels of optimism before the experiment, one week into the experiment and then after the two-week period.\n\nThe researchers found that the daily exercise of imagining your best possible self for two weeks resulted in increases in optimism, according to the questionnaires, after one week and the two-week period.\n\n\"There's this range of things we can do\" to improve optimism, said Eric Kim, a research fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He was not involved in the study.\n\n\"There are these paper and pencil exercises that show small effects on optimism, and another one is actually writing things that you're grateful for,\" he said. \"In randomized studies, if you do that for seven days, that's been shown to increase optimism a little bit.\"\n\nCan keeping a journal boost optimism?\n\nWriting in a journal about what you are grateful for was linked to greater feelings of optimism in a 2003 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.\n\n \n\nOne experiment in the study involved 192 undergraduate students who were divided into three groups. Each group wrote 10 weekly reports. \n\nOne group wrote about what they were grateful for over the past week, another group wrote about five hassles that occurred in the week, and the third group wrote about events or circumstances that affected them in the past week.\n\nIn addition to their weekly reports, the participants were asked to rate their overall mood, physical health, reactions to social support received, time spent exercising, life satisfaction and expectations for the upcoming week.\n\nParticipants in the gratitude group reported higher satisfaction with their lives as a whole and were more optimistic about the upcoming week than participants in the other two groups, the researchers found.\n\nA separate study showed that keeping a journal in which you write down your own acts of kindness is linked to increased optimism, Kim said. The study was published in the Journal of Happiness Studies in 2006.\n\nOne experiment in the study involved 119 female undergraduate students. They were asked to keep a daily journal and track any acts of kindness they performed for one week.\n\nThe students also completed a questionnaire in which they rated their personal feelings of happiness one month before and after the weeklong journaling.\n\nThe researchers found that the students' subjective happiness seemed to increase after the one-week experiment.\n\n'About 25% of optimism is heritable'\n\nAlthough certain practices may shift your thinking patterns to be more optimistic, they won't completely transform who you are overnight, Kim said.\n\n\"The thing I'm uncomfortable with seeing is that people think we can just completely change our levels of optimism just out of our sheer will and practice, but there's this really strong environmental factor that also impacts us,\" Kim said.\n\n\"People might be optimistic for a variety of reasons. For example, twin studies show that about 25% of optimism is heritable, which does mean that some of it can be controlled by thinking patterns and things that we do by ourselves, but also a lot of it might be due to social and structural factors,\" he said. \n\nFor instance, how much warmth and attention your parents gave you during childhood have been associated with levels of optimism later in life, Kim said.\n\nSocioeconomic status is also linked to optimism, with a lower status associated with viewing the future more negatively, according to a 2009 study published in the International Journal of Behavioral Medicine.\n\n\"So, even when we look within sociodemographic groups, like different levels of wealth or different levels of education, we see that there is a larger range of optimism within there,\" he said.\n\nWhether it comes naturally or not, a healthy degree of optimism still can be beneficial, Sin said.\n\n\"For the new year, I know a lot of people tend to set health goals, and I think that's where optimism can be really important, because if you are more optimistic or if you just generally feel that you can achieve these goals, then you might be more likely to be successful,\" Sin said. \n\n\"Part of the way that optimism operates is that it motivates people to tap into their social networks, and it helps people to figure out how to cope with setbacks and challenges,\" she said.

Tom Price, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, was pressed repeatedly by lawmakers to clarify his views on overhauling Obamacare -- a top priority for both the president and the GOP under the new administration.\n\nIn one particularly heated exchange with Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, Price was asked whether turning Medicaid into a block grant program would mean fewer people would be eligible in the future. The decades-old entitlement program extends health coverage to low-income Americans, and Menendez noted that as an entitlement program, anyone who meets the criteria currently has the right to be covered. \n\n\"When you move to a block grant, do you still have the right?\" Menendez asked. \n\n\"No, I think it would be determined by how that was set up,\" Price said. \n\nPrice's apparent acknowledgement that some low-income Americans may not be covered if Republicans move Medicaid over to a block grant system would mark a radical shift in the purpose that the program is supposed to serve. \n\nDuring the campaign, Trump initially said he wouldn't cut Medicaid, but later expressed support for the block grant formula. But still, even as he publicly backed reforming the program, Trump has been adamant that the government's has a duty to help the poor.  \n\n\"You cannot let people die on the street, OK?\" Trump said at a CNN town hall last year. \"The problem is that everybody thinks that you people, as Republicans, hate the concept of taking care of people that are really, really sick and are gonna die. We gotta take care of people that can't take care of themselves.\" \n\nTuesday, Price acknowledged Medicaid is vital but insisted it was troubled. The federal government should leave it to governors and state insurance commissioners to decide how best to cover their low-income residents, Price noted, and that he wants any Obamacare replacement bill to provide coverage options for every American. \n\nDemocrats expressed alarm, signaling that they would resist any fundamental changes to the decades-old federal program. \n\n\"I feel like the administration is creating a war on Medicaid,\" said Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington.\n\n'Did the President lie?'\n\nThe hearing also raised questions as to whether Price has ever discussed GOP plans to dismantle Obamacare with the new president. \n\nIn one particularly colorful exchange, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, asked about an Obamacare replacement plan that Trump has been touting in public. \n\n\"President Trump said he's working with you on a replacement plan for the ACA which is nearly finished and will be revealed after your confirmation. Is that true?\" \n\n\"It's true that he said that, yes,\" Price said, an awkward response that drew laughter from the hearing room. \n\n\"Not that he's every done this before but did the President lie? Did the President lie about this, that he's not working with you?\" Brown tried. \"Did he lie to the public about working with you?\" \n\nPrice, again, would not say that he was working with Trump on an Obamacare alternative, saying instead: \"I've had conversations with the President about health care, yes.\" \n\nThe nominee also struggled to satisfy Democrats when pressed an executive order that Trump's signed in his first day in office aimed at weakening Obamacare. Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the panel, pressed the congressman to commit that \"no one will be worse off\" because of the executive order. \n\nPrice responded that he is committed to \"working with you and every single member of Congress to make certain we have the highest quality of health care\" and ensuring that \"everyone has access to affordable coverage.\" \n\nWyden bristled, saying Price had \"ducked the question.\" \n\nQuestions about his own health care plan\n\nPrice testified before the Senate Health Committee last week, but it is the Finance panel that will vote on advancing his nomination to the full Senate. \n\nThe timing of his confirmation is critical because Trump has said Republicans will release a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act as soon as Price is confirmed. GOP lawmakers have begun the legislative process to repeal large portions of Obamacare, but there is not yet clarity on crafting an alternative to the law. \n\nPrice, an ardent critic of Obamacare, has released a detailed proposal to overhaul the law. In last week's hearing, Price was pressed on multiple occasions to clarify Trump's -- as well as his own -- intentions on dismantling the health care law.\n\nOn Tuesday, Wyden blasted Price's past proposals, citing the congressman's budget and Obamacare repeal bills, which he said would hurt seniors by privatizing Medicare and gut Medicaid through block grants. And it would allow insurers to deny policies to sick Americans who didn't maintain continuous coverage. \n\n\"The Price plan takes America back to the dark days when health care worked only for the healthy and the wealthy,\" he said. \"When I look at Congressman Price's proposals, I don't see the patient at the center of health care. I see money and special interests at the center of health care.\" \n\nSeveral senators asked Price how he would carry out replacing Obamacare. \n\nOne of the top priorities, Price said, is to \"lower the temperature\" on the debate and let insurers know that \"help is on the way.\" Concerns are mounting that insurers could be spooked by the divisions over repealing and replacing the health reform law and opt not to participate in the individual market in 2018, potentially leaving millions without coverage. \n\nThe nominee also reiterated that Obamacare has such high premiums and deductibles that people don't feel they have insurance. Coverage doesn't equal care in many cases, he noted. \n\n\"They've got the card but they don't have any care because they can't afford the deductible that allows them to get the care,\" he said. \n\nOn the popular Affordable Care Act provision that bans insurers from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions, Price said: \"Nobody, in a system that pays attention to patients, nobody ought to be priced out of the market for having a bad diagnosis. What we need is a system that recognizes that pre-existing conditions do indeed exist.\" \n\nHowever, he did not go into detail on how he would protect these patients.\n\nEthics concerns\n\nIt wasn't just health care policy that had Price feeling the heat on Tuesday. The congressman again came under fire from Democrats for his financial investments, which have already raised a slew of ethics questions.\n\nAn orthopedic surgeon who has been a member of the House of Representatives for 12 years, Price has confronted accusations of investing in companies related to his legislative work in Congress -- and in some cases, repealing financial benefits from those investments. \n\nFinance Committee staff Monday also released a bipartisan memo to lawmakers disclosing several red flags that were raised in the course of reviewing Price's tax returns and financial disclosure statements. \n\nPressed on these inconsistencies, Price reiterated: \"Everything I did was ethical, above board legal and transparent,\" Price said. \"There isn't anything that you have divulged here that hasn't been public knowledge.\" \n\nOn why he had underestimated the value of his stocks in an Australian pharmaceutical company, Price said he had misunderstood how to calculate their value. \n\n\"When asked about the value, I thought it meant the value at the time that I purchased the stock,\" Price said. \n\nSen.

Here's what we know about Monday's crash:\n\nWhat happened? \n\nWhat we know: About 3:30 p.m. Monday, a school bus carrying 37 children slammed into a tree, flipped over and split apart. Families are mourning the six killed, and several children remain hospitalized in intensive care. The driver has been charged with vehicular homicide and reckless driving. Authorities say the bus was exceeding the 30-mph speed limit. \n\nThe NTSB was having some problems downloading video and data from the cameras and the engine control module on the bus because of damage, according to agency chairman Christopher Hart. \n\nWhat we don't know: How fast was the bus going? Why did the bus crash? What, if anything, affected the driver? What could have prevented the crash? \n\nInvestigators say they have a great deal of evidence to compile and process, including videos and interviews with the children and other witnesses. Investigators are reviewing videos from the three cameras on the bus -- one rear-facing, one forward-facing and one facing the entrance -- and an informational box on the bus to determine what caused the crash.\n\nHart said investigators were looking into why the bus was not on its designated route at the time of the crash.  \n\nThe driver\n\nWhat we know: Johnthony Walker, 24, has been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving. He could face more charges as the investigation unfolds.\n\n\"Mr. Walker lost control of the bus and swerved off of the roadway to the right, striking an elevated driveway and mailbox, swerved to the left and began to overturn, striking a telephone pole and a tree,\" according to the arrest affidavit. \n\nNo traces of alcohol or drugs were found in Walker's blood, lead police investigator Sgt. Austin Garrett. \n\nAfter the accident, Walker called his mother, Gwenevere Cook. She said her son tried to get the children off the bus. Cook described Walker as a responsible man who took care of his 3-year-old son. \n\nA co-worker at his other job at Amazon told CNN affiliate WSMV-TV that Walker worked two jobs to take care of his son. \"The picture that you paint of someone who'd do something like this is not the vibe I got from him,\" Breena Ross told the station. \n\n\"He was respectable. Just a very nice person.\" She added that he'd often come to work tired. \n\nWhat we don't know: Were there factors, such as fatigue or distractions, that may have affected his driving? \n\nHis driving record\n\nWhat we know: Walker received his commercial driving license in April, according to the NTSB.\n\nIn September, Walker was driving a school bus when he hit another vehicle, causing minor damage. The accident report cited Walker for \"failure to yield right of way.\" The driver in the other vehicle, in an interview with the Chattanooga Times Free Press, alleged that the school bus went through a stop sign and scraped her car. \n\nAlso in 2013, Walker was cited for failure to show proof of insurance. His driver's license was suspended for three weeks. It was reinstated in late March 2014, according to state records. \n\nWhat we don't know: What kind of vetting and training did Walker go through to become a school bus driver? How did the bus company investigate the September incident that Walker was involved in? Have there been prior complaints or issues reported about his driving to the company? \n\nThe bus \n\nWhat we know: The bus did not have seat belts. But Hart said it takes more than seat belts to prevent injuries. \n\nNTSB Chairman Hart & Go-team examine the scene of school bus crash #chattanoogabuscrash pic.twitter.com/vshYBh0rXW\u2014 NTSB_Newsroom (@NTSB_Newsroom) November 22, 2016\n\nWhat we don't know: Could seat belts on the school bus have prevented the deaths and injuries? The NTSB will be looking into what else could have been done to lessen the extent of the damage and injuries. \n\nWhy your child doesn't wear a seat belt on the school bus\n\nWere there any mechanical issues with the bus?\n\nThe bus company\n\nWhat we know: The company that operated the bus and employed Walker has come under scrutiny. Durham School Services, which transports more than 1 million students daily at schools across the United States, is contracted by Hamilton County.\n\nThe bus company in 2007 was given a \"conditional safety rating\" from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. It was later upgraded to \"satisfactory\" after the unspecified problems were resolved, Hart said. A website lists the most recent satisfactory rating date as July 31, 2015.\n\n\"We will be exploring what were the deficiencies,\" Hart said.\n\n\"Our entire team at Durham School Services is devastated by the accident yesterday that tragically claimed the lives of Chattanooga students,\" the company said in a statement. \n\nDurham CEO David Duke said in a YouTube statement that the company, which runs the bus service, was cooperating with the federal and local investigations.\n\n\"My responsibility now is to look for answers -- answers about why this tragedy occurred and answers for how we can make sure that this never, ever happens again,\" he said.\n\nDuke said he could not comment further.\n\n\"I don't want to compromise that investigation,\" he said. \"What I can do is promise that I'm determined, that we're determined to find out what happened. And that we will offer any support that we can to the families.\"\n\nWhat we don't know: Was there proper oversight?

The riot lasted for more than 17 hours. \n\nThe FDN controls drug trafficking and the \"inside of prison complexes,\" according to state media. Fontes said that the riot started over control of the drug trade behind the prison walls. \n\n\"They weren't fighting because one is called one thing and the other one is called another.

And even if federal authorities in Brooklyn fail to obtain a conviction in their wide-ranging conspiracy and drug trafficking indictment, Guzman faces similarly serious charges in California, Illinois, Florida, Texas and New Hampshire. \n\nBut there is an excellent chance it will end here for El Chapo, in Brooklyn.\n\nLet's talk for a moment about Brooklyn.\n\nProsecutors in Brooklyn's federal court, the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, have a reputation for handling sophisticated, high-profile cases ranging from terrorism to financial fraud and organized crime. Given the number of federal prosecutors competing to get El Chapo convicted, you can be sure the Department of Justice made a careful evaluation of the venue, with the strongest case, the most experienced prosecutors, best judges,  and courtroom and jail facilities capable of handling  the trial of such an infamous criminal defendant.\n\nBut there is another reason Brooklyn will likely best the Mexican drug kingpin, a man seemingly impervious to incarceration. El Chapo is about to learn the same lesson that I learned many years ago when I was recruited from Boston College Law School to commence my legal career as an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn: All human life intersects with Brooklyn. Some magical, mystical, magnetic force seems to draw the big and notorious cases to the borough.\n\nAlmost 3 million people from virtually every corner of the Earth reside in Brooklyn. Guzman will have the opportunity to meet some of them because they will sit on his jury, a diverse Brooklyn jury of the world-wise and  street-smart. They will not be shocked by prosecutors making deals with \"stool pigeons,\" snitches and paid informants.  They know El Chapo didn't hang out with Mother Teresa. They will look at the evidence with Brooklyn eyes and will likely convict him and consign him to a very spartan existence at a federal supermax prison. \n\nWhile he awaits trial, his thoughts will inevitably drift to his favorite hobby, escape. There is trouble on that horizon. El Chapo, who has escaped from at least two high-security Mexican prisons using sophisticated tunnels, will soon discover he is incarcerated, for the moment, at Manhattan's premier federal detention facility, the Metropolitan Correctional Center, which like the rest of Manhattan, sits on a base of solid bedrock. \n\nTo the south, Guzman would find himself tunneling into NYC police headquarters, while going in either a northerly or westerly direction would bring him directly into a state or federal courthouse. \n\nTo the southeast, he'd wind up in the swirling, frigid waters of the East River, narrowly missing some of lower Manhattan's fine Mexican restaurants. Overall, escape possibilities are grim, and the tabloids have previously reported that he has been going \"mad\" from a lack of sleep and sex with his beauty queen wife during the extradition process. \n\nBut when he gets his day in court, he can comfort himself with knowledge of the camera-ready notoriety that attaches to the Brooklyn venue.\n\nFilm fans may remember two cases that generated Academy Award-nominated films, the \"Wolf of Wall Street,\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the defendant and former stock-broker Jordan Belfort,  and, of course, \"American Hustle,\" a movie take on the infamous Abscam sting, which resulted in the arrest and conviction of US Sen. Harrison Williams and a host of other politicians.\n\nAnd we can reach back a little earlier in time to \"Dog Day Afternoon,\" which helped make Al Pacino's famous. The list goes on and on, which means El Chapo can be sure that when the film is made about his alleged crimes and Brooklyn trial, it will follow in the footsteps of Academy Award winners. While their footsteps were memorialized in cement on Hollywood Boulevard, his will likely take him to Colorado's famous supermax prison, from which no one ever escapes. \n\nProsecutors have handed down an extensive and impressive indictment. The Eastern District's US Attorney Robert Capers, who replaced Loretta Lynch when she became the US attorney general, summed it up best, describing Guzman's \"murderous rise\" and comparing him to a \"small cancerous tumor that metastasized and grew into a full-blown scourge that for decades littered the streets of Mexico with casualties of violent drug war\" before \"help[ing] to perpetrate the drug epidemic here in the US.\" \n\nThe chief problem prosecutors here face in handling Guzman's case will be the necessity of relying on informants and those \"stool pigeons,\" who will undoubtedly testify as a result of deals the prosecutors have made with them to secure testimony. \n\nJuries \u2014 in Brooklyn and everywhere else \u2014 find \"snitches\" to be distasteful and it's a particularly dangerous occupation. Worse yet, Guzman's still-operating billion-dollar drug operation may be poised to stop witnesses from testifying against the much feared El Chapo. \n\nThis is why the case is so important: The United States must send a message to criminals in other nations that if their actions harm the citizens of the United States, the US justice system will find a way to prosecute and incarcerate them. This means prosecutors will have to work hard to build a credible case and protect fearful witnesses, and possibly some jurors.\n\nProsecutors in Brooklyn would do well to remember the story of Abe Reles, a \"stool pigeon\" who was held in protective custody at Coney Island's Half Moon Hotel under the constant guard of six New York police detectives while waiting to testify in 1941's notorious \"Murder Incorporated\" trial. Sometime during the night before his testimony, Reles \"fell\" out the window of the Half Moon, and newspapers would later describe him as \"The Canary Who Could Sing, But Couldn't Fly.\"  \n\n Given the extensive nature of the charges against Guzman, prosecutors already have a cage full of canaries ready to sing to a Brooklyn jury. One suggestion regarding their care.

Dakota Access Pipeline has been granted every permit, approval, certificate, and right-of-way needed for the pipeline's construction. It is time for the Courts to end this political interference and remove whatever legal cloud that may exist over the right-of-way beneath federal land at Lake Oahe,\" said Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners.\n\nDelay welcomed\n\nMembers of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe welcomed the news of a delay in the project.\n\n\"We are all a little relieved that they are putting it off to take another look,\" Allison Renville, a tribe member, told CNN. \n\n\"But ultimately there is no negotiation when it comes to the pipeline. We won't consider this a win if the pipeline isn't stopped in its tracks.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Army Corps of Engineers halted further construction on and around the lake, because it \"has not made a final decision on whether to grant an easement,\" according to its statement. Further review was needed in consultation with the tribe, it said. \n\n\"The Army is mindful of the history of the Great Sioux Nation's repeated dispossessions, including those to support water-resources projects,\" said a letter sent to the tribe by Jo-Ellen Darcy, the assistant secretary of the Army (Civil Works). \"This history compels great caution and respect in considering the concerns that the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has raised regarding the proposed crossing of Lake Oahe.\" \n\nThe Army Corps said it would consult with the tribe regarding \"potential conditions on an easement\" that would reduce risks of spills and protect the water supply. It also pledged to complete the review \"expeditiously.\"\n\nDelay decried by pipeline backers \n\nBut the companies behind the Dakota Access Pipeline slammed the latest decision as \"lacking legal or factual justification.\" \n\n\"The Corps knows full well that it is seeking additional consultation with a party [Standing Rock Sioux Tribe] that has steadfastly refused to consult,\" said a joint statement Monday from Energy Transfer Partners and Sunonco Logistics Partners.\n\nLast Tuesday, Energy Transfer Partners announced that it had completed the pipeline on each side of Lake Oahe and was preparing to drill as it awaited the easement from the Army Corps. The project had previously received a permit from the Army Corps to tunnel under the lake, it said. \n\nWarren, Energy Transfer Partners' CEO, decried the decision as \"motivated purely by politics at the expense of a company that has done nothing but play by the rules it was given.\"\n\nDakota Access is a $3.7-billion project that backers have touted as the safest and most efficient way to transport oil, rather than using rail or trucks. Its proponents also say the pipeline could help the US become less dependent on importing energy from foreign countries. \n\nTribe says pipeline harms more than environment \n\nMeanwhile, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said the Army Corps' announcement wasn't 100% what it had sought, but showed that its concerns had been heard.  \n\n\"We are encouraged and know that the peaceful prayer and demonstration at Standing Rock have powerfully brought to light the unjust narrative suffered by tribal nations and Native Americans across the country,\" said Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II in a statement.\n\nIn addition to environmental concerns, the tribe has contended that the Dakota Access Pipeline threatens its members' economic well being, and its burial and prayer sites. \n\nMultiple groups have joined the protests. Throughout the months-long standoff, activists have routinely destroyed construction equipment as part of their protest.\n\nArchambault had told CNN previously that his tribe will settle for nothing less than stopping the pipeline's construction.\n\nAnd with President-elect Donald Trump poised to take power in January, Renville and others in the tribe worry they won't have a fighting chance if it's up to him to decide.\n\n\"In my own opinion, the more they push it off the more it's going to be up to Donald Trump to make the decision,\" Renville said.\n\nTrump has not commented on the pipeline but has discussed energy policy ideas suggesting he would support its completion.

The envisioned agreement with Britain is exactly the kind of bilateral pact that the Trump administration says is the model for US trade policy going forward.\n\nWith his White House being castigated for protectionist policies, a strong commitment to work towards such a deal would allow Trump to flesh out his point that he is not against all trade -- just big multi-national pacts that he deems punitive to the United States.\n\nHowever, he previewed the visit by griping that Democrats have yet to confirm his commerce secretary pick, Wilbur Ross.\n\n\"I'm meeting with the Prime Minister tomorrow, as you know. Great Britain ... I don't have my commerce secretary -- they want to talk trade. So, I'll have to handle it myself. Which is okay,\" he told Republican lawmakers in Philadelphia on Thursday.\n\nTrump also starts the meeting from May from a position of strength, given that he is granting her the honor of being his first foreign leader visit. But his need for a successful outcome became more acute on Thursday, when a spat with Mexico over his vow to build a border wall swiftly escalated and caused the cancellation of a visit to the White House next week by President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\n\n'Special relationship'\n\nMay is getting time in the office unusually early after a presidential inauguration.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama chose then-Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso as his first guest, a month after he was inaugurated. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was his second guest but their summit -- remembered mostly for its awkward body language and other distractions -- didn't take place until March.\n\nThat May will be in the Oval Office exactly seven days after Trump was inaugurated is being seen by her entourage as a sign of the new President's respect for Britain.\n\nTrump has often spoken of his administration for Queen Elizabeth II, and his mother's heritage in Scotland, where he owns two renowned golf courses.\n\nAltogether, the visit offers Trump a fairly unchallenging first assignment as a world leader, though his paucity of diplomatic and political experience means his demeanor and stagecraft will still be closely watched.\n\nAnd the careful choreography of his first week -- filled with rollouts of executive orders that fulfill key campaign promises -- has often been overshadowed by his penchant for making unpredictable statements and using disputed facts.\n\nSo it's not impossible the President could go off script or commit a diplomatic faux pas in front of the British press, which is always on the lookout for any linguistic nuance casting doubt on the \"special relationship\" -- a quirk that baffled the Obama administration in its initial engagements with the British.\n\nRELATED: British PM May: Praise for Trump -- but strong words, too\n\n'New age'\n\nMay plans to use the visit to stress that though Britain is leaving Europe and Trump is suspicious of US attachments abroad, the two nations can still combine to be a force that can shape the world.\n\n\"We are excited -- it speaks to the breadth and the depth of the special relationship that we are the first country to be visiting,\" a UK official told CNN.\n\n\"As we rediscover our confidence together -- as you renew your nation just as we renew ours -- we have the opportunity, indeed the responsibility, to renew the 'special relationship' for this new age,\" May told GOP lawmakers Thursday in Philadelphia, her first US stop. \"We have the opportunity to lead, together, again.\"\n\nThe British Prime Minister will also have the benefit of the advice of former President Barack Obama, who urged her to develop a close relationship with Trump in the hope that she and other center-right world leaders could be a moderating influence on him, according to a former senior administration official and a UK official familiar with the conversations.\n\nRELATED: Friendliness with Trump will give Theresa May a European headache\n\nNATO, climate concerns\n\nBut while the body language may well be positive between Trump and May, they still have their share of disagreements.\n\nMay's visit will be the first test of some of Trump's most controversial views on foreign policy, ones that put him at odds with the bulk of US allies.\n\nTrump's statements that NATO is obsolete and that he wants to improve relations with a Russia that has been testing the borders of post-Cold War Europe have triggered alarm on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nTrump's hostility to environmental regulations introduced by the Obama administration to comply with the international Paris climate agreement are also sparking opposition to the new White House in the UK.\n\nMay also was critical of Trump's conduct towards women following revelations about his past during the election campaign.\n\nThe no-nonsense Prime Minister is making clear that while she plans to forge a close relationship with Trump, she will not hesitate to speak her mind.\n\n\"I am not afraid to speak frankly to the President of the United States,\" May said in Parliament on Wednesday. \"I am able to do that because we have this special relationship.\"\n\nMay is likely to impress upon Trump the importance  and continued vitality of NATO. Britain's calls for all members to meet their military spending target of 2% of GDP, may allow her government to become a point of liaison between states in the Western alliance and the new president, who has frequently groused that US allies have not done enough to pay for their own defense.\n\nAnd then there are their backgrounds, which provide little common ground.\n\nThe President is brash, boastful, larger than life, obsessed with his self-image and not prone to delving deeply into the details of policy.\n\nMay, a clergyman's daughter, is conservative, self-contained and renowned for poring over briefing books late at night. Her only visible flamboyance is a penchant for leopard skin kitten heels.\n\nRELATED: Obama's advice to British PM: Befriend Donald Trump\n\nTurbulent times\n\nBut while they may not be soulmates, Trump and May both find themselves caught up in the tectonic shifts that have rocked modern politics and felled the establishment on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nTrump, the master of disruption, backed the British exit from the EU and hopes more countries follow suit -- in direct contravention of decades of US foreign policy that saw stability in a united Europe.\n\nMay did not back Brexit, but in the political carnage that followed the vote suddenly found herself prime minister and must now manage the most volatile political turbulence in Western Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\n\"I think that both Trump and May actually have strong appeal to Middle America and Middle England, and I think there are some similarities in their approach,\" said Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation.\n\n\"I would expect their partnership to actually be a very strong one even though their characters may be somewhat different in some respects,\" he predicted.\n\nGardiner believes that after falling behind Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel in the eyes of the Obama administration, the arrival of Trump is likely to repair Britain's importance to US transatlantic relations over the next four years.\n\nTrump's hostility to the European Union and equating of Brexit voters to kindred spirits with his own supporters who powered a rupturing of the political establishment also may cause him to look kindly on Britain.\n\nA Trump trip to the country as president is widely expected to take place in the summer.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.18081176280975, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1286, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.38630475702, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.41057542768274, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/health/obamacare-florida-republican/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1051, "scraper_regex": 1165}}, "headline": "Republican Obamacare fan hopes Trump's stance softens", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1165, "date": "20170106020000", "story_content": "If it had been only about what was best for him, Bob Ruscoe would have cast his ballot for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But he's a staunch Republican, always has been, and that meant this Obamacare beneficiary struggled over his November vote in a way he never had before.  \n\n\"I agonized over the decision,\" he said. \"Part of me was saying, 'if she gets in, at least we won't have to worry about health care for four years.' \" \n\nRuscoe, 57, of West Palm Beach, Florida, is self-employed and knows the insecurity of going uninsured. He took advantage of the Affordable Care Act the minute he could.\n\nAbout 20 million people gained health care coverage through Obamacare. With more than 1.7 million Floridians enrolled as of February, the Sunshine State has the highest percentage of Obamacare recipients in the country. And yet Ruscoe was among the majority of Florida voters who checked the box for Donald Trump, the candidate who promised time and again to spike the program Ruscoe couldn't wait to have.\n\n\"We'll have to see what pans out,\" he said. \"It may not be totally repealed. It may be something else. I hope something will remain in place.\" \n\nHe went with the candidate he thinks will make America stronger. \n\n\"I did what I thought was correct for the overall good of the country,\" he said. \"Economic strength cures a lot of things.\" \n\nA better economy, he hopes, will free him from needing subsidies.\n\nHaving no choice\n\nFor most of his adult life, health insurance was a comfort Ruscoe took for granted. Between him and his wife, at least one of them had a job with health care benefits. \n\nHe left his position in ceiling fan sales to venture out on his own about 13 years ago, only after their daughter was grown, the house was mostly paid off and he had a little pension. Ruscoe is responsible like that.\n\nThen, his wife lost her job. Other than the nasal polyps that have long plagued his sinuses, they were a pretty healthy pair. Plus, they had the option of COBRA coverage for 18 months. \n\nThat benefit ran out, though, and so did prospects for health insurance -- at least for him. Ruscoe weighed about 300 pounds at the time, and try as he might, he couldn't find a policy to cover him. He knew he could stand to lose some weight, but he'd been an amateur athlete and remained active and strong. He didn't see himself as unhealthy, but that didn't matter. \n\n\"They wouldn't sell it to me at any price,\" he said. \"It was the reality of the situation. I didn't have a choice.\"\n\nStill, Ruscoe, who's since lost 100 pounds, doesn't blame anyone but himself.\n\n\"I was overweight, so I was a risk,\" he said. \"I wouldn't have wanted to insure myself.\" \n\n'Coming out of the rain'\n\nFor his wife, he bought catastrophic coverage. It wasn't cheap -- about $200 a month -- and it came with a whopping $25,000 deductible. This meant they both avoided doctors as much as they could. \n\nSo on those occasions when his sinuses swelled shut and he couldn't sleep for days at a time, he felt helpless.\n\n\"I had no reasonable means to get help,\" Ruscoe remembered.\n\nHe's a liquidator, and his wife joined him in the business. They buy abandoned storage unit items and goods leftover from estate sales and then resell them. It's a physical job that keeps him lifting objects, transporting boxes and jumping into and out of big moving trucks. \n\nRuscoe has gotten some nasty gashes along the way, but he had no problem taping those up himself. But when he tumbled out of a truck, a year or so before Obamacare emerged, being uninsured terrified him.\n\nHe remembers the moment his foot got stuck and he began to fall. He says he felt like Wile E. Coyote, of Looney Tunes fame, hanging in the air right before gravity kicked in. The thought bubble above his head would have read, \"This is really going to suck,\" he said. \n\nWhen he hit the ground, he couldn't breathe. After he caught his breath and began to wiggle his fingers and toes, he was stunned to be in one piece. He got bruised up but knew it could have been a lot worse. Had he landed differently, medical expenses might have ruined him.\n\nSo Ruscoe took notice when the Affordable Care Act began making news. \n\n\"I thought it was a good idea, even though I'm a conservative,\" he said. \"It's a social program, but a lot of social programs are for the good. And this is one of them.\"\n\nThe moment the website went live, he was online, ready to sign up. It had been several years since he'd been insured, and he remembers the relief that came over him. \n\n\"It's the feeling of coming out of the rain, if you will,\" he said. \"You can do all you can to get healthy. You try to be safe. But there's a certain amount of fate that's just out there.\" \n\nNo guarantees\n\nThe value of coverage was immediate. During wellness checks, something he and his wife had ditched in their time without insurance, she learned that she had high cholesterol. And though he'd worked hard to lose a significant amount of weight, he'd plateaued. Once a doctor offered nutritional counseling, he shed the last 40 pounds.\n\nIrrespective of political persuasion, he says, having access to services that keep people healthy makes sense. He couldn't understand friends who didn't take advantage of the health care opportunity.\n\n\"It's made to be affordable for everyone. Why wouldn't you?\" he asked.\n\nCome February 1, he'll be paying about $338 a month for himself and his wife. Without Obamacare, he says, the same plan would cost them $1,150 a month -- or close to $14,000 a year. Rates like that would mean no more insurance for them. \n\nThey're not getting any younger, and Ruscoe knows that there are no guarantees when it comes to health. He thinks of his grandmother who died of colon cancer and talks about the importance of preventative medicine, including access to procedures like colonoscopy.\n\n\"I'll be bellying up to get my first one this year,\" he said. \n\nWithout insurance, he's not sure that would be possible for him and his wife.\n\nRuscoe doesn't pretend to know how cost-effective Obamacare is and assumes it requires tweaking. But he hopes the Trump administration will recognize and hold onto what's worked. \n\nHe  feels like it's his \"civic duty\" to speak up, he says. It's important to remind people that slashes to coverage may lead to \"a segment of the population that'll be left swinging in the breeze.\" \n\nHis views will surprise some of his friends, he suspects.\n\n\"They'll freak out that I was strongly considering voting for Clinton,\" he said. \"But I think she would have been very compassionate, and you need that.\" \n\nRuscoe's now banking on Trump showing some compassion, too.

Reality is becoming hazy in the era of Trump. And that's no accident.\n\nThe fact is Trump has become America's gaslighter in chief. \n\nIf you've never heard the term, prepare to learn it and live with it every day. Unless Trump starts behaving in a radically different way after he becomes President, gaslighting will become one of the words of 2017.\n\nThe term comes from the 1930s play \"Gas Light\" and the 1940s Hollywood movie version (Gaslight) in which a manipulative husband tries to unmoor his wife, played by Ingrid Bergman, by tampering with her perception of reality. He dims the gaslights and then pretends it's only she who thinks they are flickering as the rooms grow darker. \n\nThat's only the beginning. He uses a variety of truth-blurring techniques. His goal is to exert power and control by creating doubts about what is real and what isn't, distracting her as he attempts to steal precious jewels.\n\nMental health professionals have made much of the practice, said to be a favorite of narcissists and abusive spouses. But more recently the tactical tampering with the truth has become a preferred method of strongmen around the world. Gaslighting by other means was always a common feature of dictatorships, but it has found new vogue as a more subtle form of domestic political control even in countries with varying degrees of democracy.\n\nNow Trump has brought it to the United States. The techniques include saying and doing things and then denying it, blaming others for misunderstanding, disparaging their concerns as oversensitivity, claiming outrageous statements were jokes or misunderstandings, and other forms of twilighting the truth.\n\nRecall the presidential campaign. By early summer, Trump had already accumulated a long list of statements he made and then denied making; enough that fact-checkers could hardly keep up. He told his supporters to \"knock the crap out\" of protesters at his rallies, adding \"I will pay your legal fees.\" When confronted with the statement, he responded: \"I didn't say that.\" \n\nAfter mimicking a disabled reporter and seeing the video used as evidence against him, he repeatedly denied it, claiming his opponents should be embarrassed to say he did. \"I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!\" The denials continued after Meryl Streep brought up the subject this week at the Golden Globes. With the video easily available, Trump's argument boiled down to \"Who do you trust, me or your lying eyes?\" \n\nWhen Trump says something that outrages a portion of the population and pleases one segment, he can have it both ways. Voters eager for a tough guy president may be happy with the bully, while those who don't like it might be appeased by the denial. In the end, few people can keep up with all the facts all the time. And as he tries to undercut the credibility of serious journalists, he makes it even harder for everyone else to find an easy path to the truth.\n\nJust before Friday's intelligence briefing on Russian hacks, Trump approvingly tweeted about Julian Assange's statements denying Russian involvement. When he was criticized for trusting the head of WikiLeaks more than US intelligence professionals, he accused the \"dishonest media\" of claiming he agreed with Assange.\n\nThe fact is, many people hear only Trump's version of events, and polls show many people believe even the most obvious distortions of the truth. \n\nHe's just getting started, but compared with the man he admires so much, he's a rank amateur at gaslighting. \n\nIn Russia, the truth became a matter of opinion under a strategy implemented by a clever aide to President Vladimir Putin, Vladislav Surkov. Surkov, who has a background in the arts, orchestrated a kind of political theater in Russia, creating a gauzy fa\u00e7ade where no one knew which group was a creation of the government and which wasn't. \n\nHe reportedly financed liberal groups and neo-Nazi skinheads. Russian politics became theater, and Putin gradually gained almost total control, with the independent media gradually disappearing as an alternative to journalists loyal to the government.\n\nRussia's false reality then moved from the domestic arena to global theater. When \"little green men\" made their appearance in Ukraine's Crimea, Russia denied that there were Russian operatives in unmarked uniforms. And when pro-Russian militias emerged in Ukraine and elsewhere, Moscow claimed they emerged spontaneously in a quest for independence, even as Russian military forces moved into position in a sovereign country.\n\nRussia even tried to gaslight US voters, as intelligence agencies concluded, trying to undermine their faith in the democratic process. And when Moscow thought Trump would lose, it planned to promote the view that the election was stolen, under the #DemocracyRIP banner, a plan whose seeds Trump had already planted.\n\nThe challenge will be a steep one for journalists and for all Americans, when so much of what comes from the next president has to be checked and double-checked. The first step is to establish when there is a gaslighting operation in progress. \n\nThen comes the battle to hold on to the facts.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.17821788787842, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 941, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.64106164479, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110200000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.70031880977683, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/12/politics/donald-trump-kids-nepotism-law/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Could Donald Trump's kids serve in his administration?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 589, "date": "20161112150000", "story_content": "As President-elect Donald Trump was huddling Thursday in the Oval Office with President Barack Obama, his son-in-law was on the other side of the windows, strolling the South Lawn with Obama's top aide Denis McDonough.\n\nThe sight of Jared Kushner, a publisher and businessman, pacing the grounds with Obama's chief of staff left many speculating the husband of Ivanka Trump was in line to assume a top West Wing role come January. \n\nAfter all, Kushner, 35, played a central, if undefined, role in Trump's campaign. He was seen as a shadow campaign manager, orchestrating key events while maintaining a trusted line of communication to the temperamental candidate.\n\nThe same is true for Trump's three adult children: Donald Jr, Eric, and Ivanka. Along with Kushner, all were listed as members of Trump's Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee in a shakeup of the organization on Friday.\n\nTeam Trump is already filled with Washington insiders\n\nBut any further ambitions to serve their father in an official capacity during his presidency may be curtailed by federal law. A statute passed in 1967 states no public official -- from the President down to a low-level manager at a federal agency -- may hire or promote a relative. The law was regarded as a rebuttal to President John F. Kennedy's appointment of his brother Robert as attorney general.\n\nKushner, who is related to Trump by marriage but not blood, would still be ineligible. The law specifies \"son-in-law\" as a type of relative covered by the rule.\n\nTrump's other children would similarly be barred from holding posts in a Trump cabinet, or in the West Wing. Trump named Ivanka as a potential cabinet appointee during the campaign when asked which women he might select as part of his team. Donald Trump Jr. has been mentioned as a potential Interior secretary.\n\nThere could be ways to skirt the ban. The law reads that any appointee found to have violated the law is \"not entitled to pay\" by the federal government, raising the notion that Kushner or Trump's children could forgo paychecks while still serving the administration.\n\nBut doing so would risk putting their decisions on shaky legal ground, experts say.\n\n\"While it's true that the penalty for violation of the statute is just to withhold salary or other financial remuneration from the wrongfully appointed employee, there's also the possibility that any action taken by such a wrongfully appointed employee could be subject to legal challenge and potentially even be voidable,\" said Steve Vladeck, a CNN contributor and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law.\n\nThat would be a risky proposition for a chief of staff, who is the highest-ranking decision-maker in the West Wing aside from the president himself. If Kushner or Trump's children assume less-specific \"senior adviser\" roles in Trump's White House, their individual actions may be less apparent.\n\nTrump's relatives could serve in other roles in Washington, as long as they're not under the executive branch umbrella. They could take jobs on Capitol Hill, acting as a go-between for their father's administration and lawmakers. Or they could be appointed as the heads of task forces, as Hillary Clinton was during her husband's administration.\n\nWho could be in Trump's cabinet?\n\nOr Trump could appoint them to his administration as a challenge to the law, which some believe is an unconstitutional check on a president's power.\n\nThat, however, would almost certainly set up a prolonged court battle at the beginning of Trump's term in office, a distraction as he works to implement his campaign promises.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.4429967403411896, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 564, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 15, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.285281363419999, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161112150000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 3.90070921985816, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/us/dictionary-words-campaign-moments-trnd/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00eb": [6939]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1190, "scraper_regex": 1482}}, "headline": "12 most searched words during historic US election 2016", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1482, "date": "20161108190000", "story_content": "We learned a lot of new things during this election: The size of Trump's hands, how many deplorables can fit into a basket and the fact that Trump Tower serves the best taco bowls. Add to that, all of the new words we added to our national lexicon.\n\nMerriam-Webster -- which describes itself as the most trustworthy collection of English words -- compiled the 58 words that Americans went online to look up during this unprecedented US presidential campaign.\n\nHere are the top 12: \n\n1. Trumpery\n\nWe start with trumpery, which means worthless nonsense.\n\nWhile the word might seem to be a play on the last name of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, it has been around since the 15th century. In 1755, Samuel Johnson suggested \"empty talk\" as a definition for the term in his great dictionary.\n\nWhile the origin of the word has nothing to do with Donald Trump, his emergence as a strong political candidate brought the obscure word into the light of day. Searches for trumpery have spiked since the end of 2015, as social media users shared the original meaning of the word.\n\n2. Presumptive\n\nThen comes presumptive, another word deeply tied to Trump during the elections. It's just a fancier way to say \"probable,\" but it spiked 504% following Trump's decisive victory in the Indiana primary and the decision of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz to drop out of the election race. \n\n3. Glass ceiling\n\nWords connected to the Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton, also made the list as she shattered a \"glass ceiling\" to potentially win the top job in the nation.\n\nThe expression, used to describe an unfair system which prevents certain groups from obtaining powerful jobs due to their race or gender, was always popular with Clinton. \n\n\"Although we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it's got about 18 million cracks in it,\" Clinton said following her loss to Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nBut she did not give up, and the term \"glass ceiling\" spiked in searches again on June 7-8 as primary victories in several states gave strength to Clinton's campaign. Will it crack tonight? \n\n4. Plagiarism\n\nAnother woman who has become known for her words -- or her ability to replicate others' words -- during the election was Melania Trump. \n\nOn July 19 the word \"plagiarism\" trended worldwide after Mrs. Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention. \n\nIt was, without a doubt, the most memorable speech of the night, but the reason it trended all over social media was because her speechwriters borrowed entire passages from Michelle Obama's 2008 talk at the Democratic National Convention. \n\nDonald Trump Questions Melania Plagiarism ChargeArtist: R.J. Matson pic.twitter.com/K8XYlCUgvg\u2014 David Phillips (@yodasworld) July 19, 2016\n\n5. Oligarchy (and socialism)\n\nFormer candidate Bernie Sanders sent people rushing to online dictionaries after using the term \"oligarchy\" -- something he said  Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would work against. \n\n\"Hillary Clinton will nominate justices to the Supreme Court who are prepared to overturn Citizens United and end the movement toward oligarchy in this country,\" he said in July at the Democratic National Convention. \n\nFor Sanders, an America run by Donald Trump could become a complete oligarchy, which means, by the way, a government in which power is in the hands of a small, select group of people who serve their own selfish interests.  \n\nThe word \"socialism\" also spiked during this period, as Sanders called himself a democratic socialist. In case you don't know, socialism is a political theory in which \"major industries are owned and controlled by the government rather than by individual people and companies,\" according to Merriam-Webster.\n\n6. Redacted\n\nPoliticians weren't the only ones making words famous in this election. This one comes from the FBI.\n\n\"Redacted\" became popular in August after the FBI gave Congress materials from its investigation into Clinton's private email server.\n\nIt also was heavily searched this month -- a week before Election Day, in fact -- after the FBI released files described as \"heavily redacted\" from its 2001 investigation of President Bill Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich.\n\n7. Bigot\n\nAside from technical terms, words used as insults also prompted a lot of online research in 2016. \"Bigot\" was a popular one, according to Merriam-Webster. \n\nOnline searches for \"bigot\" spiked dramatically on August 24, after nominee Donald Trump used it to attack his fellow candidate by shouting, \"Hillary Clinton is a bigot!\" \n\nOf course, the word -- which describes someone who is devoted to their own opinions and prejudices -- has been used to attack both candidates on social media. \n\nClinton is also a bigot. So that goes for her too.  https://t.co/wcOKeHvN0Q\u2014 Jill Oh (@jjsattorney) June 9, 2016\n\nWhether Trump loses or wins, he will still be a xenophobic, misogynistic, racist, fear mongering bigot. #HailTheThief #ElectionFinalThoughts\u2014 Seth Goodtime (@SethGoodtime) November 7, 2016\n\nIn case you're wondering about the word's etymology (its origin and history -- don't say you didn't learn anything here today!), it originally came from the French language and meant a \"superstitious religious hypocrite\" in the 16th century. \n\n8. Hombre\n\nSpeaking of foreign words, \"hombre,\" the Spanish word for man, also made the list, in a HYUUUUGE way.\n\nSearches for \"hombre\" spiked 120,000% after Donald Trump used it in the final presidential debate. \n\n\"We have some bad, bad people in this country... We'll get them out, secure the border and once the border is secured at a later date we'll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here and we're going to get them out,\" he said. \n\nSocial media users jumped on the #BadHombre trend with memes and other jokes, adding to the list of craziness from this campaign -- prompting some to compare it to a comedy sketch.\n\nSometimes I forget this is a presidential debate and not an SNL skit #badhombres\u2014 Ian Mayberry (@ian_mayberry) October 20, 2016\n\n9. Braggadocious\n\n\"Braggadocious\" is one to remember. It seems an arrogant word to use, and it means just that. Searches for \"braggadocious\" -- not to be confused with \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" -- increased after Donald Trump showed off his vocabulary in the debate with Hillary Clinton on September 26. \n\nBut don't worry if you never heard of it. The word is so obscure that it doesn't even merit an entry in the Merriam-Webster dictionary. \n\nThe term, which was scarcely used even in the 17th century from whence it came (again, you're learning! you're welcome), used to be shortened to \"braggart.\"\n\nBut some social media users appreciated the vocabulary lesson, and used it in their Halloween decorations.\n\nArt is political \ud83c\udf83#happyhalloween #donaldtrumpkin #wrong #braggadocious #nastywoman pic.twitter.com/BTGY7HuQOm\u2014 Chlo\u00eb Hill (@Chloeritahill) October 31, 2016\n\n10. Deplorables \n\n\"Deplorables\" was not used to describe the candidates, but one candidate's supporters.\n\n\"To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it,\" said Hillary Clinton at a fund-raiser in New York.\n\nDonald Trump's campaign quickly demanded an apology for the remark.\n\nWhile Clinton later said she regretted using it, the word definitely marked the US elections. Some of Trump's supporters even took it as a compliment and started using it as a catchphrase online.\n\n11. Locker-room talk\n\nOut of the dark, stinky locker and into the light of day came \"locker-room talk.\" The expression, which describes conversations of a sexual or offensive nature that should not happen in public, was used by candidate Donald Trump to downplay leaked conversations in which he made lewd and aggressive comments about women.\n\n\"I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I'm not proud of it. But this is locker room talk,\" he said in his defense.\n\nHowever, several US athletes denounced Trump's use of the phrase to describe his comments. They shared videos online saying that such conversations have no place, not even in locker rooms. \n\n12. Nasty\n\nYes, overall, this long, long campaign season got \"nasty.\" \n\nIn the final moments of the last presidential debate, Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton was \"such a nasty woman\" for her plan to raise taxes on the rich to tackle debt and entitlements.\n\nWhile \"nasty\" is one of the most common words on this list, it's still a winner, judging from its popularity through the ages. For more than 700 years now, nasty still means \"unpleasant.\"\n\nYet -- much like Trump's \"deplorables\" -- Clinton supporters embraced \"nasty\" and made it their own. \n\nActress Lena Dunham even started a Twitter movement to embrace the adjective used to describe Clinton.\n\nRT if you're a nasty woman and it's made your life a freakin' pleasure\u2014 Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) October 20, 2016\n\nSo how will the 2016 election be remembered? Some will call it nasty, or deplorable, or a trumpery. But to our friends at Merriam-Webster it was stupefying, reptilian and most of all...

Unless his advisers take away his Internet access, the basic means of communication that he used as a candidate will become his bully pulpit as president for the next four years. He will continue to provide, in 140-character bursts, nonstop commentary from the Oval Office and -- on the weekends -- from Trump Tower in New York City.\n\nThis past weekend, \"Saturday Night Live\" featured a blistering skit, with Alec Baldwin as Trump, obsessing over retweeting the rants of his followers, from high schoolers on up, instead of paying attention to security briefings from officials who are having trouble swallowing that the inauguration is weeks away. Of course, in real life, Trump couldn't resist tweeting a response: \"Just tried watching Saturday Night Live -- unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad.\" \n\nJust tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016\n\nThere are some virtues to what he has done. Every so often, a new president displays a feel for media and demonstrates how it can be used to make his case politically. In the right hands, Twitter could indeed become a powerful way for elected officials to break through some of the rigid barriers imposed by the news media, interest groups and partisan leaders. \n\nAs with radio in the 1930s, back when many Americans felt that Franklin D. Roosevelt was speaking directly to them in their living rooms amid a horrendous economic crisis, Twitter creates a sense of intimacy, letting citizens know what is going on and connecting them to their politicians.\n\nBut that's not what we've seen from most of Donald Trump's tweets. Perhaps before he starts his time in the White House, it would be useful to lay down a few of the ground rules about what politicians should avoid when they start to tap characters into the \"What's Happening\" box and instantly share them with the world. \n\nSome rules: \n\nDon't tweet about foreign leaders and foreign policy\n\n One of the most difficult parts of serving as the commander in chief is handling the delicacies of foreign policy. Each statement uttered by the president of the United States can have huge ramifications, even creating dangerous situations for our military and our citizens. Some Soviet leaders were reportedly shaken when word leaked that President Reagan, who was joking, said during a microphone check before a 1984 news conference: \"My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.\" \n\nInternational relations are extremely tricky, given that the president is dealing with so many nations, each with its own history, its own perception of events, its own internal tensions. When foreign leaders hear or read something from the president, they will naturally read into the statement some kind of signal about what the US might do.\n\nIt's not always easy to know when someone is joking. The wrong statement can easily insult a leader or even instigate a movement in another country, resulting in violence or the breakdown of diplomatic relations. So when Fidel Castro passes away, tweeting \"Fidel Castro is dead!\" is exactly the kind of tweet that can't be acceptable.\n\nFidel Castro is dead!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2016\n\nTrump's tweets after Castro's death, including \"If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the US as a whole, I will terminate deal,\" amounted to diplomatic threats.\n\nIf Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016\n\nAfter coming under criticism for taking a call from the president of Taiwan, breaking four decades of diplomatic practice, Trump responded by firing off more tweets:  \"The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!\" \n\nThe President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016\n\nAnd then: \"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,\" as he sank deeper into potentially threatening a showdown with China. \n\nInteresting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016\n\nSoon after this happened, China lodged a complaint with the United States about what the President-elect had done. \"We urge the relevant side in the US to adhere to the 'one China' policy, abide by the pledges in the three joint China-US communiqu\u00e9s, and handle issues related to Taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall China-U.S. relationship.\"\n\nWhat did Trump do? Push out tweets critical of China's handling of its currency and of its actions in the South China Sea.\n\nDid China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into..\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016\n\ntheir country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?  I don't think so!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016\n\nDon't offer knee-jerk reactions to terrorism\n\nOur national security challenges require great caution from leaders. With terrorism as the major threat that we face on a daily basis, elected officials have the difficult job of keeping calm amidst tragedy and remaining extremely cautious when making statements about what has happened in a given event: the wrong words can dangerously inflame passions or provide skewed interpretations.\n\nMany older Americans will remember how the media initially blamed Muslims for the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, although it turned out that white nationalists were behind the carnage. The role of the leader is to maintain a national security infrastructure that protects citizens, to guide Americans through troubled times and to maintain calm as the government responds to acts of violence. His job is not to target particular social groups or make poorly informed statements about public policy.\n\nAfter the recent Ohio State University shooting, Trump responded: \"ISIS is taking credit for the terrible stabbing attack at Ohio State University by a Somali refugee who should not have been in our country.\" \n\nISIS is taking credit for the terrible stabbing attack at Ohio State University by a Somali refugee who should not have been in our country.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016\n\nIt seems inevitable, unfortunately, that during Trump's presidency there will be more acts of violence, and he would do better if he refrained from using this medium to make statements about what happens, other than to offer calming words.\n\nDon't attack individual reporters or specific media organizations \n\nIt is absolutely vital to the health of our democracy that journalists feel that they have the freedom and the space to produce honest accounts of what's going on in Washington and to offer readers and viewers hard-hitting stories about our nation's leaders. \n\nTo be sure, they shouldn't expect that this will be easy. Presidents have often lashed out against the press when they come under attack; recall President Nixon's hostility to the press and his vice president, Spiro Agnew, commenting on the \"nattering nabobs of negativism.\"\n\nIn his recent tweets, Trump has gone after specific people. When CNN's Jeff Zeleny reported that there was no evidence to support Trump's assertion of massive voter fraud, Trump retweeted aggressive statements from his followers -- \"what PROOF do u have DonaldTrump did not suffer from millions of FRAUD votes? Journalist do your job!\" and \"just another generic CNN part time wannabe journalist!\"\n\n\"@HighonHillcrest: @jeffzeleny what PROOF do u have DonaldTrump did not suffer from millions of FRAUD votes? Journalist? Do your job! @CNN\"\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016\n\nAfter a few more of those, Trump issued his own blast against @CNN. These kinds of tweets should not be part of the presidential arsenal. In an atmosphere that quickly turns hostile and aggressive (many Jewish journalists, for instance, found themselves under attack from anti-Semites during this campaign) the president can't legitimize such practices. Journalists may become scared of reporting on the facts, and news organizations may fear punitive action against them for being too tough on the White House.\n\nDon't spread false allegations\n\nThe thing about Twitter is that there are no editorial filters. When the president makes a claim, it instantly goes out to all his followers, becomes the subject of reporting and national conversation and can quickly be seen as the truth. While it is true that all presidents tell lies, it has only been a few weeks since the election, and we have seen the President-elect make a series of stunning claims that have no foundation in serious evidence. \n\nMany were taken aback when Trump tweeted that \"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\" Trump went on to claim that there was \"serious voter fraud\" in states like Virginia, New Hampshire and California. \n\nIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016\n\nNot only is his claim patently false, but it undermines public confidence in the election process without any justification, continuing a strategy he employed in the final month of his election when he couldn't stop speaking about a \"rigged election.\"\n\nMore troubling is the fact that this assertion will lend support to the ongoing campaign among some conservatives to make voting more difficult and cumbersome through voter fraud laws. In an era when it is becoming harder to tell fact from fiction, the president must be an apostle of truth, demonstrating extreme discipline and not putting out false claims that produce dangerous decisions. \n\nDon't threaten individuals or individual business\n\nTwitter is not an appropriate mechanism for the president, or president-elect, to start issuing threats. In one of his recent tweets, Trump started to threaten any business that moved its factories overseas with a 35% tariff. \n\nwithout retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ......\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016\n\nMost economic experts are dubious that the president would have this legal authority. But even if he did, Twitter is not a platform for the president to use his authority to try to scare people into action. This can have dangerous consequences for the market and for civil liberties. Given Trump's extensive business interests -- and it is unclear if he is planning to let go of any of them while he is president -- this will also cause concerns about how he might be using his office to advance his own economic interests.

Voters will also decide whether it should be used for medical reasons in four other states.\n\nThe drug is still illegal under federal law, but it has grown in popularity over the years. The number of adults who have smoked weed has nearly doubled in three years, according to a Gallup poll released in August. \n\nIt is the No. 1 illicit drug of choice for Americans, according to the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use, although only one-third of users reported an addiction to the substance, unlike most all the other illicit drugs used. \n\nCurrently, it's legal to use recreational marijuana only in four states and in the District of Columbia. Colorado and Washington state voted to OK it in 2012. Alaska and Oregon voters approved it in 2014. Medical marijuana is legal in half of US states and is on state ballots this year in Montana, Florida and North Dakota. It will be on the ballot in Arkansas with two initiatives, but the results won't count for one of them, after the state Supreme Court struck the issue in October, due to invalid signatures. \n\nFor the states where recreational use is legal, it seems to have been a boost to the economy. The marijuana industry created more than 18,000 full-time jobs last year and generated $2.39 billion in economic activity in Colorado, according to an analysis from the Marijuana Policy Group.   \n\nThere have also been some health consequences. Emergency rooms have seen a significant increase in adult marijuana-related exposure cases. \n\nThe number of calls to poison control centers involving Colorado children has gone up, as has the number of children who've been taken to the hospital for treatment due to unintentional marijuana exposure, studies show. There have also been more school suspensions, marijuana-related traffic deaths, pet poisonings and lab explosions.\n\nHere's what's on the ballot.\n\nCalifornia\n\nIf marijuana becomes legal in California, the world's sixth-largest economy and the country's most populous state, it could have the biggest impact on the national scene. \n\nIn 1996, the state was the first to make medical marijuana legal.\n\nA \"yes\" on Proposition 64 would make it legal for people 21 or older to use it recreationally. There would be a 15% sales tax, and its cultivation would be taxed. The money would be used in part to study drug research, to study treatment and to help with enforcement of the law.\n\nThe state's two largest newspapers back the measure, as does the California Democratic Party, while Republicans are against it. \n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told the Los Angeles Times Friday that she plans to vote in favor of it. That makes Pelosi the highest-ranking, sitting elected official in either political party to support legalizing a drug the federal government currently considers a Schedule 1 narcotic. A Schedule 1 narcotic is a drug with no currently accepted medical use and has a high potential for abuse. The category also includes heroin.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMassachusetts already has some marijuana-friendly laws. Medical marijuana became legal in 2012, and a 2008 ballot measure replaced criminal penalties with civil penalties on adults who possess an ounce or less.\n\nQuestion 4, as the recreational use measure is called, would legalize it and allow the commonwealth to tax and regulate its use and sale, much like the way alcohol is handled. That means people 21 and older could use it, possess it or grow it. They can have under 10 ounces in their home and under 1 ounce in public and be allowed to grow six plants. \n\nA number of politicians there support it, as does the American Civil Liberties Union. \n\nMassachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, opposes legalization, as does Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a Democrat. Baker argued that passage would exacerbate the state's opioid epidemic. \n\nRoman Catholic bishops in Massachusetts also argued against legalization, saying it is \"not a path civil society should chose to take.\" \n\nThe Boston Globe wrote in support of the ballot measure, arguing, \"legal marijuana is coming. Let's get on with it.\" \n\nMaine\n\nIn Maine, a \"yes\" on Question 1 would make it legal for a person 21 or older to use marijuana.\n\nThe state would put a 10% sales tax on the drug and allow social clubs and retail groups to sell it.\n\nMaine legalized medical use of marijuana in 1999. Previous attempts to legalize it for recreational purposes have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe law would allow people to use it in a nonpublic space or in a private residence and institute a sales tax, with 98% of revenue from sales taxes going to a general fund. \n\nMaine's governor is against the legislation, calling it \"not just bad for Maine, it can be deadly.\" Supporters have raised more than $3.2 million to fight for it. The state's newspapers are divided on the issue.\n\nArizona\n\nThe battle for legalization in Arizona seems close, according to polls.\n\nMedical marijuana has been legal in the state since 1996. \n\nIf voters pass Proposition 205, it would be similar to other state laws up for consideration. People 21 or older could possess up to 1 ounce and grow up to six plants in their homes.\n\nThe law would also create a Department of Marijuana Licenses and Control that would regulate, test and oversee sales.\n\nPeople caught smoking it in public places would be fined, as would people who possessed more than the legal limit. \n\nA 15% sales tax would be deposited in a Marijuana Fund and distributed to the Department of Marijuana Licenses and Control and to the Department of Revenue. School districts and the state health department would also get a part of the money. \n\nNevada\n\nIn Nevada, a \"yes\" on Question 2 would make recreational use of 1 ounce or less legal or one-eighth of an ounce or less of concentrated marijuana legal for people age 21 and older. \n\nMedical marijuana was legalized in Nevada in 2000. \n\nThe law would allow stores, manufacturers and distributors to set up shop in the state. \n\nPeople could also grow six plants for personal use as long as it was in an enclosed area with a lock. The law would create fines for growing marijuana within public view. You could also get fined for smoking it in a public place or in a moving vehicle. \n\nNo marijuana businesses would be allowed to set up shop within 1,000 feet of a school and 500 feet of a community facility.\n\nNevada would put a 15% excise tax on it. The money would go to support schools and the regulation of the drug. \n\nA number of legislators and unions have voiced support for the measure. Conservative megadonor and casino owner Sheldon Adelson is against it. A number of legislators have voiced support for legalization, suggesting that it could bring additional tourist revenue to the state.

He, along with his wife and two children, has been moved at least 10 times -- although he says he's lost count -- in the past year.\n\nThe necessity for the constant moves originated with a change in his conscience, a slow transformation from around 2000 to 2013, when he says he realized that he was sowing chaos, murdering the poor and innocent, and serving evil.\n\nHe's been under witness protection and remains in hiding. He has an outstanding case against his former boss and the Philippines' current president, Rodrigo Duterte, who is under investigation by the country's Human Rights Commission. \n\nPhilippines President Duterte admits killing suspects\n\nWarrant pending\n\nThe government also has an arrest warrant out for him -- for not showing up in court on charges of possession of illegal firearms -- and has also charged him with a kidnapping in 2002.\n\nEven though he's claimed to have killed dozens of people, they wouldn't dare charge him with murder, he says, as that would be an admission of wrongdoing on the part of the Duterte administration. \n\nAfter decades in the employ of the Davao City government -- as an assassin, he says -- Matobato has now turned against his former paymaster. \n\nIn testimony to the Philippines Senate in September, Matobato said he was part of the Davao Death Squad (DDS), which he alleges was run on the orders of Duterte.\n\n\"Our work was to kill criminals like drug pushers, rapists, snatchers,\" he testified at the time. \"Those were the people we killed every day.\"\n\nCNN has not independently confirmed Matobato's allegations.\n\nDuterte's office denied the claims made by Matobato under oath, and said the President was \"unfazed\" by the Senate investigation.\n\nPhilippines scraps inquiry into alleged extrajudicial killings\n\nSecrecy at all costs\n\nWe are met on the road by his handlers some distance away from the compound, a necessary caution. He's in danger of being killed himself these days, as a key witness to -- and actor in -- what he says was a series of unspeakable crimes from 1988 to 2013. \n\nDuring that time he says he was part of the DDS, an allegedly state-sanctioned group of murderers who, alongside him, he says, killed as many as 1,400 people in the southern city under then-Mayor Duterte.\n\nAt first, he thought he was doing something just: ridding his town of bad people. But over the course of his career as a hit man he came to realize that he wasn't on the side of justice. In 2010, he says, he was ordered to kidnap and kill bodyguards and associates of one of Duterte's political rivals. Of the four bodies they dumped in the sea, two resurfaced.\n\nIt was one of the incidents that chipped away at an already dented conscience, leading to his recent claim that he was a killer for Duterte.\n\nAnother time, he recalls, three young women suspected of dealing shabu -- the local name for methamphetamine -- were bound, beaten and raped by DDS members, then killed. \n\nPhilippines President Rodrigo Duterte: What's he accused of?\n\nMarked for death\n\nHis former colleagues -- who numbered 300 at the height of the group's existence -- would kill him if they find him, he says matter-of-factly.\n\n\"I don't care anymore if they want to kill,\" he says. \"What I want to do now is to tell the truth and not to lie anymore.\"  \n\nHe wants to atone for the wrongs of his life in the DDS, and as a fervent Catholic, he says that he believes his God will forgive him, such is his genuine remorse. \n\nHe wears a sizable wooden cross outside his tight, white polo shirt and he says he is ready to face the judgment -- in this life or the next -- that his past demands.\n\nFor his part, Duterte has dismissed the 57-year-old as a liar and said he doesn't remember him, but Matobato tells CNN that he murdered around 50 people in a 24-year career as a hit man as part of the DDS; criminals and political rivals of the then-mayor in his hometown, the largest city in Mindanao in the country's restive south.\n\nDuterte's press secretary, Martin Andanar, says that the DDS is nothing but a myth.\n\n\"Everybody talks about the death squad,\" he tells CNN.\n\n\"There is the Philippines National Police. That's the authority. The death squad, the Davao Death Squad that people are talking about -- this is all legend. It's a legend. There is no death squad. There is the police and there is (the) AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines).\"\n\nKidnap, murder\n\nMatobato remembers it differently. Most often the DDS would kidnap their victims, he tells CNN, take them to a quiet part of town -- like a quarry -- and kill them before dismembering the bodies, dousing them in oil to keep them from smelling as they decomposed and burying them, or dumping them at sea, Matobato says.\n\nFor those disposed of at sea, they'd hack open their victims' chest cavities, to ensure that the corpses sank, he recalls. \n\nHe says that the orders mostly came from a ranking police officer, but on occasion, he says, Duterte himself would order the killings.\n\nIn 1993, after the bombing of the city's cathedral, Matobato says, Duterte personally told him and other DDS members, in the mayoral office, to go to a mosque and kill Muslims in reprisal for the terror attack. \n\nOn a different occasion, he alleges Duterte shot and killed a National Bureau of Investigation agent after a traffic altercation led to a shootout. The then-mayor emptied two full magazines of bullets into the agent, he said.\n\nAlleged Duterte hitman denied protection after tell-all testimony \n\nParallels with war on drugs \n\nIn the six months since Duterte took office as president, lurid images of extrajudicial killings crop up every morning in Filipino newspapers -- vigilante justice, or police operations known as \"buy busts\" that invariably end in the death of the alleged dealer.\n\nMatobato says they bear the hallmarks of those perpetrated by the DDS -- faces bound in electrical tape, crude cardboard signs around the victims' necks, proclaiming their alleged crimes.\n\nHe says DDS operatives would carry an extra, cheap pistol with them to dump near the bodies, claiming a shootout took place.\n\nAlmost all the police \"buy bust\" operations end with similar reports, and the morning papers' crime scene photos often feature handguns next to sprawled, bloodied bodies. Matobato says he's seen former DDS colleagues in Manila.\n\n\"Members of the DDS are already ... in Manila,\" he says. \"The policemen in Davao City are capable of killing... They don't have a soul, these members from Davao.\"\n\nShowdown at the top of Philippines politics: What you need to know\n\nKiller hired for a pittance\n\nOfficially a security official under the employ of City Hall, Matobato says that he and the other DDS members were rarely called upon to do their official duties -- \"such as securing the port\" -- but mostly were just used to carry out extrajudicial killings. He, and the others, were paid P5000 ($100) a month for their work, he told CNN.\n\nOthers had tried to get out, he says, but at least one former member was run over shortly after trying to escape the group's clutches.\n\nHe says that he begged to get away from the butchery, but in 2014 the kidnap and murder of a businessman was pinned on him. He insists he had nothing to do with it.\n\n\"They tortured me and kept me for a week. Every night they will torture me. My relatives helped me and I got out.\"\n\nHe told his wife of his grisly past and together with their two kids they fled the city and, later, went into the Human Rights Commission's witness protection program. Even though the HRC is an independent government agency, Matobato left its program when Duterte became president.\n\nAnd earlier this year, he took the witness stand to speak out about the group's bloody work.\n\nBut presidential spokesman Andanar says that the testimony of the self-declared former killer, who only has a first-grade education, is \"very inconsistent\" and not to be trusted. \n\n\"If you go through the transcript of the Senate you will see for yourself that Matobato is lying through his teeth,\" he says.\n\nAfter he first testified at the Senate inquiry into alleged extrajudicial killings, Matobato was placed under the protection of a private citizen.\n\nAnd now, a life interrupted; a series of furtive moves around the countryside, never knowing if he will suffer the same violent death he says he meted out so many times.\n\nHe wants his testimony to bring down the President, a man he says is no more than a bloody butcher who has carried over his brutal methods from Davao onto the national stage.\n\n\"(Duterte) should pay for all his sins. If the death penalty (is reinstated), I wish he will be the first to be hanged.\n\n\"Then I will follow. Yes, I am willing to follow.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.7663669586181605, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1424, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "HarmVice": 20, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.6889046717, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 55, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161230020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.8623595505618, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 5.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/us/muslim-nypd-officer-harassed-trnd/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 634, "scraper_regex": 692}}, "headline": "Muslim NYPD officer threatened, told 'go back to your country'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 692, "date": "20161205230000", "story_content": "New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he's \"sick to my stomach\" over an incident in which a Muslim off-duty NYPD officer was reportedly threatened over the weekend by a man who said, \"I will cut your throat, go back to your country.\"\n\nThe officer, Aml Elsokary, said she had just dropped off her 16-year-old son in Brooklyn Saturday evening when a man begin arguing with the teen.

Nelson was ordered held on $50,000 bail, according to Acting Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez.\n\nNelson's attorney did not immediately respond to a request from CNN seeking comment.\n\nThere are approximately 900 Muslim-Americans currently serving on the NYPD, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday at a news conference in which he addressed the threat against Elsokary. \n\n\"This is her country, she is an American, she is a New Yorker, and this is her home. We cannot allow this hatred and bias to spread,\" de Blasio said. \n\nOfficer Aml Elsokary -- one of 900 Muslim-Americans in the NYPD -- was attacked because of her faith.

I'm born and raised here and I am here to protect you all. The department has supported me in wearing my hijab. I want to thank my Muslim officers for standing by my side,\" Elsokary said at Monday's press conference.  \n\n\"It's unacceptable that Officer Aml Elsokary or anybody be treated with bigotry,\" @NYCMayor now.

The man allegedly called the uniformed employee a \"terrorist\" and pushed her down a flight of stairs.  \n\nThe transit employee sustained injuries to her ankle and knee and was transported to an area hospital, according to a statement from Governor Andrew Cuomo, who directed the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the State Police and the state Division of Human Rights to investigate the matter.  \n\n\"This is the great state of New York -- we welcome people of all cultures, customs and creeds with open arms. We do not allow intolerance or fear to divide us because we know diversity is our strength and we are at our best when we stand united,\" Cuomo said. \n\nHate crimes in New York City are up 35% from last year, with a \"huge spike\" in incidents right after Election Day on November 8, NYPD Chief of Detectives Bob Boyce said Monday. Most of the reported hate crimes have been anti-Semitic in nature, followed by anti-Muslim crimes, Boyce said. \n\nDe Blasio said the uptick in hate crimes were \"obviously connected to the (presidential) election.\" \n\nCritics accused President-elect Donald Trump of fostering xenophobia and Islamophobia during the divisive presidential campaign. In an interview last month Trump said he was \"so saddened\" to hear about vitriol hurled by some of his supporters against minorities and told them to \"stop it.\"\n\n\"You can't have a candidate for president single out groups of Americans negatively and not have some ramification for that, not have something as a result of that. It's very troubling. Look, a few times recently the President-elect has spoken out against it. He needs to keep doing that,\" de Blasio said Monday.

It recruited only several hundred foreign fighters this year, compared with a couple thousand a month last year, CNN has learned.  \n\nIn addition, the official also revealed Thursday that in May 2015, US special operations forces came \"tantalizingly close\" to capturing or killing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi in Raqqa, but failed to do so because classified information was leaked to the news media.\n\nThe official briefed reporters at the Pentagon on the condition his name not be used due to the sensitivity of the information. \n\nThe official noted that after the May 2015 raid in Syria that killed ISIS operative Abu Sayyaf and led to the capture of his wife, the US got valuable information on Baghdadi from the wife after two days of interrogation.\n\nAt the time, she told them \"last week we were with Al Baghdadi in Raqqa,\" the official said. \"We had been tracking them in Raqqa, so we went back frantically to try to figure out where he (Baghdadi) was in Raqqa.\"\n\nBut the official said communications that were being monitored dried up which the official blamed news stories that were published about intelligence learned from the raid.\n\nThe senior military official also disclosed that earlier this week when President Barack Obama visited the US military in Florida he privately spoke about the incoming Trump administration to General Joseph Votel, head of US Central Command, and General Tony Thomas, head of US Special Operations Command.\n\n\"He asked specifically are there things we could be doing as an administration\" to assist a smooth transition on military issues such as fighting ISIS and counterterrorism, the official said. The official would not discuss Votel's answer but broadly noted that Thomas spoke about some changes to how special operations interact with the rest of the government. \n\nThe bulk of the meeting with reporters dealt with the issue of special operations taking a leading role in coordinating across the entire US government efforts to counter extremist threats against the US and coalition partners originating from overseas.\n\nThe matter has caused bureaucratic headaches inside the Pentagon and Congress over the question of whether special operations forces like Delta Force and Navy Seals will operate overseas more than they already do. The official insisted special operations have no new authorities to operate. But special operations forces will set up a new center to coordinate their operations with coalition forces and other government agencies at an \"undisclosed location,\" the official said.\n\nThe official revealed for the last 18 months there has been a US military policy that airstrikes are only allowed against targets where 10 or less civilians might be killed.\n\nIn a related matter, special operations is also set to become the leading part of the military for \"countering weapons of mass destruction,\" taking that role over from the US Strategic Command.\n\nThere is growing concern that North Korea is edging closer to being able to deploy a nuclear weapon. The official said the US believes it has the capability to mate a nuclear warhead, missile and delivery system.\n\n\"It's the threat that keeps me awake at night,\" the official said. The only issue holding the North Koreans off at this point appears to be they have not mastered the technology to make a weapon re-enter the earth's atmosphere to reach its target. All of this is leading to stepped up \"contingency planning,\" to deal with North Korea's nuclear capability if it came to that, the official said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.2841091156005902, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 592, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.56163687338, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.36486486486486, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/13/entertainment/k2s0-alan-tudyk-interview-rogue-one-star-wars/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 891, "scraper_regex": 987}}, "headline": "Alan Tudyk on 'Rogue One,' R2 vs. C-3PO and why K-2SO has an English accent", "wordcount_as_scraped": 987, "date": "20161213220000", "story_content": "\"Star Wars\" has introduced some of the most beloved characters in movie history, and a lot of them weren't even human. \n\nLovable robots (or droids, if we're being specific) like R2-D2, C-3PO and BB-8 have stood out in the space saga. Now, with \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" hitting theaters this weekend, a new hardwired hero, K-2SO, may make a mark of its own.\n\nA reprogrammed Imperial droid now on the right side of the rebellion, K-2SO is played by Alan Tudyk, who has portrayed a robot before in 2004's \"I, Robot.\" CNN spoke with Tudyk at New York's Comic Con in October to find out what makes K-2SO different from the droids that preceded him, and what playing him was like. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nCan you tell me a little bit about what your character is like?\n\nK-2SO is a droid... He used to be with the Empire, which is a little different, and now he is with the Rebel Alliance. Cassian, played by Diego Luna, he's the one who reprogrammed my character from being an Empire robot and he left a couple of wires sort of not connected. K-2SO has an honesty in situations that is at times not as appreciated as you might expect, but can be funny to watch and entertaining anyway.\n\nThis is the not the first time you've played a robot. You were also Sonny in \"I, Robot.\" As an actor, how is it different playing a robot than a real person?\n\nEach one has their own challenge. Sonny, in \"I, Robot,\" he was the one robot that was having emotions and a personality and that's freaking everybody out. In \"Star Wars,\" the history of the droids is that they have personalities built in, so that wasn't the journey of the role... This is a droid who's been in the world, who has a lot of knowledge and can access it, and people react to him as a person, really, just one who has special abilities because he's also a machine.\n\nThe Star Wars prequels haven't exactly been well-loved. How can \"Rogue One\" create a prequel that fans are actually going to be really into?\n\nWell we have those as a reference, the beginning three, to go, \"Maybe... No Jar Jar Binks.\" That's the important thing... Actually, if you go to Lucasfilm in San Francisco, they've got Jar Jar Binks encased in carbonite. I don't think they're letting him out.\n\nHe was an animated character. They just animated and said, \"This is how he's going to move.\" He moves like a cartoon. K-2SO, my character, and other characters are motion capture. They have a real quality to them that they missed there. They've made that change. \n\n[And] this movie's different from all the other movies, even \"A New Hope\" and the ones that come after it, because it's grittier. It's a bunch of people going to steal these plans and it's almost like a war movie.\n\nCan you talk to me about your process as an actor doing motion capture?\n\nFor K-2, he was on stilts. That was sort of the first hurdle, \"OK, just so you know you're going to be on stilts that are about a foot high, or a little over.\" There's a little process of adjustment. Running on sand was hard. Certain just physical challenges. Going down ramps of space ships, that took its own learning adjustment. \n\nI had arms that we would put on at times that were really long. He's got these big gangling arms and they work like puppets. Because it's [visual effects company] Industrial Light & Magic who does all of this stuff, it's the top of the line. All of the creatures that they make. They made robot hands.\n\nRobot hands?\n\n...They made them out of a special alloy so they wouldn't be too heavy. When I did my fingers like this, its fingers did that. It was amazing.\n\nRelated: 'Rogue One' dazzles as it expands 'Star Wars' universe\n\nIn the long history of \"Star Wars\" you've had beloved robot characters like R2-D2, C-3PO and BB-8. Do you feel that fans will appreciate your character... even though it is motion capture?\n\nI think so because, you know, he looks like he's in the room. The digital animation that they're able to do now is so advanced, even from when we did \"I, Robot,\" they make it look like he's actually there... They're able to match a little bit more of my expression than C-3PO, [who] had a fixed stare and a rectangle mouth, which is a huge testament to his characterization that so much of that personality comes out just with voice and very stiff movements. I have a little bit more fluidity and the ability to show emotion through movement.\n\nHow did you come up with the voice? Was there anything that you based it on?\n\nHe has an English accent that is a bit proper because he was a robot who was programmed by the Empire. The Empire tends to be evil with an English accent, for some reason. The rebels had American accents so he has an English accent. That was sort of the way in and then the character as he's written and as he behaves in situations affected him, effected the way he spoke as well. Just like any character.\n\nSo are you a R2-D2 or a C-3PO man?\n\nR2 was cool. I like them both. It's tough to take sides.\n\nYou're an R2 man. You don't have to be nice to C-3PO. No one likes him.\n\nWhat! That's not true... I know of several people who like him, including Anthony Daniels [the actor who played C-3PO], who really likes him.\n\nWell, yeah. He's a little biased.\n\nHe is, but you know, even BB-8. I liked BB-8 before he was in [\"The Force Awakens.\"] He was in \"Cast Away,\" as Wilson.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.676328480243683, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 891, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 10, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.11753239991, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.35690235690236, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/opinions/chattanooga-bus-crash-charges-cevallos-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "What Tennessee laws say about bus crash", "wordcount_as_scraped": 664, "date": "20161123190000", "story_content": "Following a tragic crash in Tennessee, bus driver Johnthony Walker has been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving.\n\nAs the eyes of the nation watch this story unfold, it's important to take note of how Tennessee's laws may determine Walker's fate.\n\nVehicular homicide in Tennessee is reckless killing while driving an automobile, resulting from conduct creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to a person. It's a Class C felony, carrying a sentence of three to 15 years. However, if a defendant has prior convictions for driving under the influence or vehicular assault, or has a blood-alcohol reading of .20%, the crime may be aggravated to a class A felony, which ups the potential sentence to a minimum of 15 years, and a maximum of 60 years. \n\nWalker has also been charged with reckless endangerment, which is reckless conduct that places or may place another in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury. When committed with a deadly weapon, such as a bus, reckless endangerment is a Class E felony, which carries a sentence of one to six years. \n\nIf convicted, any defendant from any state has to worry about whether he will receive consecutive or concurrent sentences. Concurrent means all sentences run at once. Consecutive means a defendant only serves one sentence at a time. In Tennessee, a judge may order sentences to run consecutively only if certain criteria are met, e.g., the defendant behaved with no regard for human life. As you can imagine, defendants universally prefer concurrent sentencing.\n\nThe point is Walker could have a potential sentencing range of three years ... to practically forever. \n\nFor many, if he were deliberately speeding, and that reprehensible conduct killed five children, no sentence will be too long.\n\nAnd yet nearly every driver engages in that same reprehensible conduct every day. We're all horrible drivers. We're worse than ever. We're speeding, we're texting, and we're crashing.  \n\nOf course, there's a good reason we expect bus drivers to be different from the rest of us: They are driving kids. But we should also be aware that parents are out there too, speeding and driving recklessly with their own precious cargo in the back seat.  \n\nSpeeding is an amorphous offense under the law. Technically, going 1 mph over the speed limit is a violation, but you'd have a hard time finding anyone convicted of going 1 mile over the limit, or finding someone who thinks going 46 mph in a 45-mph zone is morally wrong. Going 50 mph over the speed limit is a different story. Speeding occupies a broad moral and criminal spectrum, and we've all been guilty of it at one point or another.\n\nYou might be saying: \"Bus drivers drive our children. They should be held to the highest standard of care.\" \n\nExcept they're not. At least not in Tennessee.  \n\n\"Common carriers,\" such as train drivers and airplane pilots, are in the business of moving other people around. Traditionally, a common carrier must exercise the \"highest practical degree of care\" in transporting humans. \n\nIn Tennessee, school buses -- in fact, school systems in general -- do not have the same duty of care as a common carrier, according to that state's Supreme Court.  \n\nA school bus driver in the Volunteer State is only obligated \"to exercise reasonable and ordinary care under the circumstances.\" The Tennessee high court has also said that when a school bus is transporting young children, the driver must \"exercise special care proportionate to the age of the child and its ability, or lack of ability, to care for itself.\"  \n\nCrashes can kill or maim any student, irrespective of the student's age or ability. \n\nThe point is, you may think that bus drivers such as Johnthony Walker should be held to the highest duty of care for all children, no matter their age or abilities. It's an understandable sentiment. The problem is that Tennessee's Supreme Court -- and the law -- completely disagrees with you.

It led to a new sentencing law, a hard alcohol ban at Stanford and an effort to remove Persky from the bench through a recall election.\n\nThe Commission on Judicial Performance, an independent state agency, reviewed thousands of complaints to determine if Persky's actions amounted to judicial misconduct. The investigation could have led to sanctions or dismissal but it had no bearing on the sentence.\n\n\"The commission has concluded that there is not clear and convincing evidence of bias, abuse of authority, or other basis to conclude that Judge Persky engaged in judicial misconduct warranting discipline,\" the commission said. \n\n\"Accordingly, the participating commission members voted unanimously to close, without discipline, its preliminary investigation of the complaints against the judge regarding his sentencing decision in the Turner case.\"\n\nThe complaints against Persky focused on five themes, the commission said:\n\n\u2022 Persky abused his authority and displayed bias in his sentencing. \n\n\u2022 The sentence was unlawful.\n\n\u2022 Persky's sentence displayed gender bias and failed to take sexual assault of women seriously.\n\n\u2022 Persky exhibited racial and/or socioeconomic bias because a nonwhite or less privileged defendant would have received a harsher sentence.\n\n\u2022 The judge's history as a student athlete at Stanford University caused him to be biased in favor of Turner and he should have disclosed his Stanford affiliation.\n\nHowever, the commission concluded the sentence was within the parameters set by law. Additionally, Persky followed the recommendation of the probation report and performed a balancing assessment of accounts from the victim and the defendant, the commission said. \n\nPersky read the assessment aloud at the sentencing hearing. He noted that Turner's age, 18 at the time of the assault, and lack of criminal record weighed in favor of probation over prison. The panel agreed, pointing out that under state law a judge is required to consider such factors when determining if prison or probation is appropriate.\n\nPersky was criticized for suggesting that Turner's level of intoxication served as a mitigating factor. The commission said that question had greater bearing on the sentence itself and would be better addressed on appeal. Otherwise, Persky's reliance on that factor did not rise to the level of judicial misconduct because it did not clearly show abuse of authority or disregard of the law or for fundamental human rights.\n\nMembers of the public pointed to sentencing outcomes in other cases Persky handled as evidence of a pattern of bias. The commission said those cases did not support a finding of bias, either because Persky was not involved in the sentencing, or because the outcome came from a plea deal or the probation department's recommendation. \n\nFinally, the commission said Persky's association with Stanford University was insufficient to require disclosure or disqualification.\n\nThe brevity of the sentence triggered outrage against Persky and conversation about how the justice system treats sexual assault survivors. \n\nTurner was released in September after serving three months under a state law intended to reduce overcrowding. He also must register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. \n\nA target for much of the outrage, Persky recused himself from a child pornography case and stepped down from the criminal court in September. The campaign to recall him continues.\n\n\"We will continue to proceed with the recall election as it is important for Santa Clara County voters to decide whether Judge Persky should remain on the bench,\" Michele Dauber, chairwoman of the Recall Persky Campaign, said in a statement.\n\nShe disputed the commission's finding that Persky followed a probation recommendation in some cases. Otherwise, she said the decision shows that a recall election will be the most effective means of seeking Persky's removal.\n\n\"We strongly disagree with the commission's conclusion on judicial bias and we believe that Judge Persky has in fact demonstrated a clear pattern of bias in cases of sex crimes and violence against women,\" Daubert said. \n\n\"Under the California Constitution, Judge Persky is an elected official and voters have the right to decide whether he should continue to serve on the bench for the next six years.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.4503312110900906, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 563, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.42330370614, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161219220000, "FairnessVice": 8, "pct_mft_words": 6.03907637655417, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/13/us/cancer-dying-man-wedding-texas-trnd/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 524, "scraper_regex": 571}}, "headline": "Man weds fiancee hours before succumbing to cancer", "wordcount_as_scraped": 571, "date": "20161214030000", "story_content": "On Friday, when the hospital chaplain asked Raul Hinojosa for his final wish, the cancer-wracked patient just said, \"I want to marry her.\"\n\nHis longtime fiancee, Yvonne Lamas, told CNN, \"I looked around the room, and said 'Who?'

When they arrived, the judge waived the typical 72-hour waiting period, Lamas said. \n\nThe director of the critical care unit -- who never wears a coat and tie to work, but had that morning after going to see his daughter's Christmas program at school -- shed his suit and gave it to Raul to wear for the ceremony, she said. \n\nCooks in the hospital's cafeteria baked a wedding cake, and relatives ran out to get a dress for Lamas. \n\n\"It was a perfect fit,\" said Angie Paiz, Raul's aunt. \n\nAfter Hinojosa was admitted to a critical care unit in Amarillo, Texas, in late October, Lamas had spent every day at his side, balancing his needs with the needs of their children at home.\n\nHinojosa and Lamas had been together for 11 years. \"He was very respectful, very romantic and always wanted to give me the world,\" Lamas said. \"He knew how to put a smile on my face no matter the situation.\" \n\nThey have a son who is 9, and Lamas has three daughters from a previous marriage, but Hinojosa took them in as if they were his own. \n\n\"As a father figure he was very loving, very caring to my kids,\" Lamas said. \"He gave them the world and was there for them when times were tough.\"\n\n\"He was a good person. He was a giving person,\" Paiz told CNN. He worked hard to provide for his family, picking up odd jobs even after he got sick because he couldn't keep a steady one. \n\nHinojosa proposed in 2007, but he and Lamas had been waiting to marry.\n\n\"He was determined to give me the best fairytale wedding,\" Lamas said. \"He tried saving up, but within that time he ended up getting diagnosed with the leukemia.\" \n\nHospital bills stacked up, and it started to look as if their dreams would never be realized.\n\nBut within a couple of hours, thanks to the collective effort of family and the hospital staff, the wedding was ready. \n\nNursing staff lined up outside the hospital room, and Lamas was escorted down the makeshift aisle by her father. \n\n\"When I walked down the aisle and saw him in the suit, he just took my breath away,\" Lamas said. \"He was so handsome. It was priceless.\"\n\nHer father delicately placed Lamas' hand in Hinojosa's, and the chaplain choked back tears as she recounted their story. \"When this illness was diagnosed,\" she said, \"Yvonne promised she would never leave him. She would be with him. They would do this together.\" \n\nWith his wife-to-be on his left and his son on his right, Hinojosa recited his vows. \n\nWith their children, family and friends gathered around them, Hinojosa and Lamas were finally married. \n\nHinojosa, 33, died of leukemia on Saturday, just 36 hours later. \n\nWhen she signed her husband's death certificate, it was the first time Lamas had signed her married name.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.53846156597137, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 524, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.18938083251, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.05343511450382, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-resistance/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1136, "scraper_regex": 1291}}, "headline": "Resistance to Trump's travel ban mounts", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1291, "date": "20170130120000", "story_content": "President Donald Trump enters the second week of his presidency facing a growing political backlash -- with protesters in the streets, lawsuits mounting and his own party fracturing over his executive order banning travel to the United States from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nThe resistance is offering an early and immediate preview of the dynamics of the Trump presidency: It tests the opposition's strength and durability, the White House's crisis management capabilities and Capitol Hill Republicans' willingness to stomach the controversy that accompanies Trump's efforts to fulfill his campaign promises. \n\nMeanwhile, stories of students, public figures and even a military translator who are suddenly unclear on whether they can enter the United States are setting social media ablaze. \n\nIt all comes as the nascent Trump administration enters a critical period, with Trump still seeking Senate confirmation for most of his Cabinet nominees. \n\nThe White House is scrambling to tamp down the controversy, with Trump addressing it in a statement and taking a warning shot at critical Republicans. And his administration is considering moving up the announcement of his first Supreme Court appointment from Thursday to possibly Tuesday, potentially in an effort to change the subject, one source told CNN.\n\nTrump on defense\n\nTrump released a statement defending his ban Sunday evening, while also lashing out at two Republican senators who had opposed it and the news media over its coverage of the ban. \n\n\"America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say,\" Trump said in the statement. \n\nHe continued: \"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion -- this is about terror and keeping our country safe.\" \n\nRepublican backlash\n\nIn a joint statement, Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham earlier Sunday had called Trump's travel ban a \"self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\" \n\n\"This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security,\" the two said. \n\nTrump lambasted McCain and Graham together in a two-tweet response, writing: \"The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The two Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.\" \n\nThe joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The two...\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017\n\n...Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017\n\nBut even as Trump hit McCain and Graham, other Republicans were similarly criticizing his executive order. \n\nRep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, called it \"the ultimate display of mistrust.\" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, said the order \"has been poorly implemented, especially with respect to green card holders.\" \n\n\"This was an extreme vetting program that wasn't properly vetted,\" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nLegal battles mount\n\nAlready, a federal judge in New York blocked part of Trump's executive order on immigration, ruling that authorities could not remove individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries who had arrived in US airports after the order had been issued. Other judges had ruled against the order, as well. \n\nSixteen Democratic state attorneys general issued a joint statement calling Trump's move \"unconstitutional, un-American and unlawful\" and vowing to fight it in court. \n\nThe controversy comes the week Trump has said he will announce his choice for a vacancy on the Supreme Court. \n\nDemocratic House and Senate leaders have planned a protest outside the Supreme Court for 6 p.m. ET Monday. \n\nThe chaotic scenes around airports Saturday came in part because Trump's administration had reportedly not allowed career Homeland Security Department staff to see the executive order. \n\nOne key question for many is how the order will affect US green card holders and people who hold dual citizenship with a Trump approved country and one of the seven banned nations.\n\nAdding to the confusion, Trump administration officials seemed to at times contradict themselves during appearances on Sunday news shows. In mere minutes during an interview with NBC, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said the order \"doesn't affect\" green card holders, then later said \"of course\" it affects green card holders from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia -- the seven countries Trump has temporarily stop immigration from for 90 days. \n\nLater Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a statement that sought to clarify their status saying, \"lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.\"\n\nAnother Homeland Security official told CNN the green card holders who are returning to the US will still go through additional screening and national security checks upon landing. However, the government is trying to ease their entry back into the US. Unless they have a significant criminal history or links to terrorism, they will be allowed back in the country after going the check the official said.\n\n\"This is our message to them: get on a plane. Come back to the US. You will be subject to secondary screening, but everything else will be normal,\" the Homeland Security official told CNN.\n\nProtests fill airports nationwide\n\nHordes of protesters gathered at airports across the United States, carrying signs, welcoming international arrivals and chanting anti-Trump slogans. \n\nIn the second weekend of Trump's presidency, it was the second weekend in a row of mass protests -- following on the heels of anti-Trump women's marches in Washington and cities around the world. \n\nAnd the protests extended beyond airports. Throngs of people were gathering Sunday afternoon outside the White House. Crowds also were forming in Boston's Copley Square, at Battery Park in Manhattan and at airports in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Washington and Dallas, with more planned elsewhere.\n\nTop Democratic officials were involved in the protests, too. \n\nIn San Francisco, Democratic National Committee chair candidate Tom Perez was on Facebook livestreaming his participation in protests there. \n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only.\n\nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters.\n\n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio posted a series of tweets calling the travel ban \"shameful\" and \"simply un-American.\" He later tweeted a photo of protesters Sunday at New York's Battery Park, saying: \"There is something more important and powerful than all three branches of government. It is you -- the people. #BatteryPark.\"\n\nThere is something more important and powerful than all three branches of government. It is you -- the people. #BatteryPark pic.twitter.com/FXVHlahxHB\u2014 Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) January 29, 2017\n\nChelsea Clinton even got in on the act, tweeting a picture of protesters in New York: \"Yes.

But it was Russia's officials who tweeted some of the most celebratory messages, with one senator calling the day \"a defining moment in history.\"  \n\nHere is some of the reaction from around the world, from opposition to support -- and even indifference:\n\nBelgium\n\nA Women's March in Brussels elicited criticism of Trump's offensive comments about women and alleged cases of sexual harassment. The demonstration drew participants from a range of countries, including Norway and Spain.\n\nKatrine Steinfeld, a Norwegian-Hungarian who works for gender equality in Brussels, said she fears that Trump's election will legitimize the ill treatment of women.\n\n\"It's crazy that this man can lead a country and assault women,\" Steinfeld said.\n\n\"His behavior creates legitimacy for attitudes that is not appropriate and that is a threat for women,\" she added.\n\nRebecca, who did not give her last name, was critical of Trump, but expressed cautiously optimism.\n\n\"I came because I don't want Trump to be the new normal,\" said Rebecca, a Spaniard residing in Brussels. \"It's a threat for moral and human rights. I'm not against him. I'm against what he says.\"\n\n\"We need to watch and see what he will do,\" she added. \"I give him credit and I will wait and see, but I fear it would be bad.\"\n\nCuba\n\nCuba's state media paid little attention to Trump's inauguration, perhaps wary of his promises to take a harder line on the communist-run island, CNN's Patrick Oppmann reports. \n\nGranma, the official communist party newspaper, ran articles Friday on birth statistics, the end of the baseball season and a new, experimental strain of cigar tobacco, but made no mention of Trump's swearing-in. \n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump pledged to reverse Obama's historic opening with Cuba if Havana didn't make concessions on human rights and religious freedom. Privately, Cuban officials have said they are waiting to see if Trump's action will match his rhetoric and so far have avoided criticizing him.\n\nChina\n\nA wary China watched one of its toughest critics assume the presidency Friday, marking the start of what could be a more contentious bilateral relationship between the world's two largest economies.  \n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Friday before Trump was sworn in. Chunying emphasized constructive bilateral relations between the two countries to \"propel further development of China-US ties at a new staring point.\"\n\n\"We would like to join hands with the new US administration to uphold the principles of non-confrontation, non-conflict, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,\" Chunying said.\n\nDuring his inauguration address, Trump took a populist tone, saying, \"We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.\"  \n\nThough he didn't mention China by name, he has vowed to be tougher on the country by renegotiating trade agreements and has even proposed imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. \n\nState-run communist media did not shy away from criticizing Trump last year, calling the then-candidate a \"clown\" and \"big-mouthed.\" But tabloid-style newspaper Global Times wrote in a Friday editorial, \"A favorable Sino-US relationship represents great progress in human political civilization, and it is hoped that Trump will consolidate this trend.\"\n\nIndia\n\nTrump received a warm congratulations from India's prime minister and minister for information and broadcasting.\n\nLooking forward to working with President @realDonaldTrump to further deepen India-US ties & realise the full potential of our cooperation.\u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) January 20, 2017\n\n\"Looking forward to working with President @realDonaldTrump to further deepen India-US ties & realise the full potential of our cooperation,\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted. \n\nCongratulations president @realDonaldTrump!

Looking forward to enhanced Indo US ties. The two are natural allies in fight against terrorism,\" Minister for Information Rajyavardhan Rathore tweeted.\n\nIran\n\nThere was little love for Trump at the Grand Mosalla, a complex of religious halls and other facilities in Tehran, as people gathered for their usual fiery Friday prayers, CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports. Instead, they ripped the US for its policies toward Iran and its role in Syria.\n\n\"It makes no difference which president is in power,\" a young man wearing a scarf depicting Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told CNN. \"Whoever is in power will have that same outlook on Iran, which is a pity.\"\n\nThe main topic on the minds of many of those in attendance was the future of the nuclear agreement between Iran, the US and other nations, aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for sanctions relief. \n\nTrump has called the agreement a bad deal, and said he wants to renegotiate it. Iran's government has rejected that idea, and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has insisted that one man cannot repeal the deal or change its terms.\n\nIsrael\n\nEven before Trump's inauguration, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent him a welcome tweet.\n\n\"Congrats to my friend President Trump. Look fwd to working closely with you to make the alliance between Israel&USA stronger than ever.\" \n\nCongrats to my friend President Trump.

The event was organized by the group Democrats Abroad of Japan.\n\n\"I just want to make sure that Trump knows that we are here,\" event organizer Erica Summers said. \"Women are not going anywhere. I want to make sure we have our reproductive rights. I want him to know we (women) are equal, and he cannot get rid of us.\"\n\nAbout 550 miles to the southwest, a few hours before the inauguration, a few dozen Japanese conservatives enjoyed a celebration of the new American president at a restaurant in the city of Fukuoka.\n\nSince the swearing-in would be happening too late for their gathering, diners watched Election Night footage on a big screen.\n\n\"Trump is such an honest, outspoken person who has the same way of political thinking as us,\" event organizer Yoko Mada said.\n\n\"What conservatives in Japan have been wanting is to bring this nation out of the so-called post-war regime, and one symbolic thing would be us owning our own military again, which Trump supports.\"\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday extended his \"heartfelt congratulations\" to Trump.\n\nIn a letter, Abe reflected on their November \"candid exchange of views\" at Trump's home in New York. \n\n\"I look forward to working hands in hands with you to ensure peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and to address various challenges the international community faces,\" Abe said.\n\nMexico\n\nPresident Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto tweeted nearly two hours after Trump's address, congratulating the new leader and expressing a desire to strengthen the relationship between the countries.\n\nFormer President Vicente Fox wasn't nearly as gracious. An outspoken critic of Trump's pledge to have Mexico pay for a border wall, the former head of state kept up his long-running taunting of Trump.\n\nDuring Trump's address, Fox tweeted: \"Speaking of allegiance, Trump? Speaking of greatness? America was already great and succesful, then you happened!\"\n\nSpeaking of allegiance, Trump? Speaking of greatness? Speaking of success? America was already great and succesful, then you happened!\u2014 Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) January 20, 2017\n\nAnd: \"Prosperity comes in compassion and friendship. We will thrive, we will be succesful. Let the US lock themselves up!\"\n\nEarlier in the morning, Fox tweeted this: \"Today we turn into an era of uncertainty. If Donald the Unready doesn't learn to behave, the rest of the world needs to come together.\"\n\nToday we turn into an era of uncertainty. If Donald the Unready doesn't learn to behave, the rest of the world needs to come together.\u2014 Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) January 20, 2017\n\nMexican Sen. Armando Rios Piter had some choice words for Trump: \"Happiness is a good thing to work on and Mexico and the United States should be working in that way -- not in the way that Donald Trump has been talking.\"\n\nTrump's address did little to calm tensions or improve his reputation among protesters in Mexico City. The roundabout marked by Mexico's Angel of Independence was surrounded by protesters calling Trump a fascist, racist and xenophobe. Carrying signs that said \"Make America human again\" and \"Love trumps hate,\" protesters chanted \"Get out Trump.\"\n\nJuan Carlos Guerrero wore a souvenir T-shirt from Barack Obama's first presidential inauguration and asked two things of Trump: respect and a change in tone on NAFTA, the free-trade agreement Trump has threatened to eliminate to keep US jobs from moving to Mexico.\n\nMarquis Staples traveled to Mexico City from Wisconsin to make sure Mexicans know there is opposition to Trump in the United States. Holding a sign that read \"F*ck Trump,\" Staples said Mexicans appreciated his presence, giving him thumbs up, high fives and honking their horns at his sign.\n\nPalestinians\n\nPalestinian leaders offered few -- if any -- statements after the inauguration, but their primary concern echoed the mood on the streets. \n\nThursday, thousands of Palestinians demonstrated across the West Bank, protesting the potential move of the US Embassy to Jerusalem. Demonstrators held up pictures of Trump and waved Palestinian flags. \n\nPhilippines\n\nWell before dawn in the United States, about 200 people marched Friday against Trump in the Philippines' capital, Manila, Reuters reported.\n\nDemonstrators burned a mock, paper US flag before lighting an actual one. Chants included: \"US troops out now!\"\n\n\"Filipinos from Manila to Washington to New York are joining protest actions against what they believe to be ... a fascist and racist regime, and now the chief representative of US imperialism,\" Renato Reyes Jr., secretary-general of the Philippines' left-wing New Patriotic Alliance, told Reuters. \n\nSome protesters carried signs labeled Bayan Muna, the leftist alliance's political party.\n\nPeople also held signs with messages such as \"Donald Trump, pullout US troops in the PH!\" and \"Fight Trump. Resist fascism and imperialism.\" \n\nRussia\n\nLate Friday, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a Facebook post: \"In a world of many things can happen, except one: President Obama can't say anything anymore about Russia.\"\n\nThis follows a series of tweets from Alexei Pushkov, an outspoken Russian senator and former chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Relations Committee.  \n\nPushkov's tweets seems to pave the way for \"improved\" Russia-US relations.\n\n\"\u0410fter Mr.Trump inauguration his meeting with President Putin will be the most important event in world politics.

He'll need Russia.\"\n\nSouth Korea \n\nHours before the inauguration, acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn sent a letter of congratulations to Trump. Kyo-ahn highlighted the importance of the South Korea-U.S. alliance and urged close cooperation in countering North Korean nuclear threats. \n\nMeanwhile, the country's semi-official Yonhap news agency called Trump's speech \"strongly negative\" toward America's security commitments overseas despite a promise to \"reinforce all the alliances.\"\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe new American president drew a message of congratulations from the UK's foreign minister around the time of the inauguration speech.\n\nCongratulations to @realDonaldTrump @POTUS on his presidential inauguration day. Look forward to continuing strong UK - US bond\u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) January 20, 2017\n\n\"Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump @POTUS on his presidential inauguration day. Look forward to continuing strong UK - US bond,\" Boris Johnson tweeted.\n\nEarlier in the day, a UK-based protest group used signs and bridges across the country to convey a less celebratory message.\n\nThe group unfurled an 80-foot banner reading \"Bridges Not Walls\" on the iconic Tower Bridge over London's River Thames on Friday morning -- one of more than 150 such strips that the group planned to display on bridges across the country.\n\nSimilar banners or signs were displayed on some of London's other spans, including Waterloo Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge.\n\nThe group, Bridges Not Walls, said it was showing support for people it believes stand to be marginalized under a Trump administration.\n\n\"On Trump's inauguration day we're taking action to show our support for groups under attack -- here in the UK, across Europe and in the USA -- and to reject the rise of a dangerous and divisive far right politics,\" a message from representative Nona Hurkmans says on the group's website.\n\nMeanwhile, drinks flowed as some Republican US expatriates and like-minded Brits cheered Trump at an inauguration viewing party at the Royal Overseas League in central London, organized by Republicans Overseas UK.\n\n\"It gives me great confidence in our democracy,\" the group's chair, Malise Sundstrom, said. \"I think in my lifetime I won't see a transition of power like this.

The duet features a man trying to dissuade a woman from leaving a party despite her repeated protestations that she has to go home. \"What's in this drink?\" is one of the female lines. \"What's the sense in hurtin' my pride?\" implores the male voice.\n\nThe song's seeming disregard for the woman's desire to leave never sat well with Lemanski or Liza.\n\n\"I've always had a big problem with the song. It's so aggressive and inappropriate,\" said Lemanski, 25.\n\nLiza, 22, said she felt the same way as her boyfriend.\n\n\"We started thinking of the open-ended questions that song has,\" she said. \"You never figure out if she gets to go home. You never figure out if there was something in her drink. It just leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.\"\n\nSo Wednesday night, the couple decided to write a complete set of new lyrics.\n\n\"We wrote the whole thing in an hour and then we went back and used my little demo-recording microphone and did that in 15 minutes,\" Liza recalled.\n\nAnd though the melody is still the same, the lyrics strike an entirely new chord. \n\n\" I really can't stay/Baby I'm fine with that\" opens the song, as the lyrics recall the original's format of a woman leaving a party. Except in Liza and Lemanski's version, she does so without protest, the man helps her get home safely and the fictional couple makes a date the next day at The Cheesecake Factory.\n\n\"I ought to say no, no, no,\" sings Liza.\n\n\"You reserve the right to say no,\" croons Lemanski.\n\nAnd as for that dubious \"What's in this drink?\" line. It's still there. Except, in the new version, the question is actually answered -- by Lemanski, who responds with the oh-so-now \"\"Pomegranate La Croix\" (obviously).\n\n\"I thought we were just doing like a really good, cool, funny thing and it just felt right,\" Liza said.\n\n\"And emphasizing consent is one of the causes that I've always really been behind because I don't think I can think of one friend of mine who's a woman who hasn't been in dangerous situations with men. I've always cared about this so much,\" she added.\n\nBut after the duo uploaded the song to SoundCloud, the couple found that what started out as a shared gripe between a boyfriend and girlfriend also resonated with the public at large.\n\n\"We've heard a lot of people say, 'Wow, we never actually paid attention to the lyrics before -- this is awful!'\" said Liza.\n\nThe couple also said they hoped the song would raise awareness of the need for consent, given the problem of sexual assault on college campuses.\n\n\"It's not just a rare thing -- it happens all the time, everywhere. Every day. And I'm afraid for my sister. And I'm afraid for my friends. And I hope that this song gets people thinking about it,\" Lemanski said.\n\nLiza added that she hoped that the song would inspire others to take action to help prevent violence against women.\n\n\"I hope it will be on people's minds and that people will donate to charity or do some volunteer work at shelters or sexual assault centers. Like, if you think about this and you think it's a problem, definitely step out of your comfort zone and do something and help someone,\" she said.\n\nAnd having successfully designated their re-imagined \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" as an unofficial anthem for the importance of consent, the couple joked that there were some other candidates for the Liza and Lemanski treatment. \n\n\"A lot of people have suggested a bunch of songs, like Ella Fitzgerald's 'She Didn't Say Yes, She Didn't Say No' and Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines,'\" said Liza.\n\n\"We'll just do a whole album,\" she laughed.\n\nRead the original lyrics to \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" here and check out Lydia Liza and Josiah Lemanski's version below.\n\nI really can't stay/Baby I'm fine with that\n\nI've got to go away/Baby I'm cool with that\n\nThis evening has been/Been hoping you get home safe\n\nSo very nice/I'm glad you had a real good time\n\nMy mother will start to worry/Call her so she knows that you're coming\n\nFather will be pacing the floor/Better get your car a-humming\n\nSo really I'd better scurry/No rush. \n\nShould I use the front or back door?/Which one are you pulling towards more? \n\nThe neighbors might think/That you're a real nice girl\n\nWhat is this drink?/Pomegranate La Croix\n\nI wish I knew how/Maybe I can help you out\n\nTo break this spell/I don't know what you're talking about\n\nI ought to say no, no, no/you reserve the right to say no \n\nAt least I'm gonna say that I tried/you reserve the right to say no\n\nI really can't stay/...Well you don't have to\n\nBaby it's cold outside\n\nI've got to get home/Do you know how to get there from here\n\nSay, where is my coat/I'll go and grab it my dear\n\nYou've really been grand/We'll have to do this again\n\nYes I agree/How 'bout the Cheesecake Factory? \n\nWe're bound to be talking tomorrow/Text me at your earliest convenience\n\nAt least I have been getting that vibe/Unless I catch pneumonia and die\n\nI'll be on my way/Thanks for the great night", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.831353902816772, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 742, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.655554777357, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 6, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.808625336927224, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.545454545455}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/politics/trump-white-house-meetings/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "President Trump, home alone, puts out the White House welcome mat", "wordcount_as_scraped": 604, "date": "20170124030000", "story_content": "President Donald Trump is home alone, so suddenly one of the hottest new tickets in town is an invitation to the White House.\n\nThe President is going to start hitting the Washington dinner party circuit.

A piano played Billy Joel's \"New York State of Mind,\" as the President mingled with top Republicans and Democrats, all of whom are feeling their way in Trump's new Washington.\n\nThe President's aides have one thing in mind as he adjusts to his new surroundings: keeping the boss busy.\n\nPeople close to Trump's team acknowledged that his first weekend in office had been overtaken by the President engaging in a fight over crowd sizes and media coverage he perceived as negative. Alarmed Republicans urged allies inside the West Wing to instill discipline on the President's message.\n\nWith his wife, Melania, and son, Barron, back in New York, Trump has asked his advisers to stretch his schedule from daytime to nighttime, creating a far different environment at the White House than the last eight years.\n\nPresident Barack Obama left the Oval Office punctually for dinner with his young family on most nights, before returning to work later in the evening. President George W. Bush started and ended his days far earlier. \n\nNot since President Bill Clinton has the midnight oil routinely burned in the White House, where policy discussions and strategy sessions often went into the night. Trump will likely strike a balance somewhere between his three predecessors. \n\nKellyanne Conway, counselor to Trump, said the President's schedule will include working dinners most every evening. She said he plans to even hold some type of media dinners, despite his self-proclaimed war with the press. \n\nOn his first full weekday in office, it quickly became clear how eager Trump was to show his visitors around the West Wing, particularly the Oval Office. He held six separate photo opportunities Monday alone, including two with a group of union leaders who he summoned for a picture behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office after a meeting nearby in the Roosevelt Room ended.\n\nSean McGarvey, president of the North America's Building Trades Union, was beaming after he left.\n\n\"He took the time to take everyone into the Oval Office and show them the seat of power in the world,\" McGarvey said outside the White House. \"The respect that the President of the United States just showed us ... was nothing short of incredible.\"\n\nInvitations are starting to go out across Washington to visit Trump, aides said, including adversaries like members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus. \n\n\"He is someone who really enjoys that kind of conversation,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. \"I think you are going to see lot of meetings occur like the ones that he did today.\"\n\nIt's an open question how some Democratic groups will react to Trump's invitations. Eight years ago, several Republican lawmakers declined social invitations to the Obama White House, fearful of being seen as too cozy with the Democratic president.\n\nFor Trump, it's a new challenge.\n\nBut as he held court with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and their Republican counterparts Monday evening, all of whom later described the meeting as fairly free of deep substance, he declared: \"We're about to make a big deal.\" ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.12359547615051, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 595, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.06105164523, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.6890756302521, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/16/opinions/germany-open-door-policy-verkaik/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 747, "scraper_regex": 826}}, "headline": "How Germany's open-door refugee policy helps fight terrorism", "wordcount_as_scraped": 826, "date": "20170116150000", "story_content": "Donald Trump thinks that Angela Merkel's immigration policies have been a \"catastrophic mistake\" and has blamed the broader refugee crisis for Britain's decision to leave the EU. \n\nIn a joint interview for German newspaper Bild and the Times newspaper in London, the President-elect said: \"I have great respect for her, I felt she was a great leader, I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all these illegals and taking all these people where ever they come from and nobody really knows where they come from.\"\n\nHowever, I believe that Germany's open-door refugee policy will, in the long run, help protect Germans from terrorism. \n\nThere is evidence that with the right immigration policy, refugees can play a valuable role in the war against terror. \n\nGermany's decision is a ray of hope in a world of bleak humanitarian catastrophe. Rather than focus on the imagined links between terrorism and immigration, we should look at the long-term benefits of pursuing a plan that is helping to build stronger multi-cultural communities that can fight extremism. \n\nVital intelligence\n\nIn Germany, this policy is already delivering results with vital intelligence being passed by resident Muslims to the country's domestic security service, the BND.  \n\nThere is also evidence around the case of the Berlin market investigation that community informants have played their part in warning about the threat posed by prime suspect Anis Amri before the attack. An informant tipped off security services when he attempted to buy a gun. \n\nIntelligence from security agencies is almost always based on pointers gleaned from agents (not officers) working within the Muslim communities. Counter-terrorism operations tend to be intelligence-led but the security services never identify their sources. \n\nIn the UK, 12 terror plots have been disrupted in the last three years. Electronic surveillance and human intelligence are the two sources of intelligence used in tandem in such investigations.\n\nIn October last year, two Syrians managed to capture a terror suspect in Leipzig who was planning a bomb attack on German airports. Jaber al-Bakr went on the run after evading a security cordon set up by the security services. \n\nOther reports say he was only stopped when the Syrian refugees realized who he was and tricked him into meeting them in a flat and then tied him up before handing him over to the police. \n\n'Immense success against terrorism'\n\nTheir actions prompted the Mayor of Leipzig, Burkhard Jung, to offer his heart-felt thanks, praising the Syrians' bravery.  \"This is an immense success against terrorism and shows that a large majority of the foreigners and asylum seekers who live here want nothing to with this form of radical Islamism,\" he said. \n\nAnd in November last year, a German Muslim man who had returned from fighting ISIS in Syria provided information to German security services that led to the arrest of a major extremist cell. \n\nThese examples show that the German security services, in common with agencies across Europe, critically rely on intelligence passed on by members of its Muslim communities.  \n\n Ever since August 2015 when Germany opened its borders to refugees fleeing war zones across the Middle East, more than one million people have been offered sanctuary.  \n\nMerkel's message of peace\n\nBy showing compassion to hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees, Merkel's message to the worldwide Islamic community is one of peace.  Foreign policy that is perceived as anti-Muslim is recognized as a key radicalizing factor for violent extremists.     \n\nI believe Germany's humanitarian policy reduces the risk of her citizens being targeted by Middle East terror groups. The vast majority of Muslims now living in Germany should have every reason to cooperate with their own government in the fight against terrorism -- we can't win without them.\n\nThis is not something that can be said of the marginalized Muslim communities of the run-down suburbs of Brussels or Paris.\n\nToday, Germany's Muslims feel threatened by resurgent far-right groups and are watching closely how Merkel's responds to demands to get tough with refugees.\n\nHer decision to introduce laws to ban the burqa was widely criticized and if she is forced to row back on her immigration policy she risks losing the trust of the minority Muslim communities.\n\n No country is immune to terror\n\nThe Berlin terror attack underlines the difficult task facing Europe's security services when trying to stop mass murder carried out by a determined terrorist, whether the perpetrator is an immigrant or European national. No country can immunize itself from all terrorism.\n\nAnd if the incident shows us anything it is how collective failures on the part of the German, Italian and Tunisian security services let a known terror risk slip through their fingers. \n\nWith the upcoming Germany election, 2017 will prove to be a critical year -- Merkel will come under increasing pressure to water down her open-door immigration policy to win re-election. \n\nMerkel herself used her New Year message to defend her policy, saying Germany's freedoms will beat \"hate-filled\" terrorism. She is right.

Why exclude me from a march for women?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 916, "date": "20170117220000", "story_content": "I did not vote for President-Elect Donald Trump and continue to question his fitness to serve. Thus I am unsurprised that hundreds of thousands of women would want to protest his election this coming Saturday, the day after the inauguration. I am surprised, however, that the leaders of the Women's March on Washington\u2014and most feminists today\u2014are so unwilling to listen to an alternative feminist perspective, one with deep roots in feminist history and a good deal to offer to women today. \n\nAs a pro-choice activist who helped lead my college's Women's Center in the 1990s, and now, decades later, as a pro-life feminist, I too have looked forward to the day when a strong and accomplished woman would lead our nation. But however strong and accomplished, Secretary Clinton was not the woman for me. To me she represents all the contradictions of abortion rights feminism, contradictions also conspicuous in the guiding principles of the Women's March. In my view, an authentic women's movement\u2014one that properly extols human dignity, care, and non-violence\u2014must be unabashedly pro-life. \n\nWith both Trump's inauguration and the 44th anniversary of Roe v Wade decision fast approaching, I have been concerned that Donald Trump the man\u2014as president of the United States\u2014would actually strengthen in the American imagination the popular feminist fallacy that abortion is necessary to women's equality. After all, Donald Trump as \"pro-life candidate\" fit perfectly the pro-choice caricature of an abortion opponent: degrading to and disrespectful of women. If I could say just one thing to those at the Women's March, it would be this: the constitutional right to abortion has only made men like Trump worse.\n\nContraception fails. It just does. But constitutionalizing the right to abortion as Roe did in January 1973 hasn't relieved women of the consequences of sex or the vulnerabilities of pregnancy. Rather it has detached men even further from sex's procreative potential and, for the poor in particular, increased the vulnerability of both women and children. That is, easy abortion empowers the male illusion that sex can finally be completely consequence-free. For men, anyway. \n\nThe ascendancy of abortion rights feminism over the last fifty years has failed to remedy the sort of objectification of women on particular display by our president-elect in the unearthed Access Hollywood video and beyond. As pro-life feminists have long argued, the undisciplined testosterone-driven male libido, interested in no-strings-attached sex, benefits most from an abortion-permissive culture. And when male sexuality goes undisciplined, bereft of the deep emotional bonds once demanded by self-respecting women, sex is sought for pleasure alone. For the most callous of men, women become mere pleasure-providers, the objects of the male libido's aggressive demands. \n\nIndeed, worry over the tendencies of dissolute men was a key reason women's suffragists of the late 19th century did not see abortion as the panacea their successors have. Unlike today's abortion-rights-feminists, the suffragists feared that sex unmoored from its procreative potential would increase male sexual immorality and infidelity. The suffragists were seeking just the reverse: \"Votes for women, chastity for men\" was actually a suffragist slogan. \n\nAnd yet, in a bitter irony (with encouragement from some men), those carrying the feminist mantel in the 1970s abandoned this vision of sexual integrity for both sexes and legalized abortion became the sine qua non of sexual freedom. Transforming male-oriented institutions\u2014and the men that governed them\u2014was just too difficult: conforming women's bodies seemed a far easier path. If men could reduce sex to sport, denying the intimate connection created with the women they bedded and the children they fathered, well, women ought to be able to do the same. \n\nOnly we can't. Sex-induced hormones connect us more than \"casual\" sex would seem to allow. And women must worry about pregnancy, about how carrying a child would impact our bodies, and how caring for a child would shape our futures. And so, women also tend to see more clearly the vulnerability inherent in the human condition, the human goods brought about in giving care, and how our politics affect those at the margins. \n\nSo why would women ever think it \"better\" to treat sex, the act that creates new dependent human life, so casually, as if it lacked profound consequences for connection and caregiving? Why would any feminist think it is a moral advance for women to imitate male abandonment of the vulnerable through abortion? \n\nInfluential women such as Anne-Marie Slaughter thankfully have begun to highlight a more authentic feminist logic: if society better valued caregiving, then perhaps men would do more of it, and we'd see greater collaboration in the home, more equity in the workplace, and more family-friendly policies. But as pro-choice law professor Robin West has noticed, the constitutionalizing of abortion rights in Roe stands in dramatic tension with a political agenda that better values caregiving. \n\n Were it not for the wedding of modern feminism with the sexual revolution, many more men, I think, would more readily value the culturally essential work of caregiving. Both research and my personal experience suggests that men who aren't beholden to the fleeting attractions of sexual pleasure do value caregiving, and consider the nurture and education of their children their most essential work. I dare say that these men are the very picture of the emotionally available, responsible, and engaged husbands and fathers my feminist sisters and I once dreamed of.  Abortion rights will not produce more such men; but a greater appreciation that sex is a serious enterprise just might.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.26600980758667, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 894, "FairnessVirtue": 9, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 10, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.20123942939, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 39, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.36241610738255, "mft_mean": 3.54545454545}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/18/politics/obama-final-news-conference-scene/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Obama offers reassurance mixed with warnings", "wordcount_as_scraped": 680, "date": "20170119000000", "story_content": "\"The only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world.\"\n\nWith that parting message to the nation, a sanguine Barack Obama sought to reassure the millions of Democrats disorientated and fearful about Donald Trump's pending inauguration that presidents may change but the nation always endures.\n\nStill, in his final news conference as president, Obama warned that only an active citizenry and relentless political engagement can preserve what he sees as the successes of his administration and the values he believes have already made America great.\n\nObama drew a figurative line between his about-to-expire administration and the incoming Republican one that aims to destroy much of his legacy. His comments established an implicit scorecard for voters to use when judging which vision of government they prefer in the years ahead. Obama also struck a striking stylistic contrast with the President-elect, hinting at the change that will come to White House optics in two days.\n\nBut mostly he offered a message of reassurance at a time of national uncertainty after the most tumultuous presidential transition in modern history. \n\n\"This is not just a matter of no drama Obama, this is what I really believe,\" Obama told reporters in the White House press briefing room. \"It is true that behind closed doors, I curse more than I do publicly ... and sometimes I get mad and frustrated like everybody else does.

But Obama, citing the resilience of his daughters Malia and Sasha after the shock of the election, told his supporters: \"We've tried to teach them hope and that the only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world.\"\n\nObama's final news conference was also a chance for Obama, as aides packed up their belongings in the maze of West Wing offices behind the briefing room, to display the courtly manner that has rarely slipped in eight White House years.\n\nHe was constrained and cool, chose vocabulary that tiptoed around controversy, and called on journalists from a list prepared by his staff. His interactions with reporters was respectful but mostly distant. It was one last chance to witness the professorial demeanor that comes across to many Republicans as patronizing.\n\nThings will change from Friday at noon.\n\nJust a week ago, in his own news conference, the President-elect oozed passion and a relentless relish for confrontation. He called on reporters not off a pre-planned rotation but with a swing of his arm.\n\nWith a 60% approval rating on his way out the door, according to a CNN/ORC poll, Obama appeared confident his place in history is secure. \n\nStill, Trump won the only contest that matters in November and will now have the chance to wipe out much of Obama's legacy.\n\nThat successive elections could have produced such different presidents in temperament and political background perhaps shows the elasticity of the American political system and the uncertainty of the times. Obama, conscious that his successor was probably watching on television, sought to avoid open conflicts with Trump even as the contrasts were clear. \n\nHe mounted a ringing defense of a free media and the need for the White House press corps to hold a president to account from within the West Wing itself -- a status Trump aides have already suggested may be at risk. \n\nIn a clear nod to the push for the diversity that has been an undercurrent of his administration, Obama's questioners included a Latina woman, a journalist for an Arab television channel, an African American woman and a man who works for an LGBT publication.\n\nAfter an hour-and-a-quarter, Obama simply said \"Thank you very much, press corps -- good luck\" as a presidency that opened in a euphoric blast of hope and change slipped quietly into its final hours.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.962861061096191, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 681, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.52589890717, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170119000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.79001468428781, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/22/politics/trump-hotel-emoluments/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 871, "scraper_regex": 935}}, "headline": "Trump's DC hotel is the new legal hot spot in town", "wordcount_as_scraped": 935, "date": "20170122170000", "story_content": "The moment Donald Trump became the 45th President, some legal experts say he triggered a violation of the foreign emoluments clause in the Constitution, flouted the plain terms of the lease for his Washington hotel, and opened himself up to a dizzying array of ethical questions on financial conflicts of interests.\n\nFor months, a vocal group of constitutional lawyers, ethics law scholars and Democrats on Capitol Hill have urged Trump to avoid the legal perplexities posed by his vast business enterprises and divest his assets into a truly blind trust (or the equivalent).\n\nHis response?\n\n\"The law is totally on my side, meaning, the President can't have a conflict of interest,\" Trump told The New York Times.\n\n\"I have have a no conflict situation because I'm President ... it's a nice thing to have,\" he repeated to reporters at a news conference earlier this month. \n\nTrump instead pledged to resign from management of the Trump Organization, but according to an investigation by ProPublica apparently has not done so yet; promised to put his investments into some type of trust controlled by his two adult sons, but will not sell off his business holdings; and still refuses to release his taxes, but said he will hire an in-house ethics adviser.\n\nThe Trump hotel, emoluments and conflicts\n\nOf all the potential legal problems posed by Trump's financial holdings, none is more immediate and complicated than the hotel he opened in the Old Post Office in DC. \n\nThe Trump Organization leased the property from the federal General Services Administration in 2013, but a clause in the lease states that no \"elected official of the government ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.\"\n\nAs of Saturday night, the GSA has not declared the Trump Organization in breach of the contract, and declined to comment on the status of any negotiations to resolve the apparent breach.\n\nThe Trump Organization and the White House also did not respond to requests for comment. \n\nBut at least one liberal group was quick to file a complaint.\n\n\"Elected government officials are barred from receiving any benefit under the lease, and now that Mr. Trump has been sworn in today as President of the United States, Trump Old Post Office LLC, a company he largely owns, is in violation of the lease's conflicts-of-interest provision,\" wrote the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington in a letter to the GSA.\n\n\"This is bad as it gets,\" said Norm Eisen, who served as a chief White House ethics lawyer in the Obama administration.  \n\nThe hotel's Twitter account, on the other hand, exclaimed Friday: \"We are waiting for you Mr. President!

Bush, along with Harvard Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe, to argue that the emoluments clause \"covers even ordinary, fair market value transactions that result in any economic profit or benefit\" to the President. \n\nIn other words: \"Trump can't receive any direct payment of any kind from a foreign government, including a fee for services,\" agrees Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman.\n\nSo yes, those expensive drinks at the hotel bar count. As does the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.'s lease payments for space in Trump Tower.\n\nWho has the power to resolve these issues?\n\nGiven all of these weighty legal issues facing Trump's presidency, the natural question for many is: Who has standing to enforce a Constitutional violation?\n\nThe short answer is Congress. \n\n\"Congress would be well within its rights to impeach him for engaging in 'high crimes and misdemeanors',\" according to Eisen, Painter and Tribe if there was reason to believe Trump violated the emoluments clause.   \n\nCongress could also create a brand new cause of action allowing private parties -- think business competitors -- to file suit.\n\nBut given that both the House and Senate remain under Republican control, the likelihood of action on either front is unlikely at best.\n\nAt the end of the day, many experts say it might simply be left up to the voters if the President and Congress do not adequately address these issues.\n\n\"How the public reacts may depend on whether it appears the conflicts are affecting decisions,\" Noble said. \"This is why we expect the president to follow certain norms and not try to push the legal envelope on ethics rules.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.5151515007018999, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 871, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 17, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.5966341715, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 7, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 51, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170122170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.85533869115959, "mft_mean": 4.63636363636}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/09/arts/mystery-of-the-boxwood-miniatures/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 862, "scraper_regex": 969}}, "headline": "500-year-old secrets of boxwood miniatures unlocked", "wordcount_as_scraped": 969, "date": "20161209070000", "story_content": "After hundreds of years, experts have solved one of the art world's great mysteries. \n\nSince the early 1500s, miniature boxwood carvings have confounded viewers with their depictions of heaven, hell and life on Earth, sculpted in minute detail. \n\nCoveted by the wealthiest members of the upper class, clergymen and royalty (Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, had one), a boxwood carving was the ultimate symbol of luxury and status. \n\nAnd then, in just a few decades, they disappeared. With no records of who made them, nor instructions detailing how they were made, an inimitable art was lost. \n\nRead: What we can learn from the tattoos of our ancestors\n\n\"They're objects that defy modern comprehension,\" says Alexandra Suda, a curator of European art at the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) in Toronto, Canada. \"As small as they are, they represent the limitless potential for human creativity in a way that is universal.\" \n\nSuda is co-leading a five-year international study of the secrets behind these boxwood carvings. \n\nA collaboration between scientists, conservators, curators and academics from some of the world's most prestigious institutions -- the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York, the Rijksmuseum, in Amsterdam, and NASA's Glenn Research Center, in Cleveland -- the study saw 30 of the 135 surviving carvings scanned and analyzed to figure out how they were made, and by whom.  \n\nThis autumn, their findings are being presented as part of \"Small Wonders: Gothic Boxwood Miniatures,\" a new exhibition at the AGO.\n\nA lost art \n\nEven from a distance, the miniatures are baffling. Small enough to fit in your hand, their recessed religious scenes contain an astounding amount of detail. Look closely and you may see a crown of thorns on Christ's brow or a man's head looking out from the demonic mouth of hell. \n\nDevotional objects by design, these beads, rosaries and altarpieces acted as tokens of faith and, like stained glass windows or religious sculptures, added an element of divine beauty to the act of prayer.\n\n\"They have this jigsaw puzzle, Rubik's cube, horror vacui kind of effect on you where you look at them,\" Suda says. \"They're so intricate, and they're so stunningly carved that you almost immediately make that (religious) connection, in spite of the fact that you may not be a practicing Christian.\" \n\nThanks to a generous posthumous donation from the late publishing magnate Ken Thompson (the richest man in Canada when he died in 2006), the AGO has had the world's largest collection of boxwood miniatures since 2008, with 10 beads and two altarpieces in their collection.\n\nThis placed the museum in a unique position of leverage when, in 2011, Suda first proposed the idea of a large-scale investigation into the works' origins to former colleagues at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and later, Frits Scholten, senior curator of sculpture at the Rijksmuseum, who has written extensively on boxwood carvings. \n\nThe plan was to scan as many of the surviving boxwood miniatures as possible. Lisa Ellis, the AGO's sculpture and decorative arts conservator, took the lead, locating suitable facilities around the world in which to scan examples from the AGO, the Met and the Rijksmuseum, along with contributions from the Natural History Museum in London, the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and the Cleveland Museum of Art, among other institutions.\n\nRead: London's secret underground railway system\n\nStanding theories suggested that the works had been assembled in pieces, but the scans established the process definitively. \n\nOnce a piece of boxwood was shaped into a circle, it was bisected and then sliced into thin discs. Individual discs were then carved along the curve into single layers of the recessed final scene, and then stacked in such a way that the seams between the discs -- the points where they were connected -- were concealed from view.\n\nA mystery maker \n\nBut while the secret of how the miniatures were constructed is a considerable discovery in itself, it has also upended the dominant theory about who created them. \n\nThere are no known records of specific creators (the pieces are, surprisingly, unsigned), but it was largely accepted that the miniatures were produced by between four and six different workshops in Flanders. With estimates that each must have taken about four to five years to make, this seemed the most logical explanation. \n\nRead: Mysterious gown of salt crystals rises from Dead Sea\n\nHowever, the consistency in construction that the scans revealed seem to suggest a single master craftsman. \n\n\"That was the thing that really hit us over the head like a frying pan: This is the product of one guy's vision -- probably with a few apprentices and assistants -- who was extraordinarily gifted. When he died, this practice ceased to exist,\" Suda says. \n\n\"I rarely use the term genius, but I would say that this person if not a genius, is certainly an exception to the norm.\" \n\nRead: Stronger than concrete? Why this new material could define our age\n\nAs of now, there are few leads as to who this mystery maker might have been, but Suda is now determined to discover their identity and source of inspiration. \n\n\"I'm dying to know where they got all of the imagery. When you start to think yeah, this is amazing that they were able to make these physically, the next logical question is, 'How did they come up will all of these incredibly imaginative images?'\" Suda says. \n\n\"The thing that really connected with me was that whoever this artist was was certainly inviting their original viewer to consider the possibility of it all, and he was quite successful because we're still thinking about that today.\" \n\n\"Small Wonders: Gothic Boxwood Miniatures\" is on at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, Canada until Jan. 22, 2017.

two vantage points in Hampstead Heath (Parliament Hill and the stately home Kenwood House); Primrose Hill has another spot, 63 meters above sea level; Greenwich Park's General Wolfe Statue; Westminster Pier; and King Henry VIII's mound -- over 10 miles (16 km) away from St Paul's Cathedral and only visible through a cultivated gap in a hedge.\n\nWhile Londoners would likely agree that these panoramas are impressive -- and Primrose Hill, Alexandra Palace and Hampstead Heath are well-known viewing spots -- few realize that the fine panoramas are protected. \n\nExceptions to the rule\n\nWhile the eight protected views of St Paul's have survived since the 1930s, some exceptions have been made. \n\nThe Shard -- the UK's tallest building and the tallest in Western Europe -- for example, is situated in the Kenwood House viewing corridor.\n\nGwyn Richards, the City of London's head of design, tells CNN that when proposals are suggested for new buildings, the viewing corridors always come under consideration.\n\n\"It would be difficult to argue that you could breach the foreground of the view,\" says Richards, \"But there's more of a debate to be hand when buildings breach the background. You need to assess whether or not that proposal affects your ability to see [St Paul's]\".\n\nThe Shard exists in the background area of the Hampstead Hill viewing corridor. \n\nDevelopers and London officials had to make a judgment call as to whether or the Shard's presence would impede views.\n\nAfter much debate, it was considered acceptable.\n\nSo, The Shard dominates the vista from Parliament Hill and Kenwood House -- not blocking the view, but certainly changing it.\n\n The view forward\n\nSome experts, however, are beginning to question whether city planners should be protecting views of St Paul's in the 21st century.\n\nIs Sir Christopher Wren's hallowed dome really more important than other modern landmarks, or London's need for development?\n\nAnnie Hampson, the City of London Planning Officer -- whose role shaping London's landscape lead her to be named by the London Evening Standard one of the \"most influential people in London\" -- tells CNN that buildings \"gain importance and lose importance\" throughout history. \n\nShe cites as an example 30 St Mary Axe, aka the Gherkin. Widely derided when finished in 2003, today, Hampson says, \"some people have begun to see the Gherkin as an important London landmark. One has to accept that views do change.\" \n\nAre views of the Gherkin less worthy of protection than those of St Paul's?\n\n\"Some people say these (protected) views act as a constraint on development, can London deliver enough accommodation while still protecting these views?\" she adds.\n\nArchitect Barbara Weiss, founder of the Skyline Campaign -- a pressure group that lobbies against the onslaught of tall buildings in development in London -- deems the protected view corridors out of date and elitist.\n\n\"They are very anachronistic, an expression of the class system. Certain views are protected from certain angles but from South London much less so,\" Weiss says, noting that the viewing corridors tend to emanate from wealthier parts of London.\n\nOthers are in favor of keeping the corridors.\n\n\"I believe protected views are helpful in providing a constraint that aids development,\" explains Peter Wynne Rees, the former City of London City Planning Officer, \"but you can't protect every view of everywhere\".  \n\nOne thing is clear: on a crisp, sunny autumn afternoon, Primrose Hill is packed with locals and tourists alike -- taking photographs, picnicking and admiring the iconic London vista. \n\nThey might not know that it's protected, but they are certainly enjoying the view.Which amazing city view would you love to see protected?

The President-elect's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, reportedly even played a key role in undermining the prospects of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The alleged motive, moreover, was Christie's earlier prosecution of Kushner's father for fraudulent dealings.\n\nBut the concern rose another notch when daughter Ivanka Trump (along with Kushner) reportedly attended a meeting between her father and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Such an incident did not seem to be just another clumsy manifestation of garden-variety nepotism, as bad as that aspect might be. Ivanka is poised to head the vast Trump business empire. Her participation in the meeting with the leader of one of America's most important trading and investment partners constituted a flagrant conflict of interest for the President-elect.\n\nNepotism is nothing new in the history of the US presidency, although the Trump administration looks as though it may be especially susceptible. Perhaps the most blatant case was President John F. Kennedy's appointment of his brother Robert to the post of attorney general. That decision so rankled the political establishment that Congress eventually passed a statute that in the future barred members of the President's family from holding appointed posts in his or her administration. Kushner appears to be trying to find a way around that prohibition.\n\nExcluding relatives from official posts, though, hardly solves the nepotism problem; even when relatives do not occupy policymaking positions, they can still have a considerable impact on policy.  Informal advisers can, and throughout America's history have, influenced occupants of the Oval Office.  And those advisers often are friends or relatives. \n\nPerhaps the toughest problem to address is the role of the presidential spouse. The post of first lady (or first gentleman, in the event of a female president) is supposed to be primarily ceremonial or dealing with noncontroversial matters.  That's an important point, because there is no provision for formal accountability, whether congressional oversight or some other mechanism, for policy initiatives undertaken by a person in that post. Yet some first ladies have exercised a substantial amount of influence over policy. Indeed, historians generally believe that Woodrow Wilson's wife, Edith, virtually ran the presidency for the final 18 months after his debilitating stroke in October 1919.\n\nIn our own era, first lady Hillary Clinton played extremely important roles in both her husband's domestic and foreign policy initiatives. She was so deeply involved in the design of the administration's (ultimately unsuccessful) health care plan that wags at one Washington think tank privately derided it as \"HillBilly Health Care.\" \n\nHer greatest impact, though, may have come on policy in the Balkans -- in her discussions on Serbia with Bill Clinton, she later admitted, \"I urged him to bomb.\" The alleged episode is described by Gail Sheehy in her book \"Hillary's Choice\": \n\n\"On March 21, 1999, Hillary expressed her views by phone to the President: 'I urged him to bomb.'  The Clintons argued the issue over the next few days.  [The President expressed] what-ifs: What if bombing promoted more executions?  What if it took apart the NATO alliance?  Hillary responded: 'You cannot let this go on at the end of a century that has seen the major holocaust of our time.  What do we have NATO for if not to defend our way of life?' The next day the President declared that force was necessary.\"  \n\nIf accurate, this would be a case of a presidential family member having not just some influence, but a decisive impact on policy. And such advice would have been offered without Clinton having had to undergo scrutiny from anyone else in a position of responsibility. Unfortunately, that type of influence is something that is extraordinarily difficult to guard against.  There is no way to pass a law against presidential pillow talk, or one that bars the President from talking about a policy issue with his or her spouse or children over dinner. \n\nThe reality is that nepotism is an ever-present temptation. One would hope that both the President-elect and his family members would exercise restraint. But that would require President-elect Trump to acknowledge that the American people have elected him, not his entire family.

Now a study adds a new type of cancer to the list, and it's an unexpected one: Brown University researchers say that drinking, even in moderate amounts, is associated with higher rates of melanoma -- the deadliest form of skin cancer.\n\nTheir research revealed more interesting facts, as well. In the study, white wine had a bigger impact on melanoma risk than red wine, beer, or liquor. And compared with teetotalers, alcohol drinkers' increased risk was greatest for body parts that normally aren't exposed to the sun.\n\nSome scientists have speculated that alcohol may make us more susceptible to sunburns, says co-author Eunyoung Cho, ScD, an associate professor of dermatology and epidemiology at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. But the new findings indicate there may be something else going on beneath the surface, she says.\n\nAbout 3.6% of cancer cases worldwide are thought to be caused by alcohol, the authors note. \"For some, like cancers of the digestive tract, the alcohol actually comes in contact with the tissue, so it's easier to understand,\" says Cho. \"For others, like breast cancer, we don't really have a great explanation at this point why alcohol would be related.\"\n\n6 Things Your Dermatologist Wants You to Know About Skin Cancer\n\nOne theory, she says, is that a compound in alcohol called acetaldehyde can damage DNA, and prevent DNA repair, throughout the body. \"It's a well known carcinogen, so that could be a very general mechanism as to how alcohol relates to cancer at other sites,\" she says.\n\nThere's been little research on alcohol and skin cancer risk, however, and the studies that have been conducted have been inconclusive. They haven't included much information about participants' sun exposure, says Cho, which could affect the results.\n\nSo Cho and her colleagues collected data from three large studies involving 210,252 participants, all of whom provided information about their drinking habits, place of residence, and health history -- including details about sunburns and tanning. Over an 18-year follow-up period, 1,374 people (less than 1% of all participants) were diagnosed with invasive melanoma. \n\nThe results, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, showed that each drink per day was associated with a 14% higher risk of melanoma. (A standard drink was defined as 12.8 grams of pure alcohol, or about the amount found in one beer, glass of wine, or shot of hard liquor.)\n\nAnd when the researchers looked at each beverage type individually, they found that one drink stood out: Each glass of white wine per day was associated with a 13% increased risk of melanoma, while other forms of alcohol did not affect risk in a statistically meaningful way.\n\nWhat Skin Cancer Looks Like\n\nSome research has shown that wine has higher levels of acetaldehyde than beer or spirits, says Cho, while red wine's greater antioxidant content may offset the risks of these compounds. \n\nBut she won't let other beverages off the hook just yet. \"Other alcoholic beverages did show some positive correlation, but did not reach statistical significance,\" she says. \"For now, I would say that alcohol in general is related, and I would emphasize that white wine is particularly related.\" \n\nAnother surprise came when the researchers looked at melanoma rates on different body parts. People who drank 20 grams or more of alcohol per day (a little less than two drinks) were only 2% more likely than non-drinkers to be diagnosed with melanomas of the head, neck, arms, or legs.  But they were 73% more likely to be diagnosed with melanomas of the trunk -- a body part often covered by clothing.\n\nMore research is needed to explain why this may be the case, says Cho. \"There is a hypothesis that melanomas on different body sites may have different risk factors,\" she says. \"Based on these findings, I might guess that this type of cancer is less related to sun exposure and more related to a biological mechanism of alcohol damaging DNA or preventing DNA repair.\"\n\n6 Spots Your Doc Should Check for Skin Cancer\n\nThe study only included white people, so the results cannot be generalized to other races or ethnic groups. And because it was observational, it was not able to determine a cause-and-effect relationship between alcohol (and white wine specifically) and melanoma rates.\n\nBut the study did control for several factors, including the number of severe sunburns participants had ever had, their number of moles, and the average amount of ultraviolet radiation where they lived. These adjustments help strengthen the theory that alcohol really does play a role in melanoma development, Cho says -- and not simply that people who drink regularly, or who prefer white wine, are more likely to spend hours by the pool or on the beach. (One thing they weren't able to take into account, however, was sun-protection behaviors, such as using sunscreen.)  \n\n\"There are many risk factors for melanoma that you cannot change, like family history, hair color, and susceptibility to sunburn,\" Cho says. \"But drinking alcohol is something you can change, so it's actually good to know that alcohol is related to melanoma as well as other cancers.\"\n\nThe study's findings support existing recommendations by the American Cancer Society to limit alcohol intake, she notes, but adds that moderate alcohol consumption has also been linked to a lower risk of heart disease. \"People already know that alcohol consumption is related to increased risk for many cancers and we are just adding another one to that list,\" she says. \"For those who drink alcohol, its risks and benefits need to be considered individually -- including the risk related to melanoma.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.59788370132446, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 837, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 0.616575453011, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.955794504181601, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/donald-trump-nominees-global-issues/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Where Donald Trump's views differ -- and align -- with his nominees on global issues", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1346, "date": "20170120130000", "story_content": "Donald Trump is set to become one of the most powerful people in the world Friday, but his administration's view of the US role in global affairs is far from unified.\n\nAs Trump's prospective secretary of state, defense secretary and US ambassador to the United Nations were quizzed at Senate confirmation hearings over the past two weeks, significant differences emerged between the views of the incoming president and his nominees.\n\nBut Trump is looking past those differences. He recently tweeted: \"All of my cabinet nominees are looking good and doing a great job. I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine!\"\n\nHere's a look at where Trump and his cabinet stand on a range of foreign policy issues.\n\nRUSSIA  \n\nWhere Trump stands: Trump recently admitted he believed Russia was behind election-related hacking, after months of refusing to acknowledge it was possible. He's expressed a willingness to work with Russia in Syria and suggested he might recognize Russia's claim to Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in 2014. He's promised to improve relations between the two countries and suggested he'd be open to lifting sanctions on the Kremlin, if Russia helps the US battle terrorists and if they can strike a nuclear weapons deal.  But he said he plans to keep sanctions for \"at least a period of time.\"\n\nWhere his pick for Secretary of State stands: At his hearing, former ExxonMobil chief Rex Tillerson said he'd support providing arms to Ukraine and called Russia's invasion an \"illegal action.\" He suggested there were benefits to keeping sanctions in place. Tillerson described hacking allegations as \"troubling\" and agreed it was a \"fair assumption\" that Russian President Vladmir Putin authorized the attacks.\n\nWhere his pick for Secretary of Defense stands: Retired Marine Gen. James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis said there were \"a decreasing number of areas where we can engage cooperatively, and an increasing number of areas where we're going to have to confront Russia.\" In reference to the merits of sanctions on Russia, Mattis said it was important to recognize the \"reality of what we deal with (in) Mr. Putin.\"\n\nWhere his pick for UN Ambassador stands: South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley also acknowledged election-related Russian hacking and emphasized her support for maintaining sanctions: \"I certainly think they should be preserved and I don't think they should be lifted until we see a ... change.\"\n\nNATO\n\nWhere Trump stands: Trump has sent mixed signals. He's called NATO \"obsolete\" because it was designed many years ago. He criticized member states for not paying their fair share to the military alliance, which many see as a vital bulwark against potential Russian aggression. But he also said \"NATO is very important to me\" and said that Europe can depend on an American security guarantee.\n\nWhere Tillerson stands: Tillerson said NATO's collective defense \"commitment is inviolable and the US is going to stand behind that commitment.\"\n\nWhere Mattis stands: Mattis, a former Supreme Allied Commander for NATO's transformation command, has provided unequivocal support for the alliance. \"If we did not have NATO today, we would need to create it,\" Mattis said, describing it as \"vital to our national interests, and it's vital to the security of the United States.\"\n\nWhere Haley stands: Haley reaffirmed the value of NATO and said she believed Trump's views would inevitably shift as his national security team advised him. \"NATO has obviously been an alliance that we value and an alliance that we need to keep,\" Haley said.\n\nIRAN\n\nWhere Trump stands: Trump has pledged to renegotiate the deal with the U.S. and five other countries to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for an easing of sanctions, describing it as a \"terrible\" agreement.\n\nWhere Tillerson stands: Tillerson said he supports a \"full review\" of the nuclear deal: \"We need to examine our ability to clarify whether Iran is complying.\"\n\nWhere Mattis stands: \"It's not a deal I would have signed,\" Mattis said. He told lawmakers he would ask Congress to form a joint committee to oversee the implementation of the accord, boost intelligence community monitoring, and have \"a combined missile defense, air and missile defense capability, for our Gulf allies.\" \n\nWhere Haley stands: Haley said it would be better for the US to carefully review the Iran nuclear deal rather than unilaterally withdraw from it: \"I think what would be more beneficial at this point is that we look at all the details of the Iran deal, we see if they (the Iranians) are actually in compliance. If we find that there are violations then we act on those violations.\" \n\nCHINA\n\nWhere Trump stands: Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese goods and has called out Beijing for what he described as its \"brazen\" island-building activities in the South China Sea. He's also questioned whether the US should maintain its longstanding position that Taiwan is part of \"One China,\" and broke diplomatic protocol by speaking to the president of Taiwan.\n\nWhere Tillerson stands: Tillerson called China's actions in the South China Sea \"extremely worrisome\" and compared them to Russia's Ukraine adventure: \"Building islands and then putting military assets on those islands is akin to Russia's taking of Crimea.\"\n\nWhere Mattis stands: Mattis identified Chinese island-building in the South China Sea as one of the biggest security issues since WWII -- along with Russian aggression and terrorism. \n\nWhere Haley stands: Haley didn't mention the South China Sea during her hearing, but she stressed the importance of working closely with China to deal with North Korea. Haley said she would try to convince Beijing that it is in China's national interests to work with Washington to curb North Korea's nuclear program.\n\nISRAEL\n\nWhere Trump stands: Trump has pledged to relocate the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and slammed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to Israel's development of settlements in the West Bank.\n\nWhere Tillerson stands: Tillerson described Israel as America's most important ally, and called the UN resolution on settlements \"not helpful.\" He added that the resolution \"undermines\" the conditions for peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nWhere Mattis stands: \"Right now I go with US policy,\" Mattis said when asked whether he would support moving the embassy to Jerusalem, adding that he would defer to the nominee for secretary of state. Mattis also said he supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict if it promotes peace, but he has not weighed in on the UN resolution condemning settlements in the West Bank. \n\nWhere Haley stands: In her opening statement, Haley spoke at length on one international issue: Israel. Haley condemned what she described as a long history of \"anti-Israel bias\" at the UN and called the resolution on settlements \"very harmful to achieving the two-state solution.\"\n\nISIS\n\nWhere Trump stands: Trump has said he would \"bomb the s***\" out of ISIS and that he would declare war on the terror group while putting \"very few\" US boots on the ground. He's also spoken of joining forces with Russia to eliminate ISIS in Syria.\n\nWhere Tillerson stands: Tillerson has called defeating ISIS the most urgent step in thwarting \"radical Islam.\" \"Defeating ISIS must be our foremost priority in the Middle East,\" he said, adding that competing priorities in the region \"must not distract from the mission of defeating ISIS.\"\n\nWhere Mattis stands: The retired four-star general has called for an \"integrated strategy\" to deliver a \"very hard blow\" against ISIS -- and emphasized that for any strategy to succeed, it must target recruiting and fundraising by the terrorist group.\n\nWhere Haley stands: Haley criticized Barack Obama for being \"unwilling or unable\" to deal with the threat of ISIS in January 2016. But when asked this week whether she would support a congressional authorization for the use of military force against ISIS, Haley was less definitive: \"I do think that [ISIS] has to be dealt with. I just think it needs to be done responsibly, knowing that we have a measurables on what we're looking for, where the end goal is, and knowing where exactly the start and stop is.\" ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.00358426570892, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1298, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.93962703273, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 39, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170120130000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.00462249614792, "mft_mean": 3.54545454545}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/14/us/fbi-hate-crime-report-muslims/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 520, "scraper_regex": 624}}, "headline": "FBI: Hate crimes spike, most sharply against Muslims  ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 624, "date": "20161115040000", "story_content": "The latest FBI annual hate crime report shows a sharp spike in the number of hate crimes nationwide, with attacks against Muslims increasing the most sharply. \n\nIn one year, anti-Muslim hate crimes in the United States rose 67%, from 154 incidents in 2014 to 257 in 2015, according to the latest numbers released in the bureau's Hate Crime Statistics report on Monday. \n\nIn sheer numbers, anti-Jewish incidents (664) were higher in 2015, but the percentage increase was much higher for incidents involving Muslim victims.\n\n\"That is the highest number since 2001, when the al Qaeda attacks on New York and elsewhere drove the number to its highest ever level, 481 hate crimes,\" according to Mark Potok with the Southern Poverty Law Center. \n\nThe FBI defines a hate crime as a \"criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.\" \n\nLaw enforcement agencies submit incident reports annually; the reports include information detailing the offenses, victims, offenders and locations of hate crimes. \n\nThe bureau's Uniform Crime Reporting Program data showed 5,850 hate crime incidents reported to police in 2015, a 6.8% increase from the 5,479 incidents reported in 2014. \n\nThe report recorded 5,818 \"single-bias\" incidents, incidents in which one or more offense types are motivated by the same bias.

While the nuclear nations of China and Russia are both pushing back against US power across the globe, they are more integrated into the international system and neither is as erratic or threatening.

But \"North Korea is a multi-spectrum threat to the US, its allies and international peace and security.\"\n\n\"This is the worst regime in the world trying to acquire the worst weapons in the world and the means to reach the US with them,\" Victor Cha, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said of North Korea.\u00a0\"In terms of a direct threat to American security, this is it.\"\u00a0\n\nRussian, Chinese threats differ\u00a0\n\nHe said that threat is different than that from major powers Russia and China.\n\n\"With Russia and China, we're mutually deterred\" because of nuclear capabilities, he explained. \"With North Korea, you just don't know what this guy is going to do.\"\n\nPyongyang has a million-man army poised along the border with South Korea, where US forces are based. The state engages in massive counterfeiting operations of the US $100 bill and in the manufacturing of methamphetamine. US security officials place it in the top five cyber threats worldwide. It has an estimated 16 to 20 nuclear weapons and is steadily working to miniaturize them and improve the range and accuracy of\u00a0missiles to deliver them.\n\nNorth Korea's new boast about an ICBM that could deliver those weapons to the US\u00a0comes as Washington is undergoing a leadership transition -- always a fragile time -- and South Korea is in political disarray, with its president temporarily stripped of her powers because of corruption charges and facing a court ruling on whether she should be reinstated or removed from office.\n\nKim sees 2017 as \"an opportune time\" to complete development of a nuclear weapon because of these leadership challenges, according to a high-level North Korean diplomat who recently defected to South Korea. Kim is \"determined\" to complete development of a nuclear weapon by the end of 2017, the diplomat said at a December press briefing, according to Yonhap news agency.\u00a0\n\n\"This is not just saber-rattling to get attention,\" Cha said. \"This is an actual military goal they're seeking.\"\n\nAnd they're\u00a0well on their way, despite repeated international attempts over decades to slow Pyongyang's program through sanctions and diplomacy. North Korea conducted an unprecedented number of missile tests in 2016 and a satellite launch that experts call a sign that it has cleared significant hurdles toward ICBM technology.\u00a0\n\nIt has already notched other potentially lethal successes.\u00a0\n\nPyongyang fired a submarine-based ballistic missile in August, a weapon that South Korea has no viable defense against, said Klingner, a former chief of the CIA's Korea branch.\u00a0After the test, the South Korean Defense Ministry revised its estimate on the North's ability to deploy submarine-launched missiles from around four years to as little as a year.\u00a0\n\nThe country likely already has working nuclear warheads for its Nodong medium-range ballistic missile, which threatens all of South Korea and Japan, experts say.\n\nAnd Pyongyang's intermediate range missile, the Musudan, can hit Guam, the location of a major US military base and a critical node in the defense of the western Pacific Ocean. It isn't clear whether North Korea has the ability to put a nuclear warhead on the Musudan yet.\n\nThe ICBM would be the next level up, putting the continental US within Pyongyang's deadly reach. US four-star generals, including Gen. Vincent Brooks, who leads US forces in South Korea, and Adm. Harry Harris, head of US Pacific Command, say North Korea is nearing that capability. Other experts don't think Pyongyang is quite there yet, but say it likely will be within Trump's first term.\n\nStruggling to deliver nukes\n\nBruce Bennett, a\u00a0a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, says that despite North Korea's apparent progress on a warhead, it doesn't yet have good enough missile and rocket technology to deliver a nuke.\n\nA key question is whether they have the technology that would allow the missiles to re-enter the atmosphere. North Koreans have this capability for the intermediate range Musudan missile, which can hit South Korea and Japan. It's a harder technological feat to achieve re-entry capability for an ICBM, which is subject to higher temperatures and greater velocities.\n\nFor now, US military officials told CNN that they assess that North Korea still hasn't mastered that technology or key elements of firing and fuzing a weapon. \u00a0\n\n\"They're likely further along than many experts and pundits give them credit for,\" according to Klingner. \"We may not know where they are on that path, but we know they're on it.\"\n\n\u00a0Kim boasted in his New Year's remarks that his country has successfully tested a variety of ICBM technologies. \"Research and development of the cutting-edge tech weapons are actively progressing and strengthening our defense capabilities, including last-stage preparation of tests for intercontinental ballistic rocket launch have been continuously succeeding,\" he declared.\n\nIf the young leader goes ahead, an ICBM\u00a0test would be a flagrant violation of numerous United Nations resolutions and beg a response from Trump.\n\nThe President-elect has called Kim a \"maniac,\" but has also said he would sit down and negotiate with him, a break from long-standing international norms.\n\n\u00a0A test would also deepen worries in South Korea and Japan, already rattled by suggestions from candidate Trump that the US should cover less of their defense and,\u00a0 in another violation of international norms, that they should develop their own nuclear programs.\u00a0\n\nIncreasing tension with China\n\nAnd it would immediately increase tensions between the US and North Korea's closest ally China, which Trump has suggested has \"total control\" over Pyongyang.\n\nIf China won't rein North Korea in, Trump has suggested the US should \"make trade very difficult\" with Beijing. He has also suggested that he would have China assassinate the North Korean leader to make him \"disappear in one form or another very quickly.\"\u00a0\n\nCha said the decision to stop North Korea from reaching the point where it could deter the US by threatening Honolulu or Los Angeles with destruction will be a personal one that the President-elect will likely have to make. While some experts estimate Pyongyang will have an ICBM by 2020, Cha thinks it will be sooner.\n\n\"If the President decides this can't stand, then all kinds of options open up for him\" to take action, Cha said, including significant shifts in the US force posture in Asia and exerting greater pressure on China.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.29057598114014, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1394, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.2320706972099997, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170103010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.64992826398852, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/opinions/women-why-march-zito-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "What the Women's March was missing ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 972, "date": "20170123230000", "story_content": "What do women really want? \n\nIt's the age old question that came to a head once again on inaugural weekend when the day after President Donald Trump's inauguration, massive rallies were held in Washington and other cities across the country and around the world.\n\nBilled as the Women's March on Washington it was somewhat diverse, but was mostly filled with white women, many middle aged, many part of the feminist movement from the '70s who brought their daughters and granddaughters, with a serious amount of them dressed in bright pink vagina costumes, or pussycat pink knit caps. \n\nWhile everyone from the press to the President to the attendees obsessed about the sizes of the crowds, there was less attention paid to the serious, legitimate questions that still need to be answered, or at least addressed, in the aftermath of the march. \n\nThe message of the march was muddled, thorny and divisive. If this movement is to be successful where it counts, in local legislative races that eventually filter up to the federal level, there needs to be more cohesiveness and less exclusivity. The thing is, the movement has to decide what the movement is about, other than being against Trump. \n\nWas it a fight for equity and reproductive rights? Or was it an excuse to express dissatisfaction with the results of the presidential election? The latter is a question many people asked on social media.\n\nA Tweet by CBS News highlighting a speech from a former NAACP leader at the march featured a caption, \"We will march on 'til victory is won,\" which prompted a strong reaction from Resilient Patriot (aka Michael Flynn Jr.):\n\n\"What victory? Women already have equal rights, and YES equal pay in this country. What MORE do you want? Free mani/pedis? #WomensMarch\"\n\nHis tweet captured a hard truth: When it comes to reproductive rights, women's rights have come a long way. So has equal pay. The ability to serve on the front line in the military is now a reality and our country came within a hair of electing a women president; as her supporters and the media point out regularly, she won the popular vote. Women, all told, are doing well in America, a fact obscured by the images and rhetoric from the march.\n\nAccess to abortions has few barriers, the same for contraception. In fact, on Saturday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced New York's health insurers will now be mandated to cover a woman's initial three-month supply of contraception and then a supply for up to 12 months. \n\nAll \"medically necessary abortion services\" will also be covered by commercial health insurance policies without co-pays, coinsurance or deductibles.\n\nWhen it comes to displeasure with the election results, iconic feminist Gloria Steinem didn't even pretend to quell her sentiments. After speaking at the march, she told the press her message to President Trump was: \"It was time for him to leave\" the presidency, one day after being sworn in.\n\nThe march was also not inclusive. Feminists who were pro-life but supportive of social justice issues like gender equality and immigration rights were uninvited. Linda Sarsour, a Brooklyn-born Palestinian-American Muslim racial justice and civil-rights activist, told The New York Times, \"If you want to come to the march you are coming with the understanding that you respect a woman's right to choose.\" \n\nThat statement potentially left out one in six pro-life women who supported Hillary Clinton, according a Pew Research survey.  \n\nIt's important to get to the deepest question: Why march at all? What drew people to this event? Was it because women truly felt that their feminist goals aren't being addressed in culture, government and society? \n\nTwo women waiting for their delayed flight at Reagan National in Washington gently debated the ideals: a 46-year-old North Carolinian technology professional who was in the nation's capital for the inauguration, and a 61-year-old Californian who was there for the Women's March.\n\nTheir conversation was warm, curious and civil, but neither woman could reach a conclusion about what comes next.\n\nThe Californian, who works for a city government, admitted that in her workplace, she is paid the same amount as her male co-workers. \"But that wasn't always the case -- neither was the right to get an abortion,\" she said.\n\n\"Right,\" said the high-tech professional. \"You just made my point, it was the case, it isn't anymore,\" she said, adding that glass ceilings have opened up all across the nation, and that her daughter's abilities to achieve anything they want were proof of that. \n\nThe government worker interrupted, saying, \"But I am really worried that we might step backward under this president.\"\n\nThe North Carolinian, who said she considers herself a feminist, said even as a Trump supporter she would never let that happen under her watch. \"And I would have never voted for him if I ever believed that was the case,\" she added before asking the government worker if marching was more about not liking Trump winning the election.\n\n\"Oh, it has everything to do with it,\" she admitted. Then they both laughed. \n\nThe right to protest is as American as apple pie and baseball, but once the emotional high of the events are over, protesters, if rooted in true fundamental change, will then take their voice home and begin to get involved in grassroots local organizing around the issues they believe in. That type of change requires volunteerism and running for local office.\n\nIt's not an impossible quest; the country is filled on a very local level with people who identified with the tea party movement.\n\nBut protests need to have a core value, a single focus -- not an \"intersectionality.\" To make true change, it cannot be just about 'pussy' hats and vagina costumes.

Here's why:\n\n1. Who's the boss? \n\nChina and Taiwan both agree there is only one nation of China. But the jury is still out on who the legitimate ruler actually is. It has been this way since 1949 after the communists won the civil war and forced the nationalists, who previously ruled, to flee the mainland to the island of Taiwan. The communists set up a new government with the capital in Beijing, officially proclaiming the birth of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The nationalists set up their own government in Taiwan still officially known as the Republic of China (ROC). In practice, the PRC governs most of the Chinese territory and the ROC governs Taiwan and a few smaller islands near it. Most countries recognize the PRC as the legal ruler of all of China.\n\n2. Renegade province \n\nDespite having separate governments, China claims Taiwan is a renegade province. Taiwan runs itself like a country, having its own ministries and national and foreign policies separate from China. It even has formal diplomatic ties with 21 countries that officially recognize the ROC. But the ROC does not have nation status at the United Nations and most other international bodies.\n\n3. One-China Policy\n\nU.S. relations with China and Taiwan are governed by a set of protocols known as the One China Policy. In 1979, the US acknowledged the PRC's claim that there is one China and that Taiwan is part of China, when Washington severed ties with Taipei to recognize Beijing . The U.S. maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and posted \"unofficial\" representatives to Taipei. Until now, there have been no formal visits or official conversations between a U.S. president or president-elect and Taiwan's leaders. When Trump took Tsai's call, he broke this sensitive protocol.\n\n4. The political elephant in the room \n\nThe threat of a military conflict between China and Taiwan remains constant, for decades there were no communications, travel or trade between the two countries. Tensions began to ease in the 1990s when Beijing and Taipei reached an agreement to allow deliberate ambiguity on questions of sovereignty. This paved the way for economic and cultural cooperation. Since then, Taiwanese businesses have invested billions into the mainland and millions of Chinese tourists have visited Taiwan since the resumption of direct flights.\n\n \n\n5. China views Tsai's party warily \n\nChina fears, rightly or wrongly, that Tsai Ing-wen's Democratic Progress Party, is committed to declaring formal independence for Taiwan. The \"I\" word is something that China will never accept. Beijing insists Taiwan must be reunited with the mainland -- by force if necessary. Although Tsai has said she wants to preserve the status quo and not make any moves towards formal independence, her initiating a call to Trump, which the President-elect agreed to take could rub Beijing the wrong way.

Publisher Penguin told CNN it's ordered a larger-than-normal reprint of the book, but it's not the first time \"1984\" has seen a resurgence of interest or been used to warn about the state of the US government. Both Democrats and Republicans have invoked it, and it's been used to criticize George W. Bush's administration for actions following the 9/11 attack, Barack Obama's administration for the NSA, and now President Trump's. \n\nBelow are examples of how the novel's been referenced since 1949, showing an evolution in its political usage, from vague allusions to government overreach, to debates about mass government surveillance.\n\n1949:\n\n\"1984\" was published in 1949, just four years after the end of World War II and at the dawn of the Cold War. Time magazine's review of the novel noted, \"any reader in 1949 can uneasily see his own shattered features in Winston Smith, can scent in the world of 1984 a stench that is already familiar.\"\n\n1977:\n\nIn Virginia, state Sen. Omer Hirst, a Democrat, used the novel in his defense of legislation that would legalize a larger number of beers for sale statewide, saying, \"the theme of '1984' is pervasive government control, which is what this bill will diminish,\" according to a Washington Post article that March.\n\n1983:\n\nOn the eve of the actual 1984, a CNN report looked at how Americans felt about government surveillance. A Harris poll found 84% of American believed the US government \"may use television to document compromising activities,\" and 70% believed it would \"use confidential information to intimidate.\"\n\n1984:\n\nDuring a debate over a New York state law requiring front-seat drivers and passengers to wear a seat belt, the first law of its kind in the country, opponents held up copies of \"1984\" and, \"suggested the law was a \"Big Brother\" tactic,\" according to a New York Times article that December.\n\n2003:\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore accused President George W. Bush of using the war on terror to \"rule by secrecy and unquestioned authority\" at a meeting for Moveon.org and the American Constitution Society. \"They have taken us much farther down the road toward an intrusive, Big Brother-style government -- toward the dangers prophesied by George Orwell in his book '1984' --- than anyone ever thought would be possible in the United States of America.\"\n\n2013:\n\nEdward Snowden, speaking to UK's Channel 4 on Christmas said, \"The types of collection in the [\"1984\"] -- microphones and video cameras, TVs that watch us -- are nothing compared to what we have available today. ... We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go. Think about what this means for the privacy of the average person.\"\n\n2016:\n\nJust last year, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, called the Obama administration's decision to strike the Orlando shooter's pledge of allegiance to ISIS from transcripts of 9/11 calls \"an action that would make George Orwell proud,\" and Rep. Tony Cardenas, D-California, said the Share Act, legislation about firearms, hunting, and fishing, \"most closely resembles George Orwell's novel \"1984,\" riddled with double speak and other provisions.\"\n\nAlso in 2016, Chief Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg participated in a mock trial over \"1984.\"\n\n\"If war is peace then we are in peace time and there is no excuse for any of these extraordinary measures,\" she said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.62776017189026, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 562, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.30701409826, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.20284697508897, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/27/opinions/cant-stop-checking-our-emails-schulte-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Why you can't stop checking your email", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1267, "date": "20170127230000", "story_content": "We're drowning in email. We check it incessantly -- more than half of American workers check email at least once an hour. And at night. And on weekends. And on vacation.\n\nThe compulsion to constantly check, respond, clean out and keep on top of an overflowing inbox is actually making us stressed out, distracted, miserable and sick.\n\nSo sick that on January 1, a \"right to disconnect from email\" law went into effect in France as a way to reduce worker stress and burnout and improve quality of life.\n\nBut what if the ability to disconnect has less to do with legislation and more with our often irrational human psychology?\n\nIf you believe, as the French government does, that work-obsessed bosses and demanding work cultures are what drive people to stay tethered to the \"electronic leash\" of the office, \"like a dog,\" as one member of parliament put it, then passing a law requiring companies to negotiate new limits on after-hours email makes sense.\n\nAnd it's true, a manager who emails at all hours and expects a reply -- or who doesn't make clear that they don't -- is sending a powerful signal that they value working all the time. Research into work-life stress has found, not surprisingly, that workers will sometimes get up in the middle of the night to send an email with a late time stamp, so their workaholic bosses will think they, too, are working late into the night. \n\nSo you'd think that if top managers sent a very different signal -- a series of emails, say, reminding workers that the offices will be closed and to enjoy their vacation -- workers would be able to unplug, right?\n\nTo find out, ideas42, a nonprofit that uses behavioral science to understand and design solutions to thorny social problems -- including a current project on work-life conflict that the Better Life Lab is a partner on -- decided to run an experiment over the winter holiday, using themselves as guinea pigs.\n\nIdeas42 bills itself as having a \"supportive\" work culture, where the value of work-life balance and time to rest and recharge is made clear. And prior to the break, top managers sent out several emails reminding its 74 employees in New York, Boston and Washington that the offices would be closed for the week.\n\nDan Connolly, a senior associate, wanted to see if those were strong enough signals to get everyone to disconnect. He figured they might be. \n\nPlus, the fact that everyone would be off at the same time and encouraged to unplug could create a strong \"network effect.\" Humans are social creatures, he explained. We're influenced by what others in our social networks do, and we feel most comfortable when we conform to the social norms around us. When a single worker takes vacation in the summer while everyone else is working, their discomfort from deviating from that norm can drive them to guiltily check email and stay connected.\n\nWith the office closed and everyone off, Connolly figured the new norm would make checking email uncomfortable, so people would be more likely to disconnect.\n\nExcept they didn't. Not entirely.\n\nThe result was \"mixed success,\" Connolly said after analyzing the firm's server logs. The amount of email traffic definitely dropped, especially on the holiday weekends. But it never quite consistently flatlined the way Connolly was hoping.\n\n\"It seems we have more to learn about how to truly encourage people to disconnect,\" Connolly wrote in a recent blog post.\n\nThe question is, why can't we seem to rein ourselves in when it comes to email? And, other than enforcing a law, how do we stop?\n\nOur brains are wired to constantly seek novelty, and every new email that lands in our inbox with a ping sends a dopamine-fueled shiver of excitement through our cerebrum. Turning off notifications and setting and communicating clear email rules in workplaces and after hours can disrupt that addictive dopamine loop. \n\nBut behavioral science would suggest there's more than just neurotransmitters at work. \n\nConnolly attributes some of the inability to unplug to the psychology of the human ego. We often overestimate how vital we are at work, he said. And we often don't see how our actions affect others.\n\nFor instance, on the first day of vacation, Connolly's own priority was to clear out his inbox so he could feel good about disconnecting. \"But then I'm making it hard for other people to do the same thing. I close something on my end, but what I've actually done is make it pop up in three other people's email. And we're all doing that to each other.\"\n\nThinking about how your choices impact others, and taking their perspective into account, can help counter such egocentrism. That, and perhaps investing in good technology, like Boomerang, that enables you to write your email to get it out of your head and inbox, but schedule it to go out during office hours.\n\nAnother factor that may be driving our inability to disconnect is the peak-end rule, whereby people tend to judge an experience based on what it felt like at its most intense point and at the end. In other words, what we remember most about our inbox is just how awful it feels to face all those unanswered emails -- that endless, running to-do list of other people's priorities -- that have piled up while we were away. So we keep checking just to avoid that pain.\n\nAgain, technology could help -- having all emails sent into a specific folder while you're away, rather than to your inbox, could make returning feel less overwhelming. Creating a workplace that allows for time to ease back into work, rather than plunge in at full speed, could also make reentry less painful, and disconnecting feel less impossible.\n\nAnother factor could be our human predilection for making decisions based on short-term payoffs, like deciding to fall back into a warm bed in the morning rather than get up and exercise.\n\n\"We love to get things 'done,'\" explained Iris Bohnet, a behavioral economist at the Harvard Kennedy School. \"Email is terrible for that. If you only respond to these 10 emails, it feels like an accomplishable task.\"\n\nTo counter such present-biased preference, Bohnet suggests creating commitment devices with co-workers or managers, such as agreeing to check emails in batches at specific times, rather than continuously.\n\nIronically, if we did stop checking email, we really wouldn't miss that much. In a survey, Daniel Ariely, professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke, found that only 11% of the emails in our inboxes require immediate attention. The other 89% can wait.\n\nThat's a lesson Richard Sheridan, chief executive of the software company Menlo Innovations, told me he learned the hard way. Sheridan created a work culture that discourages long hours and checking emails and calls after hours so workers will be rested and refreshed when they come in in the morning. He once chastised an employee for checking her email from Hong Kong, when she was supposed to be on vacation. Yet he himself, an \"inbox zero\" fanatic, has had a hard time disconnecting. \n\nBefore a recent vacation, an assistant promised to handle his inbox so he wouldn't have to come back to an avalanche of nagging, unanswered emails. When he returned, he was shocked to find there were only 18 that truly required his attention.\n\n\"Email is one of those tip-of-the-iceberg indicators\" that we all operate in a culture that has come to value work and busyness above all else. Sheridan said. \"The real underlying problems go much deeper.\"\n\nAnd that will take more than a law to fix.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone":

"story_content": "When I fled Vietnam as a child, I never imagined that the islands we attempted our escapes from would one day become luxurious beach resorts.  \n\nBut more than 30 years later, that's exactly what's happening around Nha Trang, a seaside town where I grew up about 200 miles north of Saigon (or Ho Chi Minh City) that's become a small hub for island getaways in Vietnam. \n\nIf you love finding a piece of tropical paradise as much as I do, Vietnam has some beautiful and intriguing offerings in Nha Trang and beyond, including islands that were once used to lock up prisoners.  \n\nMORE: World's best islands\n\nThe rise of Nha Trang\n\nOn the south central coast of Vietnam, where the temperature is hot year round, Nha Trang has long been a popular vacation spot for locals. \n\nBut in the 1990s, when Vietnam opened its doors to the outside world again, Nha Trang began attracting international travelers seeking a beach break between Saigon and Hanoi. \n\nPalm tree shaded beaches, striking ancient temples, cheap hotels, fresh seafood grilled right on the beach, mind-numbing booze cruises for just a few bucks and a lively bar scene where locals, expats and tourists happily mingled at oceanfront places like the Sailing Club made Nha Trang a fun place to party and relax. \n\nAfter nearly 10 years since my last visit, I returned to Nha Trang last February for Tet, the Lunar New Year holiday. \n\nI was overwhelmed by all the changes.\n\nFirst there was the landing in the reconstructed Cam Ranh International Airport about 20 miles from Nha Trang, a facility built by the Americans during the war as part of a large military base and later also used by the Russian Air Force. \n\nAll around me, I heard Chinese and Russian being spoken. \n\nNow with reasonably-priced direct flights from Moscow and Guangzhou, Nha Trang has become a hot spot for Russians and Chinese looking to escape winter.\n\nMORE: A journey up Vietnam's red river\n\nNha Trang luxury \n\nLike much of Vietnam, this once laid back city has gone through a hotel-building frenzy with no signs of stopping, including some high-end luxury options.  \n\nBig chains like the Sheraton and resorts like Mia and Amanoi are already catering to Nha Trang's more upscale market. \n\nIf budget is not an issue and you want indulgence and seclusion, Six Senses Ninh Van Bay offers villas with private pools, starting at $600 dollars per night. \n\nThe resort is not on an island per se, but rather nestled on the remote Ninh Van Bay surrounded by majestic mountains, a 20-minute boat ride from Nha Trang. \n\nA spa, tennis, water-skiing, hiking and even cooking classes are available at the resort. \n\nWhale Island\n\nNha Trang is a vibrant city but it can get crowded and hectic, especially during the holidays. \n\nFor unspoiled beaches and peace and quiet, it's best to hop to a nearby island. \n\nOn the more affordable end is Whale Island, an eco-friendly resort with basic amenities just a two-hour boat ride from Nha Trang. \n\nI explored the island when it first opened years ago and fondly recall how pristine and stunning it was. \n\nThe resort has since updated and expanded its facilities but has kept its no parties, no noise, no frills vibe. \n\nThere's an abundance of activities for nature and water sport lovers, including diving, snorkeling, sailing and kayaking. \n\nMORE: The world's 100 best beaches\n\nHon Tre Island\n\nIf you're traveling with kids and beaches aren't enough to keep them entertained, there's Vinpearl Land on Hon Tre Island. \n\nVietnam's version of Disney World also has a water park, aquarium and clear, calm beach, all in one place for about $30 dollars admission per person.\n\nJust bear in mind this is Vietnam, not Florida. \n\nGuests coming in from the mainland can take the ferry or ride a scenic 3-kilometer cable car over the ocean. \n\nVinpearl has a resort on a separate part of the island complete with a lush 18-hole golf course designed by IMG Worldwide. \n\nMORE: 10 dishes every Vietnam visitor needs to try\n\nPhu Quoc and Con Dao\n\nThe Nha Trang area isn't the only option for island hopping in the south. \n\nAbout an hour flight from Saigon, Phu Quoc and Con Dao were both used as prison islands during French colonial times and the Vietnam War. \n\nThe Phu Quoc Prison museum is worth a visit for those wanting to learn more about the area's past.  \n\nThese days, Phu Quoc -- situated between the Vietnam mainland and Cambodia -- is on some travelers' lists as the island to visit in Southeast Asia. \n\nBest of all, international tourists flying directly to the island only no longer require a visa.\n\nBefore Phu Quoc became a tourist destination, its claim to fame was fish sauce. \n\nProduced on the island, it's considered the best in the world and an essential ingredient in Vietnamese cooking. \n\nThe island has come a long way since the late 1990s when I first visited and fell in love with the place. \n\nBack then, there was no international airport or real hotels, only a few guesthouses. \n\nIn fact, 20 years ago, a British expat living in Saigon enjoyed the island so much but couldn't find adequate accommodation that he and a few partners built some bungalows. \n\nThose bungalows became Mango Bay, an unpretentious resort offering rustic villas in a spacious natural setting. \n\nThere are plenty of other hotels and resorts to choose from on the island, and big names like the J.W. Marriott are currently under construction. \n\nLocated on the south coast, JW Marriott Phu Quoc Emerald Bay was designed by legendary resort architect Bill Bensley and is due to open in late 2017. \n\nThe small island of Con Dao, while developing nowhere near the pace of Phu Quoc, may be the next frontier for Vietnam island hoppers charmed by the idea of exploring a beautiful place before the rest of the world moves in. \n\nDiving here is said to be the best in Vietnam. \n\nThere's no international airport and accommodation is limited, with a Six Senses property and the newly opened Poulo Condor Resort on the more luxury end.  \n\nThese islands, much like Vietnam's history, are a story of rebirth and reinvention, highlighting its ability to rebound from the dust of war.\n\nIn the end, natural beauty prevails.\n\nMORE: Saigon street food: What to eat in Ho Chi Minh City\n\nThe resorts\n\nSheraton Nha Trang Hotel & Spa, 26-28 Tran Phu Street, Nha Trang, +84 (0)58 3880 000\n\nMia Resort Nha Trang, 3 Khuc Thua Du, Phuong Phuoc Long, Nha Trang, +84 (0) 583 989 666 \n\nAmanoi, Vinh Hy Village, Vinh Hai Commune,Ninh Hai, +84 (0)68 3770 777\n\nSix Senses Ninh Van Bay, Ninh Van, Ninh Hoa, +84 (0)58 3728 222\n\nWhale Island Resort, Dam Mon, Van Thanh, Van Ninh, Khanh Hoa, +84 (0)58 3707 118 \n\nMango Bay Resort, Cua Du\u01a1ng, Phu Quoc, Kien Giang, +84 (0)77 3981 693\n\nSix Senses Con Dao, Dat Doc Beach, Con Dao Dist, Con Son, +84 (0)64 3831 222\n\nPoulo Condor Resort and Spa, Con Son, +84 (0)8 3822 3625", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.69058299064636, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1032, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.1354541815299999, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161219030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.7751937984496121, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/12/opinions/russia-role-shocking-but-not-hacked-douglas/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Russia's role is shocking but there's no evidence the vote was hacked", "wordcount_as_scraped": 811, "date": "20161213000000", "story_content": "The revelations that Russia actively sought to influence the American election and help Donald Trump become the next president are shocking, mind-blowing and downright scary. But here is something they are not:  evidence that the Russians hacked voting machines or changed the Election Day count. Unsubstantiated assertions that Russia actually manipulated the vote tally are themselves dangerous.\n\nNews reports have said that the CIA concluded Russia sought to influence the election result, particularly by providing WikiLeaks with emails that Russia obtained by hacking the servers of the Democratic National Committee and Democratic individuals. \n\nThe Russians may still be holding onto information they hacked from the RNC servers. These facts, which the intelligence community knew about even before the election, should send shivers down the spines of all Americans. They are what prompted a bipartisan group in Congress, as well as Hillary Clinton spokesman John Podesta, to demand further investigation and public disclosure of what exactly Russia did to influence the campaign. Understanding what happened is vitally important, so the intelligence community should act quickly to assuage Americans' concerns.\n\nBut saying that Russia sought to influence the campaign and help Trump's chances is not the same as saying that Russia actually manipulated the voting process. \n\nIndeed, the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration have both said that they do not have any evidence that Russia hacked voting machines or altered voting technology. A federal judge, in rejecting Jill Stein's lawsuit seeking a statewide recount in Pennsylvania, also pointed to a lack of evidence of election machine hacking.\n\nHere is why that matters: Unless and until we have actual evidence of voting manipulation, it undermines the legitimacy of our electoral system to suggest something was amiss based on sheer speculation. And it could cause politicians to adopt laws in the name of \"election integrity\" that will actually harm the fundamental right to vote.\n\nThis speculation is much the same as the frenzy over voter fraud that has no evidence to back it up, with significant consequences for our elections. Republicans for years have argued that concerns of voter fraud support strict voter ID measures, even though there is virtually no evidence that in-person impersonation occurs to any significant degree. \"Voter fraud is difficult to detect,\" they may respond, \"so why not do something to improve the integrity of our elections?\" The consequence, however, of a voter ID law is that thousands of people will have a harder time voting. \n\nMere speculation that the Russians hacked our voting machines could also lead to calls for election integrity measures that could have negative effects. Indeed, Donald Trump has already signaled his belief, without any evidence, that there were \"millions of illegal votes\" and that he wants to reconsider certain voter-friendly measures such as early voting. \n\nUnsubstantiated claims of election machine hacking could, for example, embolden Trump and his supporters to call for a reduction of early voting because they fear voting machines are not secure. At least so far, however, there is absolutely no evidence of election machine hacking by Russia or anyone else.\n\nOf course, it would be great if these allegations prompted reform where we actually need it: updating our aging voting equipment. States and localities must provide the resources to improve our voting technology, especially to ensure a verified paper trail to improve the post-election process. We should also institute more widespread and routine audits after the election. The claims of Russian hacking -- whether substantiated or not -- should create the impetus for these reforms, which will benefit all voters.\n\nBut the concern is that unsupported allegations will create an environment in which politicians use the frenzy of election hacking claims to push through measures that will disenfranchise voters. We are already seeing this happen in Michigan. Stein sought a recount of the presidential election in the state largely because of concerns about the reliability of the result and speculation of possible tampering, which in turn caused Michigan Republicans to push a new strict voter ID bill. \n\nAs one Michigan legislator noted, \"This lemon of a recount may turn into lemonade from the standpoint of helping us firm up the integrity of the voting process.\" The general speculation about \"election integrity,\" without any actual evidence to support it, is thus emboldening Michigan Republicans to enact a law that will have negative effects on the right to vote.\n\nIf reliable evidence does come out showing the Russians hacked our voting machines in addition to seeking to influence the campaign, then we should certainly take appropriate corrective action. And even without that evidence, we should improve our voting technology to ensure no one can alter our Election Day process in the future. But we should also be careful about claiming the Russians actually changed the vote count without evidence. Sowing unsubstantiated doubt about \"election integrity\" could have negative consequences for how we administer our elections.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.20932865142822, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 831, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.42575710257, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 6, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.2490974729241904, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/15/health/babies-three-people-embryos/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 783, "scraper_regex": 855}}, "headline": "'Three-parent' babies approved in the UK", "wordcount_as_scraped": 855, "date": "20161215180000", "story_content": "The UK's fertility regulator has given the green light to a treatment that will make it possible for babies to be made from two women and a man. The new advancement in in vitro fertilization, developed by doctors in Newcastle, is intended to prevent children being born with certain fatal genetic diseases.\n\nThe first child to be born in the UK through the new method could arrive by the end of 2017.\n\nThe procedure will allow the donation of mitochondria, which provides energy for cells, to mothers with mutations within the DNA of their own mitochondria so they do not pass the mutations on to their child.\n\nReplacing your mitochondria\n\nMitochondrial diseases are genetic conditions; about one in 4,300 affected children are estimated to be born with these conditions every year. Mitochondria provide humans with energy and are present in almost every cell within the body.\n\nKnown as \"mitochondrial donation,\" the IVF technique involves replacing faulty mitochondria inherited from the mother with the healthy mitochondria of another woman.\n\nMost of a cell's genetic material, or DNA, is contained within the nucleus, but a very small amount (less than 1%) is found in the mitochondria.\n\nThis mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother through her eggs.\n\nIf the mother's mitochondrial DNA is faulty, it is possible that she may pass on a number of rare but very serious mitochondrial diseases, including muscle weakness, diabetes, heart problems, epilepsy and stroke-like episodes. In serious cases, they can lead to death. \n\nAbout 1 in 6,500 children are thought to develop a serious mitochondrial disorder, according to Newcastle's Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research, which has been a leading partner in the project.\n\nA historic decision\n\n\"Today's historic decision means that parents at very high risk of having a child with a life-threatening mitochondrial disease may soon have the chance of a healthy, genetically related child,\" said Sally Cheshire, Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority chairwoman. \"This is life-changing for those families.\"\n\nAn expert panel reviewed the development, safety and efficacy of these techniques over five years and four reports, she added, saying the authority feels that \"now it is the right time to carefully introduce this new treatment in the limited circumstances recommended by the panel.\"\n\nMoving forward has been approved, but caution is still recommended.\n\n\"Although it is tempting to rush ahead with new treatments, the UK approach of testing public opinion, putting the issue to Parliament and carefully monitoring laboratory research has proved to be the most responsible and sustainable of introducing new, cutting-edge treatments into the clinic,\" Cheshire said. \"Such an approach has allowed us to balance innovation with safety, maintaining public trust as we go.\" \n\nIn February 2015, UK lawmakers voted in favor of a law that would allow the pioneering technique using DNA from three people.\n\nThe Newcastle team aims to offer treatment for up to 25 women a year affected by mitochondrial disease, but the treatment could be held back if they don't have enough healthy donated eggs.\n\nPlaying catch-up\n\nThe UK is probably not the first country in the world to have children born through the three-person technique.\n\nA Jordanian couple and doctors in New York claimed they performed the procedure in Mexico, with the child being born on April 6.\n\nThe use of this reproductive technology was originally intended to prevent Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological condition that affects at least one in 40,000 newborns. \n\nThe mother in this historic case previously had four pregnancy losses and had given birth to two children, one of whom survived less than a year and another who lived only six years, both due to this syndrome.\n\nFor religious reasons, the mother wanted to use a technique that would not require the destruction of a fertilized egg. A team of doctors, led by Dr. John Zhang, founder of the New Hope Fertility Center in New York City, went to Mexico to perform the procedure, as it is not licensed in the US.\n\nBut the UK may now see many babies being born through the method in the coming years.\n\n\"Mitochondrial donation offers a real opportunity to cure a class of potentially devastating inherited conditions and will bring hope to hundreds of affected families in the UK,\" said Dr. Dagan Wells, associate professor at the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at the University of Oxford. \"Research teams, such as those of Professors Herbert and Turnbull in Newcastle, have done sterling work to assess safety of methods for replacing defective mitochondria, and their research has provided much reassurance in that regard. \n\n\"The HFEA's decision to allow clinics to apply for permission to perform mitochondrial donation finally opens the way to begin using this technology for the benefit of families that have faced much heartbreak and hardship as a result of carrying a mitochondrial disorder.\"\n\n\"This marks a momentous and historic step, and we hope families next year will begin their journey to eradicate these genetic diseases,\" added Dr. Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society. \"Clinics will now need to apply for a license, and the regulator will grant them, taking into account each application extremely carefully.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.11918950825929599, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 783, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.209395237380001, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 6, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161215180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.08684546615581, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/13/opinions/a-latino-leaders-advice-to-president-elect-trump-ruiz/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1227, "scraper_regex": 1293}}, "headline": "President-elect Trump, you can reboot your relationship with Latinos ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1293, "date": "20161113130000", "story_content": "Dear President-elect Trump,\n\nOver the course of this election cycle, I actively and strongly opposed you for saying and inciting things that I deemed detrimental against Latinos. This week, following your electoral victory, you said you wanted to become known as a president that unites our nation and that you aim to be everybody's president. \n\nToday I want to say that I am personally giving you a clean slate to reboot your relationship with the Latino community after what everyone can agree has been the most toxic election cycle in recent political memory.  \n\nAs an American of Cuban Latino descent (yes, I am ALL THREE and not just one!) who is married to a Mexican-American, I want you to know that I want you to be super successful because your success would mean our nation is thriving and uniting.  \n\nMany of my friends in the communities of color I represent are gravely concerned about your presidency and whether this means you will use your presidential powers to strip our communities of our dignity and our rights, but I believe you have the opportunity to be successful and to win the whole nation over.  \n\nI can't say it's going to be easy. It's going to take guts to make inroads into our communities but that's one trait we all know you have. The fact that you almost single-handedly won this election without any of the traditional establishments of politics and media in your corner tells me that you can make unconventional, practical decisions and that many of your followers will listen.\n\nIn the spirit of unity, here are some ways you can be true to those who elected you while ALSO building bridges to many people of color:   \n\nLet Hillary go\n\nIf you want to unite the nation, come out quickly saying your administration is not going to prosecute Secretary Clinton. Pursuing a criminal case against Hillary will instantly turn into the kind of political drama you don't want or need in your first days in office and the best part about this idea is that you have a Republican political precedent for this: Ford pardoned Nixon after the Watergate scandal for the sake of moving the country forward. \n\nBuild the wall but create a path for citizenship for undocumented Latinos \n\nThis idea is very controversial for both border-obsessed conservatives and Latino progressives, but in many ways it is the perfect middle ground. If your administration moves forward with rumored deportations and no path to citizenship for undocumented Latinos -- who, in many cases, have been living here for years -- the human and psychological toll this will take on our community will be great. This is the No. 1 apocalyptic fear Latinos see with your presidency.\n\nI want to appeal to you to consider the legacy of Ronald Reagan, the same president who you say you admired and whose campaign also inspired your slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nReagan endeared himself to millions of Latinos when he authorized a path to citizenship for them in the early '80s, and I am certain that over the course of your presidency you and your Republican Party can take action on the immigration issue to convert many Latinos to your party, accomplishing something your Democratic counterparts never did.\n\nIt is reasonable to say that this path should not be available for undocumented Hispanics who committed any crimes, that criminals be immediately deported and that citizenship include some of the bipartisan fines and timelines that have previously been discussed by members of both parties in Congress.\n\nIn this context, if you build the wall that you promised your voters you would create, it will have been built for people who have not yet tried to cross the border and will not impact families that right now could feel totally displaced.  \n\nCreate a national task force to address police brutality \n\nThose of us who have family who work in the line of duty know that the overwhelming majority of police officers are good people with dangerous jobs. Police work is violent and volatile, and it is wrong to demonize the professionals who sacrifice their lives daily to serve and to protect.\n\nThat said, there are some rogue cops who are literally getting away with murdering unarmed African-Americans, and the black and Latino communities are justifiably hurting and angry.\n\nMr. Trump, Rudy Giuliani is a specialist in making communities safer and stronger. It would be impressive for someone like Giuliani to be the one who initiates the dialogue with the African-American community and who, together with minority communities, police leaders and the Justice Department, establishes new standards that improve what is now a very volatile situation.\n\nBring people of color into your administration \n\nAmerica is a diverse nation and you yourself have said that you have a history of employing many people of color. Make your administration one that is inclusive with political outsiders and insiders alike that reflect our diversity and can inform your ideas and policies.\n\nI am not saying this because it is the politically correct thing to do. I am saying this because it is the right, smart and truly unifying thing to do. It will also boost your party's position at a time when many people of color are convinced Republicans don't want to be inclusive.\n\nActively engage Latino and African American media\n\nIt is 100% true that both media and social media organizations from diverse communities vehemently opposed you. Rehashing why and what happened is pointless on both sides of this situation. As a leader in the Hispanic and multicultural media industry I urge you to reach out to us and meet us so we can build a dialogue that is productive and unifying. People like me will probably not see eye to eye with you on everything you'd like us to, but I am convinced that over time we can find a way to agree to disagree.\n\nProactively disavow people who hate people of color\n\nIn every community and political party there are always going to be weirdos and haters. In this election, we unfortunately saw those like David Duke and the KKK who openly and stridently embraced your candidacy. We know you did not ask for their endorsement and that in fact you later condemned them, but in the future, please consider doing so more quickly.\n\nAlso think about how you can use your words (or Twitter!) to indicate your support for our nation's diverse communities, including Muslim-Americans. It may seem trivial, but it is not. These are the optics by which our communities of color interpret where you stand in relation to us. Racism is real.\n\nDon't give up\n\nFinally, please know that the post-election wounds and fears our communities of color feel are raw and real. Even writing this open letter to you can get me in trouble because many of us right now are blinded by our fears.\n\nSome protests and even civil disturbances are going to ensue in the coming days or weeks purely based on things you said or did during the campaign.

The team also asked Interior several questions, including how much wall would be needed, in an effort to determine a solid number of miles of wall necessary to secure the southern border.  \n\nThe moves by the transition team, including previously reported questions to the Department of Homeland Security, show how seriously Trump is taking his promise to build a massive physical barrier between the US and Mexico. The idea energized backers at this rallies but was dismissed by opponents as expensive and unfeasible.  \n\nTrump was loud and clear in his first news conference since being elected that he wants to move quickly on the wall.\n\n\"It's not a fence. It's a wall,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"We'll start immediately after we get to office; I don't want to wait.\"\n\nVice President-elect Mike Pence had started efforts to get clearances from Congress and agencies to begin construction of the wall, Trump said.\n\nThis outreach provides a window into how the Trump team -- which did not respond to a request for comment on this story -- is thinking about making the wall a reality.\n\nThe official told CNN it appeared transition officials were feeling out \"what kind of regulatory barriers are in the way so they could possibly get rid of them.\"   \n\nThere are local, state and federal laws on the books that would protect endangered species and air and water quality. But one environmental law expert says what the Trump transition team could end up using language in the REAL ID Act that Congress passed in 2005. The law includes a provision that allows the secretary of Homeland Security the power to waive all local, state and federal laws that the secretary determines is an obstacle to building walls and roads along US borders. \n\nThe Sierra Club said the law allows DHS to waive more than 30 federal laws \"in their entirety.\" Some of those federal environmental laws include the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, National Historic Preservation Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Clean Air Act and the Archaeological Resources Protection Act. \n\nIn 2008 Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff invoked that power to waive environmental laws to construct barriers along portions of the southern border. \n\nMelinda Taylor, an environmental law professor with the University of Texas, said the George W. Bush-era law is a powerful tool. \n\n\"The new administration has a wild card they can pull and it's in this law,\" Taylor said. \"The language in this law allows them to waive all federal laws that would be an impediment to building any type of physical barrier along the border, including a wall.\" \n\nNone of this addresses the projected multibillion-dollar cost of the wall. Congress would still have to approve funding to construct the wall, and Trump has promised he will get Mexico to eventually pay for the project. But removing some potential environmental legal fights could speed things up. \n\nA third US official told CNN the Department of Homeland Security has been preparing for a scenario where they are told a wall along the southern border must be built. \n\n\"The moment Donald Trump won the election, DHS started discussions about how to achieve a wall if tasked to help make it happen. Those conversations included determining where to start erecting the wall first and identifying the priority areas along the border,\" the source told CNN.  \n\nTaylor said if the new administration waives all federal laws that are intended to protect the environment and historic preservation \"it will be particularly tragic.\"  \n\n\"If they really try to build a wall, without regard for environmental laws and without environmental impact statements, the effect of a border wall would be more catastrophic than a border fence,\" she said.\n\nA wall would prevent water from flowing across the Mexican border, and there is also wildlife that migrates across the border, including the endangered ocelot, also known as a dwarf leopard, located in south Texas and northern Mexico, she said. \n\n\"US Fish and Wildlife has spent a lot of money to preserve this animal and there are only a couple dozen left,\" Taylor added.\n\nMany other endangered species live along the border in California and Arizona as well. There is also the issue of Native American territory and private land that straddles the border as well as the historic preservation of potential archeological artifacts in the area. \n\nTaylor is urging the new administration to do the impact studies so that \"they have the data about the potential impact of a wall and find ways to minimize the impact.\" ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.6465517282485961, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 876, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.8440680930699997, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.2237442922374395, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/26/asia/philippines-typhoon-nock-ten-nina/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Typhoon Nock-ten strands thousands in Philippines", "wordcount_as_scraped": 541, "date": "20161226110000", "story_content": "Super Typhoon Nock-ten has left more than 11,000 travelers stranded after roaring into the Philippines and forcing the closure of ports in the Southeast Asian country.\n\nThe typhoon, known locally as Nina, made landfall over Bato in the province of Catanduanes at 8 p.m. local time (7 a.m. ET) on Christmas day. \n\nAuthorities rushed to evacuate thousands of residents from low-lying areas of the eastern Philippines ahead of Nock-ten's arrival and the provinces of Catanduanes and Albay were declared under a \"state of imminent danger/disaster.\"\n\nSome 11,476 passengers, more than 1,000 cargo ships and over a dozen other vessels were stranded in various ports in the region, the Philippines National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported Sunday.\n\nPhilippines Coast Guard spokesman Armand Balilo told CNN the storm had forced various ports to temporarily close.

The warning signal, the second-highest level on the scale of alerts, indicates the storm could cause \"heavy damage\" to high-risk structures. Rice, corn and coconut plantations will likely suffer severe losses.\n\nA storm surge height of up to 2.5 meters is possible over the coastal areas of Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Albay, Sorsogon and Catanduanes, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).\n\nPAGASA reported that the typhoon would cause moderate to heavy rainfall in a 500-kilometer (311-mile) radius.\n\nThere were fears that Nock-ten could potentially bring flooding to the capital, Manila -- one of the most densely populated urban centers of the country.\n\nMeantime, hospitals throughout the Philippines -- private and public -- are under a \"code white alert,\" meaning leave has been canceled for surgeons, emergency room staff and thosespecializing in trauma and injury,\" Department of Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial said. \n\nThe Philippines has been battered by devastating typhoons in recent years, most notably Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 -- considered to be among the strongest storms to make landfall.

But at what cost?\n\nThe Republican nominee just pulled off one of the greatest upsets in political history to take back the White House. He managed to flip Rust Belt blue states red and in doing so, helped the GOP retain its majorities in Congress. As a Republican, I should be overjoyed. But as an American first, my heart is heavy. Why? Because that nominee, now President-elect, is Donald Trump. \n\nYes, we \"won,\" but at what cost? Was it worth overlooking bigotry, integrity, mistreatment of women, dishonesty, demagoguery and common decency to sell our political souls for the prospect of a few policy victories?\n\nBoth candidates suffered from considerable character deficits. But the American people, fed up with politics as usual, threw caution to the wind and chose change. Was that choice driven more by validation of Trump or a repudiation of Clinton? How do we explain that decision to our children?\n\nHillary Clinton deserved to lose. She was a terrible candidate saddled by legitimate questions of honesty, trustworthiness and political corruption brought on by her own poor judgment. \n\nAs a result, Trump was able to execute the greatest con in US history. His self-indulgent reality show just became real life. He can no longer hide behind his gold plated veneer of \"telling it like it is.\" He must transition from platitudes to policy implementation. In other words, he must govern.\n\nAs we pick up the pieces, we need to ask ourselves who we've become as a country. How do we heal the divide? Can Donald Trump rise to the occasion and lead this great nation? I still have my reservations, but for the sake of our constitutional republic, I hope he can. \n\nTara Setmayer is former communications director for Rep.

From day one of his campaign, when he denigrated Mexicans and immigrants, Donald Trump has made this election, in part, a referendum on our community. Consider all the times that Latinos have figured into the campaigns, from \"bad hombres\" to Miss Universe to \"taco trucks on every corner.\" We now know that a huge number of American voters are untroubled enough by his xenophobia and bigotry that they were willing to hand the keys to the White House to a reality TV star.\n\nWhat has been truly lost in this personality-driven race is a serious discussion of major issues. Too often, the race devolved into personal insults and attacks. The media was complicit in this, too often setting aside the astonishing possibility of Russia meddling in our electoral process to breathlessly cover the latest Trump rally.   \n\nThe surge in Latino early voting was apparently not enough to fend off the visceral appeal of Trump's promises of change. Latinos can take pride in the uptick in our turnout, from Nevada to Florida, and in the election of the first Latina to the U.S. Senate, Catherine Cortez Masto.  \n\nBut undeniably, this is a dark day for US Latinos. Everything from the Affordable Care Act, which has enabled millions of Latinos to obtain health coverage, to marriage equality, which is supported by a majority of Latinos, is now in jeopardy. Our undocumented friends, family, and neighbors are living with fear -- as are millions of Latinos rightly concerned about the possible rollback of our civil rights by Republicans controlling both the executive and the legislative branch. \n\nOne of the broader questions surrounding this presidential race, often posed by the Clinton campaign, was \"What kind of country do we want to be?\" Sadly, that question has been answered.   \n\nRaul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of USA Today's board of contributors, writes frequently for CNN Opinion.

His brash style won over hearts and minds of Republican primary voters.\n\nFundamentally, the Republican Party has been changed.  The Republican National Committee is collateral damage and it will be President Trump's to rebuild.  Another question now is -- can Speaker Paul Ryan survive?\n\nAlice Stewart is a CNN Political Commentator, former Communications Director for Ted Cruz for President, and Republican Strategist.\n\nRoxanne Jones: 'Twitter is the true Voice of America'\n\nThe biggest take away from President-elect Donald J. Trump's shocking win: Twitter is the true Voice of America. And that voice is raw, rough, raging against Washington and very, very white. Every high-priced pollster who forecast Hillary Clinton would win easily should return their paychecks. America is deeply divided and Twitter predicted it first -- for free. \n\nTrump led the charge of the angry, working-class white man -- and quite a few white women --  and his troops followed in force, giving him a historic victory. The former TV reality star stormed across the nation drawing in millions of new voters, pushing his us-against-them rhetoric, denigrating women, immigrants, Mexicans, Muslims and \"the blacks.\" Didn't matter. It was a message millions of people were waiting to hear. \n\nIt has always been difficult to dissect the source of the hatred and mistrust aimed at Hillary Clinton. Is it sexism, racism, her hawkish foreign policies, or her too-liberal social policies? Is Clinton's loss really about emails? Or, could it simply be that America is just not ready to put a woman in the White House? Many believe Clinton was a victim of white backlash against America's first black president. No telling. But now, undoubtedly, there will be a rush to try to tarnish President Obama's legacy, even though he has enjoyed the highest approval ratings of any recent outgoing president. \n\nOne thing is undeniable: Clinton never passionately connected with voters. Not with women, Latinos, Millennials, or blacks, many of whom never trusted her after she supported President Bill Clinton's harsh drug laws that led to the mass incarceration of millions of blacks and Latinos. As one #BlackLivesMatter activist in Philadelphia, Asa Khalif, told me: \"I voted for Clinton, but I was extremely saddened that Black America only had two choices, her and a racist bigot. Very dark days ahead for all of us.\" \n\nSo here we stand, an angry, divided, fearful Republic. And it will up to Trump get us back together again of he is to truly win America's heart and soul.\n\nRoxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as a producer and as a reporter at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer.

People who have been ignored, walked upon, told that their concerns don't matter. They believe in America, but America hasn't believed in them. When Donald Trump came on the scene, for the first time, they had a voice.  \n\nDid it help that his opponent is one of the worst candidates in American history? Of course, but don't discount his message. It was his message that won, his message that broke through, his message that brought thousands of Americans who have never supported a Republican into his camp.\n\nNow the work begins. Republicans must hold him accountable. They must ensure that the promises he made are kept. \n\nBut that's for tomorrow. For today, the voiceless have spoken, and they were heard from one side of the country to the other, and in every corner of the globe.  \n\nBrett J.

While the temptation will be for analysts to linger on the improbability of tonight's outcome, the reality is that a presidential transition and new Congress await.  \n\nA top priority for President-elect Trump should be the repeal of Obamacare and its replacement with market-oriented, cost-lowering reforms. The health law was a central issue in the stretch run of the campaign and Republicans finally have an opportunity to accomplish what they've been unable to for the last six years.  \n\nThere are, of course, other important priorities -- the naming of a constitutional conservative to take the late Justice Antonin Scalia's place on the Supreme Court and growth-boosting tax and regulatory reform for starters. But few things would do more to signal to all Americans (and to reassure some jittery Republicans) that President-elect Trump is serious about reform than taking immediate action on Obamacare.\n\nLanhee J.

He meant no schadenfreude. He was actually just afraid. While I was confused. I only understood his meaning when, on another trip to Pakistan, another middle-aged man just like him said, \"America is so powerful, no enemy can destroy it. Only America can ruin America.\" \n\nHad Clinton won, she would have had simply the White House and maybe, just maybe, the Senate. She would have faced impossible gridlock. I was never very reassured when people told me \"the system\" would restrain Donald Trump if he won. Trump is a force of nature. He destroys all in his path. He bent the GOP to his will (to power). And now Trump handed the party that so inconsistently but clearly opposed him the keys to power.\n\nThey know, and he knows, that they will have to go out of their way to prove their loyalty to him.\n\nI would hope Trump governs responsibly, maturely and reasonably. But I am under no illusions. Some thirteen years ago, we went abroad in search of monsters to destroy. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. But we are not helpless to respond, nor even helpless. A majority of Americans voted for Hillary Clinton, but the system the Founding Fathers established to keep a strongman out of office has instead given him that office.\n\nThe task before us is to first survive this onslaught.\n\nAnd then to turn it back, all of us together, black, white, brown, Christian and atheist, Muslim and Jewish, richer and poorer, liberal and conservative. It will not be easy. It will not be pretty. It will not be for the fainthearted. We must make America great again.  \n\nHaroon Moghul is a Senior Fellow and Director of Development at the Center for Global Policy. His next book, How to Be a Muslim, will be out in 2017.\n\nJeff Yang: Nothing prepared us for this \n\nNothing prepared us for this outcome -- a victory by Trump that seems to have been the antithesis of what every poll and pundit predicted, save for a handful of outliers who were dismissed as partisan fantasists. (Bill Mitchell was right after all.)\n\nAs recently as hours before early returns began to deal shuddering blows to overconfident Democrats, insiders were still predicting blowout electoral victory for Clinton. \n\nYet at the returns-watching event I organized tonight, we could only watch with our mouths open as states no one had credibly predicted for Trump turned red. \n\nTalking heads instantly began yammering about white economic anxiety, about the feeling in the Midwest that the recovery had left them behind. But even states like Iowa that have had solid fiscal bouncebacks under Obama -- and voted for him twice --  went for Trump. \n\nAnd in these states, the issues that voters said were most important in making their presidential selection were immigration and terrorism. \n\nThe fact that polls failed to pick up the breadth of Trump's support is even more evidence of an uncomfortable truth: White people in this country fear and resent the browning of America, and a demagogue whose central platform plank was a promise to turn back time to an era before a black president, before the boom of immigration, before civil rights, maybe even before Emancipation, appealed to them in ways they refused to publicly admit.\n\nAnd now America faces four years under Trump, with a Republican House and Senate, and at least one, possibly three Supreme Court vacancies to fill. Trump owns the GOP, and can take it whatever direction he chooses. Emboldened racists will target people of color; sexual abusers have been given tacit permission to predate at will. Obamacare is threatened, perhaps fatally. So are marriage equality and Roe v. Wade. \n\nBut it is no longer time to mourn, but to organize. The groups that will suffer most under Trump have always had to be stronger than the storm, and though they have been bound, they will not be broken.\n\nJeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal and a frequent contributor to radio shows including Public Radio International's \"The Takeaway\" and WNYC's \"The Brian Lehrer Show.\" He is the co-author of \"I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action\" and editor of the graphic novel anthologies \"Secret Identities\" and \"Shattered.\" \n\nBuck Sexton: An astonishing turn of events\n\nDonald Trump's presidential win is utterly stunning. For weeks leading up to the actual casting of ballots, major media outlets were saying the election was over and Hillary Clinton would coast into the Oval Office. Most polls said that Clinton had a comfortable lead. Revered journalists felt free to treat Trump with utter disdain, and popular culture constantly vilified the Republican candidate as a hateful bigot, misogynist, and racist.\n\nThen, on election night, Trump went out and crushed Hillary Clinton.\n\nThis is an astonishing turn of events. A candidate who was ridiculed for months as nothing more than a reality TV star with a Twitter account defeated the undisputed dynastic heir of the Democratic Party. Mrs. Clinton was flush with more cash than any previous presidential aspirant, and a mainstream media that was willing to act as virtual campaign surrogates for her. Yet Trump the reviled outsider pushed aside the ultimate insider. He won, convincingly, despite all the disbelief and promises that it could never happen.\n\nFor Democrats, it's all deeply disconcerting. There will be plenty of explanations and recriminations, most of which will rely upon taking a dimmer view of the American electorate. It is very unlikely the Democratic Party elites will recognize that their snide attitudes towards everyday Americans, along with their maniacal devotion to multiculturalism, finally boiled over in the minds of a majority of Americans. Progressives will take all the wrong lessons from this, and thus the stakes in the culture war will only get higher.\n\nFor Republicans, on the other hand, this is an across-the-board triumph that creates tremendous momentum for 2017. With a GOP-controlled House and Senate, the Republican Party has a clear mandate, and mission, courtesy of Donald Trump, the man at the top of the ticket: to make America great again.\n\nFor the sake of all Americans, I hope they are successful. \n\nBuck Sexton is a political commentator for CNN and host of \"The Buck Sexton Show\" on TheBlaze.

Very few people saw this coming -- his candidacy, his campaign, and his victory. \n\nThe Republican Party had changed in pretty dramatic ways over the past decade and many of the experts missed it. Indeed, many Republicans missed it as well. The tea party had been the first indication that the Republican Party had moved in a more rightward, rambunctious, smash-mouth and reactionary direction. Donald Trump understood this, and he crafted a campaign around this new GOP. The question now is, what happens when he moves into the challenge of governance?\n\nJulian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \"Jimmy Carter\" and \"The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\"\n\nNayyera Haq: 'Mr. Trump, please rise above the rhetoric you stoked'\n\nIn his acceptance speech, President-elect Trump pledged to be \"President for all Americans\" and asked for people like me, who did not support his campaign, for our \"guidance and help so we can work together and unify our great country.\" \n\nAs the daughter of hard-working immigrants, the wife of a black man, and the soon-to-be-mother of a mixed-race child, I accept the next President's request at face value and respond with this: Mr. Trump, please rise above the rhetoric you stoked in the campaign and recognize the worries of minorities in the United States. \n\nThough enough people Googled \"immigration to Canada\" to crash the website last night, I have no plans to move out of the country.

I will raise my soon-to-arrive newborn as a proud American who believes in the ideals that we are all created equal and endowed with the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. \n\nBased on campaign rhetoric, I would have to pursue my unalienable rights from an internment camp (at worst) or while being banned from plane travel (at best); with my husband being stopped-and-frisked while I worry about him being shot by police; or with my private parts up for grabs while I struggle to break gender barriers at work. For my family, this is what was at stake with the Presidential election -- not a set of esoteric policies, but a cultural and social direction that would determine our daily life routines and very sense of being. \n\nI have no doubt a similar anxiety of an upended life, with different details, motivated many Trump voters. My Trump-voting friends from my hometown of Staten Island admitted that \"Crooked Hillary\" felt like more of a threat to them than the theoretical deportation of their friends. While the disconnect between our perceptions of harm still astounds me, there is clearly more for me to understand about the desires and fears of people who support a Trump presidency. As part of the call for unity, I pledge to also rise above anger and reactionary rhetoric to help fix the root of the problem -- finding ways to step out of the segregated bubbles of experience that have led to the disconnect and lack of empathy among fellow Americans in the first place.\n\nNayyera Haq is a former White House Senior Director and State Department spokesperson in the Obama administration, Nayyera is a regular commentator on politics and current affairs.\n\n \n\nFrida Ghitis: Will we recognize America? \n\nThe most dispiriting, bizarre election in modern American history concluded with a shocking outcome. The slow-motion realization that Donald Trump is becoming the next President of the United States left much of the country dumbfounded, American allies deeply worried, and America's enemies no doubt in a celebratory mood. At the Kremlin, they may well have had champagne with their Wednesday morning breakfast.\n\nThe big question now is what kind of a president Donald Trump will be. As a candidate, he inspired millions to support him, even if large majorities of Americans said they believe he has the wrong temperament to be president. His candidacy also inspired a surge in ugly expressions of hatred, as racists, anti-Semites, xenophobes and homophobes felt emboldened to flex their muscles.\n\nIf that's what a Trump candidacy wrought, what will a Trump presidency bring? Will we recognize this country four years from now?\n\nTrump won't just be president. He will lead a party that will control all the branches of government, making it possible for him to move forward with his plans with little effective resistance.\n\nFor the sake of the country and the world, let us hope that his more outrageous statements were only an act, only political theater. If what we saw was real, which is more likely, let's hope for a miracle, for a conversion on the road to Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nWe can only hope that the magnitude of what has occurred will produce a change in the man, removing his most dangerous tendencies, disappointing his cheerleaders in Moscow, Damascus, and other capitals where regimes view America as the enemy and a thriving United States as a danger to be thwarted.\n\nLet's hope Trump finds a way to embrace the best of America, which, during the campaign he seemed to so easily disdain; values such as tolerance of different ideas, backgrounds and beliefs; respect for America's freedom of the press and independence of the judiciary. \n\nThe odds of a miraculous transformation seem minuscule. The country, Americans, will have to be on their guard. If this election was a test of American democracy, the Trump presidency will be an even tougher one.\n\n \n\nFrida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis.\n\nRuth Ben-Ghiat: \n\nEvery American presidential election is a referendum on the state of the nation. This one has also been a showdown between candidates so different that the nation in question seemed to be two separate entities. One looks back to a \"better time\" for a white majority constituency now threatened by demographic change and immigration. \"I alone can fix it,\" says Donald Trump, this nation's savior. The other is oriented to the future and sees increased diversity as a source of strength rather than fear.\n\nToday this former nation sent a message to the political establishment -- and the nation's nonwhite populations -- by electing Donald Trump. Instead of 30 years of leadership, we have a political neophyte who saw a gap in the political marketplace and sold himself as a racist who would avenge eight years of an African-American in the Oval Office. Instead of a former secretary of state, we have a man who knows little about foreign relations. Instead of a commander in chief, we have a man who insults our troops past and present, and a man so impulsive his campaign had to take his phone away from him to stop his destructive tweeting, as though he were a child. \n\nI feel great sadness and trepidation for America tonight. We are better than this. Our task as citizens will be to let Donald Trump know it, in the strongest possible terms. \n\nRuth Ben-Ghiat is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University. Her latest book is \"Italian Fascism's Empire Cinema.\" \n\nTim Naftali: Trump a blank slate on foreign policy, security\n\nThe American people have spoken. In Electoral College terms, this wasn't a cliffhanger. Hillary Clinton's slender margin in Virginia was the first sound from that canary in the mineshaft, which tweeted louder and louder as results from Pennsylvania and the Upper Midwest came in. Just as many Americans cautioned Trump supporters to be prepared to accept the result when the mythical \"blue wall\" seemed real, now the half of America that did not vote for him must do so, for the sake of our venerable system of government. It is a constitutional compact, in return for which Donald J. Trump will have to respect his part of the bargain when he takes the oath of office. \n\nThe results of this election are more stunning than those of 1980, the last time an insurgency took the White House. President-elect Trump will enter office with both the House and Senate controlled by Republicans. Ronald Reagan faced a Democratic majority in the House. Trump's relationship with rank and file Republicans will be interesting to watch because of the ideological differences (he is more protectionist and less socially conservative), but they will start their terms on the same team. \n\nAnd yet, there wasn't the same tidal wave of support for the insurgent this time. Though Reagan did not control all of Congress, he did win the popular vote in 1980, by nearly 10%. It seems likely Trump will have lost the popular vote. Reagan's themes also challenged the political norms of the day; but so unlike Trump, Reagan had actually governed and knew what it was to compromise for the welfare of people other than his own family. And, finally, though Reagan had no actual foreign policy experience; he had thought about foreign policy; he had read about it and he was prepared to learn from others about it. The President-elect is a blank slate on foreign and security policy, except for some very troubling bluster, biases and \"bromances.\"\n\nFor months, analysts of the Trump phenomenon built what was thought to be a reality-based case for why he would lose. For months, it was widely assumed that it was not possible to win in 2016 with themes better suited to 1968. And yet it is the Trump campaign that can now rightly claim to have figured out the reality of a powerful part of America in 2016. He did not win over all of America, but enough to add the White House to his residences in 2017. I just looked outside; the sky hasn't fallen down, but there is no sunshine, either.   \n\nTim Naftali is a CNN presidential historian and clinical associate professor of history and public service at New York University and was the founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum.

In terms of criteria, note that projects were judged more harshly if their creative auspices invited somewhat higher expectations.\n\nCrisis in Six Scenes (Amazon): \n\nThe streaming service was clearly thrilled to be able to promote an original TV series from Woody Allen, but someone forgot to tell the director to share its enthusiasm. The result: A completely phoned in afterthought that felt like a particularly dreadful Allen movie stretched out over six episodes.\n\nThe X-Files (Fox): \n\n\"TV reboots\" almost earned its own category, but enough of them were pretty good to avoid that indignity. Still, after two movies, and 14 years since the series ended, Fox got the \"X-Files\" gang back together, and while a lot of fans wanted to believe again, the truth is they shouldn't have bothered. The stand-alone episodes were uninspired, but the mythology chapters were particularly bad, before closing on a ridiculous cliffhanger. \n\nDivorce (HBO): \n\nSarah Jessica Parker's much-ballyhooed return to HBO came in the form of a lifeless, jokey series that ill served its talented cast and looked especially pallid juxtaposed with its less-heralded companion, \"Insecure.\"\n\nCriminal Minds: Beyond Borders (CBS): \n\nEven for a spinoff of an existing procedural, this drama about Americans threatened by homicidal lunatics abroad was xenophobic and nasty. Given CBS' heavy reliance on crime shows, it also signaled that the network has so exhausted the domestic supply of serial killers that it felt compelled to import them.\n\n60 Days In (A&E): \n\nThere's no denying that A&E's undercover \"experiment\" -- putting several ordinary people inside a jail wired with hundreds of cameras -- was compelling and provocative. But it also lowered the bar in terms of at least creating the appearance of unnecessarily placing people in potential harm's way as a source of entertainment, and prominently featured one participant who came across either as a posturing reality-TV wannabe seeking 15 minutes of fame or wholly delusional.\n\nNotorious (ABC): \n\nDespite its real-life inspiration -- with famed lawyer Mark Geragos and former \"Larry King Live\" producer Wendy Walker among its creative team -- this attempt to do a sexy court-and-crime show by mixing a beautiful cable news producer and dashing defense attorney was ill-conceived on most every level. (The network also produced a close runner-up with the equally unnecessary \"Conviction.\")\n\nStar (Fox): \n\nGranted, critics have only seen the pilot and two upcoming episodes. But based strictly on that, it appears Fox and producer Lee Daniels tried to replicate the music-driven soapiness of \"Empire\" -- and came up with a latter-day \"Showgirls\" instead.\n\nHunting Hitler (History):\n\nAlthough the show technically premiered in late 2015, its second season began in November. There's nothing wrong with having an open mind and curiosity, but it's worth pointing out in a year when \"fake news\" received so much attention, History is willingly promoting bad history -- filled with unsubstantiated theories and speculation -- pitched specifically to conspiracy-theorist types eager to believe that Bigfoot exists and Hitler is working at a Walmart somewhere.\n\nCampaign surrogates:\n\nThe idea of presenting an assortment of voices to articulate candidates' views isn't a bad one. But unlike analysts and commentators who could be counted on to express their own opinions, these unapologetic partisans simply defended their man or woman regardless of the circumstances. Beyond often trafficking in misleading information that frequently did more to obscure than enlighten, at a certain point the arguments became just plain boring.\n\nJonBenet Ramsey revisited: \n\nIf you need a demonstration of TV's me-too impulse at its worst, look no further than the deluge of programming intended to reopen this 20-year-old child murder, yielding specials on CBS, NBC's \"Dateline,\" A&E, Investigation Discovery and CNN. There was also a new Lifetime movie, \"Who Killed JonBenet?,\" creepily \"narrated\" by the dead girl.\n\nWhy all the sudden interest? Because \"Making a Murderer\" and \"The Jinx\" were hits and media sensations -- prompting everyone in TV to join the true-crime trend. As a bonus, like the O.J. Simpson trial, the Ramsey case's 20th anniversary offered an excuse for various networks to pile on.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.4106411933898904, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 657, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.74867127833, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 13, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161223000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.9786910197869099, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.1818181818200002}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/09/politics/trump-cabinet-confirmation-hearings/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1028, "scraper_regex": 1162}}, "headline": "Cabinet hearings kick off: Meet Trump's new government", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1162, "date": "20170109120000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump's nominees for top Cabinet posts are in the spotlight this week as the Senate holds a frenzy of confirmation hearings. \n\nDemocrats are likely to focus on Trump's cozy ties with Russia -- as well as his unexplored foreign policy positions -- in hearings for posts including defense secretary and homeland security secretary. \n\nDemocrats plan to put Trump on trial through his nominees\n\nLawmakers have also pressed Republicans to delay hearings or confirmation votes, saying they have not been properly vetted. As of Friday, the Office of Government Ethics told Democratic senators it had not received drafts of ethics forms from several nominee who have hearings this week. Hearings for the CIA director and education secretary have been delayed. \n\nFollow CNN's live coverage of the confirmation hearings and see below for the hearings to watch this week: \n\nJeff Sessions, attorney general \n\nHearing schedule: 9:30 a.m. Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nThe fireworks could begin at the first hearing for a Trump nominee. Sessions, the Alabama senator -- once a US attorney and state attorney general -- has long faced accusations of racism. He wasn't confirmed for a federal judgeship in 1986 after ex-colleagues testified he had made racist comments and joked that his problem with the Ku Klux Klan was its use of marijuana. \n\nThe personal relationships Sessions has developed with senators since he was first elected in 1996 -- and the close relationship between Sessions, who was among Trump's earliest and strongest supporters in the Senate, and the President-elect -- are Sessions' strongest assets. \n\nSessions faces senate grilling\n\nOld allegations of racism could play role at Sessions hearing\n\nJohn Kelly, secretary of Homeland Security\n\nHearing schedule: 3:30 p.m. Tuesday before the Senate Homeland Security Committee\n\nKelly was previously the head of US Southern Command, putting much of the US' immediate vicinity under his purview -- including the control of Guantanamo Bay. Trump has pledged the US will redouble its focus on its southern border and overhaul its approach to terror threats. \n\nWhat to expect at Kelly's confirmation hearing\n\nWho is John Kelly?\n\nRex Tillerson, secretary of state\n\nHearing schedule: 9 a.m. Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\n\nThe ExxonMobil CEO's work in foreign hot spots -- including Russia, Saudi Arabia and Yemen -- and his business acumen are among the reasons Trump selected him as America's top diplomat. \n\nBut Tillerson's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin -- including the reception of Russia's Order of Friendship -- and will also come under intense scrutiny, because Tillerson has yet to weigh in on a host of foreign policy matters, including US sanctions on Russia in the wake of its incursion in Crimea. \n\nTillerson is also likely to face the brunt of questions about Trump's own public cheerleading for Putin and Russia. \n\nWho is Rex Tillerson?\n\nMike Pompeo, CIA\n\nHearing schedule: 10 a.m. Wednesday Thursday before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (delayed by one day after originally being scheduled for Wednesday)\n\nTillerson won't be the only nominee whose hearing will be dominated by Russia. Kansas GOP Rep. Mike Pompeo, Trump's pick to lead the CIA, will also face questions about Trump's relationship with the intelligence community in the wake of his public criticism of its conclusions on Russia's hacking of the US election. \n\nExpect Democrats to open fronts on torture, transparency, surveillance and unfiltered, fact-based assessments. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon is the most liberal member of that committee, and he will likely hit the surveillance issue, and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein has been very vocal on the torture report.\n\nTrump downplays Russian meddling in US election\n\nBetsy DeVos, education secretary\n\nHearing schedule: 10 a.m. Wednesday (delayed until the week of 1/16) before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee\n\nThe billionaire education reformer will be a litmus test on the school reforms -- particularly vouchers and charter schools -- championed for years by conservatives, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. \n\nBut she has no experience working in education. DeVos, Democrats are certain to point out, has never worked as a teacher or school administrator, and sent her children to private school. That disconnect is unusual for a post leading the nation's education department, which doles out dollars to the public schools that DeVos acknowledges her positions threaten. \n\nTrump vs. Trump's cabinet\n\nElaine Chao, transportation secretary \n\nHearing schedule: 10:15 a.m. Wednesday before the Senate Commerce Committee\n\nChao has been in this position before, when she was nominated as President George W. Bush's secretary of Labor. She also has a history at the Department of Transportation, as deputy secretary during the George H.W. Bush administration.\n\nChao would play a key role in for the administration in getting an infrastructure measure through Congress and directing spending through DOT. \n\nHer husband is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nDonald Trump keeps DC swampy\n\nJames Mattis, defense secretary\n\nHearing schedule: 9:30 a.m. Thursday before the Senate Armed Services Committee\n\nThe retired general nicknamed \"Mad Dog\" and known for once quipping that it's \"fun to shoot some people\" is known for leading the Battle of Fallujah in Iraq and is widely respected on Capitol Hill. \n\nHis hearing, though, is another likely to turn into another referendum on Trump's approach to Russia -- as well as the President-elect's untested plans to combat ISIS in Syria and Iraq. \n\nMattis has already clashed with his new bosses over the over the transition selecting a secretary of the Army without his input, several sources told CNN, including threatening  to quit if the transition team tried to appoint more people without him. \n\nWho is retired Gen. James Mattis?\n\nBen Carson, housing and urban development secretary\n\nHearing schedule: 10 a.m. Thursday before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee\n\nCarson -- like Trump -- was part of the 2016 Republican presidential primary's political newcomer class. His story of a hardscrabble upbringing in Detroit, overcoming his own violent tendencies before becoming a leading brain surgeon at Johns Hopkins, and his religious faith shot him to conservative stardom. \n\nBut Carson also has no experience in public housing or urban policy. His most direct step into housing policy came in an op-ed in which he criticized the Obama administration's efforts to shift public housing out of lower-class, minority-dominated neighborhoods.  \n\nWilbur Ross, commerce secretary\n\nHearing schedule: 10 a.m. Thursday before the Senate Commerce Committee\n\nRoss, a New York billionaire businessman, is likely to face tough questioning from Democrats eager to portray his  record as at odds with Trump's populist appeal to working Americans during the campaign. Should he be confirmed, Ross is expected to have an outsized impact on US trade policy compared to past Commerce secretaries as he would be put in charge of overseeing US trade policy and renegotiating existing trade deals, in line with Trump's campaign pledges.\n\nAlthough Ross has advocated for the Trans Pacific Partnership, a potential deal Trump has railed against, he has also signaled opposition to free trade deals in the past. In a CNN interview after Trump's selection, Ross said his first goal would be to renegotiate NAFTA.\n\nWho is Wilbur Ross?", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.6695958375930802, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1028, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.9569919940499996, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170109120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.4319066147859902, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/opinions/global-gag-rule-backlash-garrett/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Gag me: Trump's anti-abortion executive order ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 861, "date": "20170124020000", "story_content": "Here we go again. The bad old days of United States foreign assistance are coming back, now that President Donald Trump signed an executive order reinstating the global gag rule on overseas discussion of abortion by individuals and organizations receiving federal funding. We have been here twice before -- under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush -- and we know that this order often backfires, leading to increased abortion rates.\n\nSince 1973, under the Helms Amendment, it has been illegal to use US government money to directly fund abortions overseas. The global gag rule, introduced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984 as part of his Mexico City Policy, made discussion of abortion by a group receiving federal support for any purpose illegal. \n\n\"The United States does not consider abortion an acceptable element of family planning programs and will no longer contribute to those of which it is a part,\" read the rule. \"The United States will no longer contribute to separate nongovernmental organizations which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.\"\n\nImplementation of the global gag rule went well beyond abortion to effectively limit all discussions of family planning, including condom use to prevent HIV infection and multiyear spacing of pregnancies to avoid maternal deaths. Organizations as diverse as the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund and Family Health International lost millions of dollars in support from the US government during the years the gag rule was enforced.\n\nIn 1993, President Bill Clinton rescinded the global gag rule. However, in 2001, President George W. Bush not only reinstated it, but appointed Bill Steiger, head of the Office of Global Health Affairs in the Department of Health and Human Services, to act as its enforcer. Even as the historic President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, unfolded, Steiger's team made sure AIDS groups promoting condom and birth control strategies lost government funding. In the original 2003 language of PEPFAR, the Bush administration added still more teeth to the global gag rule, prohibiting funding of any group that \"promotes or advocates\" legalization and practice of prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nWomen's health and HIV/AIDS organizations felt, justifiably, that the global gag rule made it impossible to engage in family planning and HIV prevention efforts, and many American groups that accepted US government funds after acceding to the rules were denied access to international meetings, shunned by counterpart non-American groups. \n\nIn 2006, the Congressional General Accountability Office concluded that the global gag rule, coupled with abstinence promotion, was impeding the global fight against HIV. A series of legal challenges arguing the rule violated the First Amendment right to free speech made their way through federal courts.\n\nThree days after his inauguration in 2009, President Barack Obama rescinded the global gag rule. And in 2011, researchers from Stanford University published striking evidence that the global gag rule had, perversely, increased abortion rates. In a survey of 20 poor countries receiving foreign assistance from the United States during the 1994 to 2008 time frame, the researchers, \"found robust empirical patterns suggesting that the Mexico City Policy is associated with increases in abortion rates in sub-Saharan African countries.\"\n\nWhere the Mexico City Policy was \"high exposure\" and enforced by US agencies, and adopted by the local government and NGOs, birth control use was low, particularly compared to use rates in countries that hadn't been saturated with anti-abortion, pro-abstinence messaging.\n\nAnd in those same \"high exposure\" countries saturated with abstinence messaging, and gagged under the Mexico City Policy, abortion rates soared.\n\nNow President Trump wants to turn back the clock to the 1980s, when televangelist Billy Graham declared, \"AIDS is a judgment of God.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters in a press conference on Monday that, \"It's no secret,\" that Trump \"is a pro-life president.\" Trump \"wants to stand up for all Americans, including the unborn,\" Spicer continued.\n\nBut this isn't 1984, and Donald Trump is no Ronald Reagan. In the United States, abortion rates last year were the lowest seen since the CDC started tracking the numbers. The procedure is less frequently used today because women and teenagers have access to birth control, sex education and the right to make choices about reproduction. \n\nContraceptive technology has improved since the 1980s, more women are in the labor force trying to balance work and family care duties and the global health community has become accustomed to incorporating family planning into general health and medical programs.\n\nThe world begrudgingly worked around the gag rule in the 1980s, fought it and the abstinence prevention strategy during the George W. Bush years and will likely do battle with reinstated gags in 2017. Limiting family sizes to slow population expansion and prevent maternal mortality is a matter of policy throughout the United Nations and most of the 194 nations today.\n\nAll the failures, bureaucratic nightmares and -- yes -- increases in abortion rates will now follow the gag rule reinstatement.

The administration emphasizes it's preventing only a \"small percentage\" of global travelers from entering or leaving the country, but our hospitals rely on a steady influx of international physicians to keep running. \n\nThroughout my medical career I've benefited from working alongside medical graduates from around the world. I've enjoyed professional relationships with Russians, Saudis, Canadians, Israelis, Iranians and Italians in the halls of medical centers in Alabama, Ohio, Missouri, Massachusetts and Georgia. Thanks to our conversations between cases I've learned about different medical systems and different approaches to managing the same conditions, and I've enjoyed their camaraderie. \n\nToday I work at one of the top rehabilitation hospitals in the country, and on our wards I've recently had the pleasure of overseeing a resident physician from Iran who's doing her rehabilitation specialty training through Emory University School of Medicine. She holds an H-1B visa, the kind our government grants to the highly skilled workers our economy needs.\n\nUnder President Trump's new order, even after the interventions of two federal courts, if she left the country for any reason, such as going to visit family, she might be locked out from returning. Her colleagues, including myself, trust her to care for patients at the country's eighth ranked rehabilitation hospital, but our government doesn't trust her enough to let her travel.  \n\nOther doctors made the mistake of being out of the country the same week Donald Trump started flexing his newfound powers. Border agents ejected a Cleveland Clinic physician who arrived at John F. Kennedy Airport on Saturday, directing her back to Saudi Arabia (she holds a Sudanese passport). On Sunday the clinic took a bold stand against the White House's disruptive new policy, saying it had caused uncertainty for its employees and that the clinic is \"fully committed and actively working toward the safe return of any of our employees who have been affected by this action.\"  \n\nAnyone who doesn't work in health care may be surprised to learn just how much American medicine, ranging from the Cleveland Clinic to your own local hospital, relies on physicians from abroad. International medical graduates represent an essential influx of talent that supplements our own domestic medical school trainees, who are in too short supply to treat everyone who needs care in our communities. \n\nOur training hospitals posted job listings for 27,860 new medical graduates last year alone, but American medical schools only put out 18,668 graduates. International physicians percolate throughout the entire medical system. To highlight just one particularly intense specialty, fully 30% of American transplant surgeons started their careers in foreign medical schools. Even with our current influx of international physicians as well as steadily growing domestic medical school spots, the Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that we'll be short by up to 94,700 doctors by 2025. \n\nThe President's decision is as ill-timed as it was sudden. The initial 90-day order encompasses Match Day, the already anxiety-inducing third Friday in March when medical school graduates officially commit to their clinical training programs. Unless the administration or the courts quickly fix the mess President Trump just created, many American hospitals could face staffing crises come July when new residents are slated to start working. \n\nThe international doctors who come to our shores represent some of the best ambassadors for their native countries, but they all have their own reasons for choosing to build medical careers in America. In doing so many are looking to leave behind more authoritarian regimes. \n\nWhen it comes to the impact on our health care system, some countries may appreciate President Trump's new medical blockade. As the Iranian-born resident working with me pointed out, her home government will be happy to see its educated citizens and scientists stay right where they are. \"If [Trump] wants to fight with the Iranian government in this way, it doesn't work at all.\"\n\nIt doesn't seem to matter what element of American medicine this President touches; on issues ranging from vaccines to health insurance to simply keeping our hospitals staffed, Trump has a way of downgrading his patient to life support. \n\nWe have a phrase for this kind of unfortunate person in medicine, and it doesn't matter whether you graduated from med school in Iran or Alabama, you know it: a black cloud. If your black cloud persists, you might need to think about an alternate career. With his cloud's darkness spreading fast, it's past time Trump step away from the health care policy arena.

Doing so only indiscriminately elevates public anxiety. It also creates the toxic conditions within our body politic that lead to costly and harmful overreactions, which end up rewarding our adversaries for engaging in acts of terror.\n\nGenerating widespread fear about a real, but limited danger serves no useful end.  Remember the color-coded warning system that was trotted out after 9/11? It was widely criticized, and for good reason. What were people supposed to do when the US Department of Homeland Security declared condition orange or condition red? The Obama administration quite rightly abandoned it.  \n\nPlaying up a sense of pervasive and indiscriminate threat that leaves Americans feeling helpless and has two dangerous outcomes. For the already anxious, it fuels paranoia. For the skeptics, it provides fodder for their apathy and denial.\n\nSecond, don't overstate what can be done about the threat. After 9/11, elected leaders and national security and homeland security officials would often say: \"Terrorists have to be right only once, while we have to be right 100% of the time.\" The intent was to convey commitment toward doing whatever it takes to prevent the next act of terrorism. But the outcome was to create overinflated public expectations about what can and was being done to make the homeland safe. In what human endeavor has government ever been 100% successful? When the inevitable happens, and the nation feels as though it has been misled, public trust ends up strewn among the casualties.\n\nPreventing terrorism is hard, particularly when dealing with homegrown lone-wolf attacks. This risk is being well-managed by law enforcement at all levels, supported by recent homeland security programs to combat violent extremism by providing resources to communities to put in place local prevention efforts. To President Barack Obama's credit, he has resisted the temptation to overpromise and has been willing to take the political heat for doing so. Over the past eight years, he has soberly declared that acts of terror cannot always be prevented, while reminding Americans that we are a strong and resilient people who no adversary can defeat.\n\nThird, don't alienate the people whose assistance is needed to deal with the threat. Law enforcement and security professionals are rarely successful on their own. The most effective policing is community policing supported by neighborhood watches. Policing that devolves into \"us vs. them\" ends up being dangerous for everyone involved.\n\nDealing with the risk of jihadist extremism requires close collaboration with American Muslim communities and the cooperation of intelligence and security services in majority-Muslim countries. Confronting the risk that terrorist groups may try to evade our border controls requires that homeland security officials have good relations with our Canadian and Mexican neighbors and with foreign officials at airports and seaports overseas. \n\nBeginning with the Bush administration and accelerated under the Obama administration, a number of cooperative programs have been put in place to provide strategic depth by pushing our borders outward. These include the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Container Security Initiative programs, in which US Customs agents work with their foreign counterparts to inspect US-bound cargo before its heads our way. These efforts depend on good global relations centered around shared goals and common interests.\n\nTrump wildly exaggerates the threat posed to the United States by terrorism.  He matches his hyperbole with sophistry, promising to build \"impenetrable\" border walls and to \"defeat the ideology of radical Islamic terrorism\" that \"I alone\" can deliver. By demonizing Muslims generally and immigrants specifically, Trump has been poisoning the well in ways that compromise decadelong counterterrorism efforts to engage with these communities.\n\nSmart security is always nuanced and, at times, counterintuitive, which is why it trips up capable bad guys. Alternatively, tough security is always simple, which makes it politically attractive, but always ineffective for the adversaries we really need to worry about. And security is never an end onto itself.  When the Founding Fathers outlined their intent \"to form a more perfect Union,\" the only place they used the word \"secure\" in the Constitution, is in the preamble: \"to secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\" \n\nThe measure of a security solution is not whether it sounds good but whether it works.  In the face of the terrorist threat, Trump is only serving up sugar pills that undermine the best homeland security efforts of two Republican and Democratic administrations while also eroding the very constitutional principles that presidents solemnly take an oath to protect and defend.  As such, he poses a clear and present danger to the safety of the very homeland, whose protection he has placed at the core of his presidential candidacy.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.64852619171143, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 819, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 7.84245702771, "HarmVirtue": 24, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 12, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 70, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161106210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 6.3636363636399995, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 6, "pct_mft_words": 8.54700854700855, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/us/immigration-court-inauguration-day/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 589, "scraper_regex": 708}}, "headline": "Day One in Trump's America: 'I need a second chance'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 708, "date": "20170123130000", "story_content": "A balding and bearded Jamaican man trains his eyes on the table in front of him, nervously shaking his leg.\n\nHe's miles from home in a lonely courtroom.

The backlog grew to more than half a million last year.\n\nFor years, the leader of the immigration judges union has warned that the overburdened system doesn't give them enough time or resources to sort out complex cases -- noting that the consequences of a wrong decision can be dire.\n\nIt's like handling death penalty cases, she says, in traffic court settings.\n\nSo far this fiscal year, more than 90% of the cases decided in the Stewart Immigration Court have ended with a deportation order.

Now, I just drive with the radio up really loud or do a relaxing talk show when I really want to feel great and like myself.\"\n\nHere is a look back at times when Fisher shed light on mental health and addiction -- and a need for awareness.\n\n'I am mentally ill. ... I am not ashamed of that'\n\nFisher has said she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 24.\n\nShe disclosed her long battle with bipolar disorder and addiction in a December 2000 interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer on \"PrimeTime.\" \n\nFisher said she used to take 30 Percodan daily to try to manage her manic state. In the years that followed her prescription drug abuse, doctors helped her improve her health and maintain a recommended medication regimen.\n\n\"I have a chemical imbalance that, in its most extreme state, will lead me to a mental hospital,\" Fisher said in the ABC interview. \"I am mentally ill. I can say that. I am not ashamed of that. I survived that, I'm still surviving it, but bring it on. Better me than you.\"\n\nIn 2001, the National Alliance on Mental Illness honored Fisher with its Rona and Ken Purdy Award for her contribution in helping end mental health discrimination and stigma.\n\n'A tremendous amount of balls'\n\nFisher opened up about her life and struggles in the 2006 one-woman biographical play \"Wishful Drinking,\" which was turned into a memoir in 2009 and then a documentary in 2010. In another book, \"Postcards from the Edge,\" which was turned into a film, Fisher wrote about drug addiction.\n\nIn \"Wishful Drinking,\" Fisher wrote, \"One of the things that baffles me (and there are quite a few) is how there can be so much lingering stigma with regards to mental illness, specifically bipolar disorder. In my opinion, living with manic depression takes a tremendous amount of balls. Not unlike a tour of Afghanistan (though the bombs and bullets, in this case, come from the inside). At times, being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you're living with this illness and functioning at all, it's something to be proud of, not ashamed of. They should issue medals along with the steady stream of medication.\"\n\n'Princess Leia is bipolar, too'\n\nWhen Harvard College's Humanist Hub honored Fisher with an Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism in April, she shed light on her addictions and mental illness in her acceptance speech.\n\n\"I've never been ashamed of my mental illness; it never occurred to me,\" Fisher said, according to the Harvard Gazette. \"Many people thank me for talking about it, and mothers can tell their kids when they are upset with the diagnosis that Princess Leia is bipolar, too.\"\n\n'They really did heal me' \n\nFisher spoke often about the importance of treatment for mental health disorders.

John Lewis, a civil rights icon, and dozens of House Democrats saying they'll boycott Trump's swearing-in over it -- reaches its end. \n\nTrump's brash statements about ISIS, his cozy relationship with Russia and his criticism of NATO have the world bracing for a new type of American president. \n\nBut before all that, Republicans and Trump's still-growing staff are set for a celebration. Trump and Vice-President elect Mike Pence go through the ceremony at the Capitol at noon, followed by a parade up Pennsylvania Avenue -- and past Trump's new hotel -- to be followed by a weekend of balls and an anticipated flurry of new executive actions Monday. \n\nSpeaking at a pre-inauguration concert Thursday night at the Lincoln Memorial, which featured performances by Lee Greenwood, Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down, Trump told the crowd he vowed to be a president \"for all our people.\"\n\n\"It's a movement like we've never seen anywhere in the world, they say. There's never been a movement like this. And it's something very, very special,\" Trump said. \"And we're going to unify our country. And our phrase, you all know it -- half of you are wearing the hat, 'Make America great again.' But we're going to make America great for all our people, everybody. Everybody throughout our country. That includes the inner cities. That includes everybody.\"\n\nLater, speaking at a dinner held at Washington's Union Station, Trump thanked Pence, his top advisers and his family as he reflected on his election victory.\n\n\"That was some big victory. That was some victory,\" said Trump, who also mused that \"next time, we're going to win the old fashioned way,\" an apparent reference to victory in the popular vote as well as the Electoral College.\n\nProtesters, police scuffle\n\nProtesters and Washington police scuffled Thursday night outside a meeting of pro-Trump conservatives, the first of several demonstrations aimed at disrupting the new administration's inaugural weekend.\n\nProtesters gathered on 14th Street outside the National Press Club to demonstrate against \"DeploraBall,\" an event organized by some of Trump's most fervent supporters. The name riffs off the campaign description of some Trump backers by his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, as a \"basket of deplorables.\" \n\nAs attendees -- some of whom were clad in suits and red hats, others dressed in gowns -- entered the event, demonstrators chanted \"Shame\" and \"Nazis go home\" behind a phalanx of police. Some held signs that read \"No Alt Reich\" and \"No Nazi USA.\" \n\nOther protesters chanted against the \"alt-right,\" \"fascists\" and \"Nazi scum,\" though it could not be immediately determined who was attending the event.\n\nSome protesters could be seen setting small fires in the streets, though it was unclear what was set ablaze. A motorcycle was damaged on the street, and police could be seen pepper-spraying some protesters.\n\nWashington waits\n\nMeanwhile, the transition of power -- from a Democratic president to a Republican one -- has shut down much of Washington and left its thousands of political staffers in quiet anticipation. \n\nAt the same time, President Barack Obama's last boxes are being packed and his few remaining aides are preparing to move out as they enter their last moments hours of Obama's eight years in the White House. \n\nObama is spending the last full day of his presidency in the White House on Thursday, where staffers are saying their wistful goodbyes. \n\n\"After six years here, walking through these doors for the final time,\" White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz tweeted.\n\nAfter six years here, walking through these doors for the final time. pic.twitter.com/LUB0DnM4RU\u2014 Eric Schultz (@EricSchultz) January 19, 2017\n\nOutgoing White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest tweeted his thanks to the press corps. \"It's been an honor to serve.

But attendees can bring small, collapsible umbrellas.\n\nConfirmation battles\n\nOn Capitol Hill, members of the Senate are gearing up for an immediate battle over confirming Trump's Cabinet picks. \n\nAbout seven nominees may receive confirmation votes Friday afternoon, after Trump's inauguration, while Democrats are already looking to draw out the process with some of the picks, like secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson and HHS nominee Tom Price.\n\nObama held his final news conference Wednesday -- and his final interview was with a podcast run by a group of former aides, Tommy Vietor, Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett and Dan Pfeiffer.\n\nIn his final news conference, Obama offered an optimistic message as his party prepares to watch Republicans reverse many of its accomplishments from his tenure in office. \n\n\"It is true that behind closed doors, I curse more than I do publicly, and sometimes I get mad and frustrated like everybody else does,\" Obama said. \"But at my core, I think we're going to be OK. We just have to fight for it, we have to work for it and not take it for granted.\"\n\nAfter Trump's inauguration, Obama and his family will depart on one last presidential plane ride -- to a vacation in Palm Springs, California. They'll travel back on their own.

She had been told her case would get priority consideration because she is a single mother. She was interviewed at the embassy, underwent medical tests, and attended American culture classes arranged by the embassy.  She says she thought she would be permitted to travel any day. \n\nBut even for a single mother and two children, categories identified as the most vulnerable groups among refugees, 15 months of waiting didn't yield resettlement.  The process is rigorous, and according to news organizations like the BBC, often takes 18-24 months, should the family be selected. According to an October 2015 analysis from The New York Times, the United States had resettled just under 2,000 Syrian refugees since the war started.\n\nSham (a nickname she uses) says that meanwhile, life in Lebanon had become unbearable.  As a woman and a refugee, she was being exploited at every turn.\n\n\"In Syria you either live or you die, in Lebanon you feel like you are dying every day,\" Sham told me when I met her. \n\nI've heard this sentiment from many Syrians during the two years that I've been in Lebanon.  Residency laws result in day-to-day insecurity for the 1 million Syrians in the country, and single women are particularly vulnerable.\n\nIn September 2015, Sham decided she couldn't keep waiting for the chance to build a future for herself and her family, so she contacted smugglers and arranged to cross the Aegean Sea to Greece on an inflatable raft. The final straw for Sham was a doctor's warning that her 7-year-old, Lulu, would have permanent bone damage if she didn't get more protein, something Sham couldn't provide on her meager salary from teaching Arabic.\n\nHalfway across the 4-mile stretch, their overcrowded raft took on water and began to sink. Luly and her other child, Yaman, 10, emptied plastic bags and used them to bail water from the sinking raft.  Neither knew how to swim.\n\n\"We were afraid we would sink with the boat,\" Lulu told me. Their raft eventually drifted to shore and everyone survived, unlike the thousands of others who have died on similar routes, but Lulu still remembers the fear. \n\nAs an American, I found it heartbreaking to have a 7-year-old girl look me in the eye and tell me that she was certain she was going to drown in the middle of the sea because my country hadn't helped her. \n\nI followed Sham, Yaman and Lulu on the rest of their journey from Lesbos, Greece, to Berlin with my camera, and have spent the last year and a half documenting their story. I wanted to understand the circumstances that could lead a single mother to decide that risking her children's lives at sea was safer than staying on land. \n\nSham didn't want to take the raft. \"But when every other option is closed off, you choose to risk death,\" Sham told me from a refugee center in Berlin. \n\n Like American parents, Syrian parents desperately want what's best for their children.\n\nToday, according to UNICEF, there are more than 2 million Syrian children out of school (in both Syria and neighboring countries) and as many mothers and fathers who wake up in the morning wondering what they can do to provide their children a better future.\n\nWith President Trump's executive order, which indefinitely bans all Syrians, temporarily bans all refugees, and temporarily bans nationals from seven Muslim countries, there will be even fewer options for the single mothers, children, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups displaced by conflict to reach a safe space where they can build a life.\n\nAmerica has a moral obligation to do more to ensure that 7-year-olds are not bailing water out of their sinking rafts, or washing up dead on the beach because their parents are desperate to get them to a place where they can grow and thrive.\n\nToday the family of three is in Berlin. Yaman and Lulu missed an entire school year because there was no space in German schools.  Sham wasn't allowed to earn money for more than a year because her paperwork had not been processed in the backlog.  But I have no doubt that Sham will thrive one day when she has the tools to be self-sufficient. \n\nSeventeen months after she applied for resettlement, Sham received word from the American Embassy that there still was no decision on her application. America missed an opportunity to help Sham and her two clever, resilient children.  It shouldn't close the door to the thousands of others still waiting to be resettled.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.72082376480103, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 782, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.82842712475, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170129230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.81329923273657, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/health/obamacare-repeal-love-hate/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1270, "scraper_regex": 1393}}, "headline": "Obamacare: What should stay, and what should go?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1393, "date": "20161118200000", "story_content": "Calling it \"a fraud,\" \"horrible\" and \"a disaster,\" President-elect Donald Trump said that rolling back Obamacare and replacing it with a \"much less expensive\" alternative is top priority for his administration. \n\nBut Americans are divided on what should happen next. One-third of all voters recently polled want the law expanded, one-third want it repealed, and only 9% want the administration to scale back what it offers, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking Poll from October.\n\nThe law has always been polarizing. When the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act, as it is officially known, passed in 2010, it was considered the most dramatic overhaul of American health care in modern history.\n\nStudies show that it has made some people's lives better. It brought health coverage to 20 million more Americans, taking uninsured rates to an all-time low. It eliminated barriers to coverage and improved some hospitals, and fewer people with health emergencies went bankrupt.\n\nBut -- and this is a big \"but\" -- there's a reason former President Clinton called Obamacare \"the craziest thing in the world\" before he walked that statement back. It has gotten more expensive -- too expensive for some. Plan and doctor choices are now more limited. And there's still a large part of the population that can't get affordable care because their states chose not to expand Medicaid. \n\nEven President Obama said he'd be open to fixes if Republicans make it \"cheaper and better.\"\n\nTrump said his repeal-and-replace plan will be a major early priority. Republicans, who have tried to repeal it more than 60 times, could take it up again in January. But some experts suggest that it could take up to two years to change the health care process. And even with a Republican president, it is highly unlikely (PDF) that Republicans will succeed in a total repeal. \n\nWhat could it be? Trump said he wants something that works better \"where your plan can actually be tailored\" and wouldn't merely be a plan to use only if \"you get hit by a truck.\" He has an eye on cost, too; Trump has consistently said that Obamacare is \"far too expensive\" for the insured and for the country. \n\nBut Trump also told CBS' \"60 Minutes\" that he wants to keep some of the more popular parts of the law.\n\nConsidering what Trump has said about the plan in the past, what is possible in Congress and what the public seems to love and hate about the plan, here's a look at what part of Obamacare might make it into Trumpcare.\n\nWhat many people like about Obamacare\n\nCoverage for people with pre-existing conditions\n\nA popular part of Obamacare is the elimination of insurance companies' ability to use health status, medical history and gender to determine whether you are eligible for coverage. Nor can insurance companies use your health status to decide what benefits you get or what premiums you're charged. \n\nBefore the ACA, insurance companies could deny insurance to people if they had pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes or even pregnancy. These companies could also charge higher premiums and/or limit the benefits they'd offer to this population. \n\nOne in two Americans has a pre-existing condition, according to an analysis from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Of those people, 25 million -- 46% --  were uninsured prior to the ACA.\n\nThis part of the law became \"one of the strongest assets,\" Trump told \"60 Minutes,\" and he'd like to keep it.\n\n20-somethings on their parents' insurance\n\nAnother popular part of Obamacare: Young people can stay on their parents' insurance until they turn 26, even if they get married and even if they are not living with their parents. \n\nAs the recession made it difficult for young people to find jobs with benefits, this was a popular part of the law when it passed. Since 20- to 24-year-olds have nearly double the unemployment rate of their older non-millennial family members, it remains popular to this day.\n\nNearly 3 million previously uninsured young people got insurance under their parents' policies because of Obamacare.\n\nTrump told Lesley Stahl on \"60 Minutes\" that he will \"very much try and keep that.\" He added that it \"adds cost, but it's very much something we're going to try and keep.\" \n\nNo limits on annual or lifetime coverage\n\nThe ACA brought an end to lifetime limits on most plans. \n\nPrior to Obamacare, insurance companies could drop coverage when you were at your sickest. You could actually tap out your insurance resources, and the companies could set a dollar limit on what they'd spend on your care. \n\nAnyone who exceeded their limit was on the hook to pay for their care out of pocket. This part of the ACA was particularly popular with people who needed expensive drugs to fight rare diseases and those treated for cancers that required long hospital stays and lengthy chemotherapy. Many in those communities ended up facing medical bankruptcy, having to foot the bill for their own care. \n\nThe ACA ended limits on marketplace plans and on most insurance plans people got through their jobs. \n\nNo-cost preventive care\n\nObamacare allowed insured people to receive some health-care services at no cost. Basic services meant to keep you healthy like blood pressure checks, depression and HIV screenings, flu shots, breastfeeding supplies, mammograms and contraception, among other measures, were all covered.\n\nContraceptives were the only item in the list that remained controversial, at least for some institutions with religious affiliations.\n\nImmediately after the election, Tweets and Facebook posts warned women that a Trump presidency could limit birth control coverage. Trump hasn't specifically mentioned what he'd like to do with preventative care overall. In September, though, he said he doesn't think you should need a prescription to buy birth control.    \n\nImproved hospital quality \n\nIncentives in the ACA started to move health care from a fee-for-service model to one that rewards quality of care.\n\nThere's already evidence that Obamacare has improved care quality, studies show. There were real drops in hospital readmissions rates, and 50,000 fewer people died as a result of preventable errors and infections in hospitals from 2010 to 2013, according to White House data. \n\nBut there are plenty of parts of the law Trump and others despise that will probably have to change.\n\nWhat many people hate about Obamacare\n\nThe cost\n\nObamacare is too expensive for too many. In 2015, 46% of the uninsured adult population surveyed said they tried to get coverage but couldn't afford it, according to a recent Kaiser survey. \n\nThe vast majority who get Obamacare, some 85%, get subsidies to make premiums relatively affordable. Those who don't qualify for subsidies feel the pain of the rise in premiums the most. \n\nPremiums skyrocketed an average of 22% for the benchmark plan in 2017. The spikes are felt unevenly, depending on location. In states where insurers pulled out of the marketplace, the prices went up significantly. \n\nIn Oklahoma, for instance, the average premium price went up 69%. In Arizona, premiums more than doubled, and in Indiana, where there is more competition, the benchmark plan is 3% cheaper.\n\nThe cost of deductibles went up too, meaning even people who do have coverage often won't go see a doctor.\n\nTrump said one way he'll bring down costs is to allow people to buy insurance across state lines. He argues that that encourages competition. \n\n\"It'll be great health care for much less money,\" Trump told \"60 Minutes.\" \n\nRequired coverage and fewer choices\n\nSome don't like being told by their government that they have to have insurance. Over half of Republicans polled by Kaiser said they'd like to repeal the requirement that nearly all Americans have health insurance or pay a fine.\n\nPeople also complained about the kind of insurance available in marketplaces, especially as the number of insurers shrunk.\n\nTo keep costs down, marketplace insurers narrowed their provider networks, meaning people have fewer doctor and hospital options. \n\nConstant plan changes\n\nThe shrinking pool of insurers means people often have to investigate new plans when they re-enroll. Filling out additional paperwork and researching options have been a constant source of frustration.\n\nIn 2016, 43% of returning customers switched policies.  \n\nSmall business burdens\n\nSome business groups have complained about the requirement that workplaces with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees must offer health care or face fines. The US Chamber of Commerce said that deters business growth.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.8645533323287959, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1270, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.18899025194, "HarmVirtue": 17, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161118200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.83464566929134, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/28/world/eco-solutions-fog-catchers/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00f1": [40, 2868]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 553, "scraper_regex": 591}}, "headline": "Harvesting fog to solve a water crisis", "wordcount_as_scraped": 591, "date": "20161228180000", "story_content": "Pe\u00f1a Blanca is a small agricultural community 300 km north of Santiago. \n\nIn this arid coastal region, 'fog catchers' -- large nets strung up in areas with thick fog and high winds -- are used to collect water.\n\nThe technique was pioneered in Chile in the 1950s. The fog is pushed through fine mesh where it condenses, trickles down, and gets collected below. It's a cheap, effective, and clean way to source water. \n\nThe nets harvest precious water for crops and animals: 140 square meters provide 840 liters of water per day, shared among 85 landowners.\n\n\"Water shortage is a worldwide problem and we are not oblivious to it,\" says Daniel Rojas, community leader. \"It rains less and less, there is a lack of vegetation, fewer crops and people are affected in every sense. But here we have a natural resource that wasn't being exploited.\"\n\nThe 'camanchaca' is a thick coastal fog which rolls in most days. It blocks the sun, but the low visibility and wind is welcomed by the locals. \n\nThe Dar Si Hmad project in Morocco is significantly bigger, and uses next generation technology. The water collected here is clean enough to drink. And there are plans to use newer nets which are more efficient, doubling the amount of water they currently collect.\n\n\"They call me the fog queen,\" laughs Dr Jamila Bargach. \n\nShe has good reason to smile. As director of the world's largest fog catching project, she picked up an award at the 2016 UN climate conference in Marrakech for the work carried out by her women-led NGO.\n\n\"Our new nets have a mean average of 22 liters per square meter, which will service about 1,300 people, about 13 villages,\" she says. \n\nThe fog catchers have changed the lives of women in the Sahara, who previously scheduled their days around the chore of fetching and carrying water for their families.\n\n\"The average time is 3 hours per day to get your basic 30 liters. This is becoming even more difficult because you have to walk further with the consequences of climate change: desertification and the rising temperatures,\" says Dr Bargach. \n\n\"So where there's fog, we can harness it for the community, store it when it's needed, and then use it later, instead of looking for very expensive and fossil-based solutions like desalinizing water, or digging more bore holes, looking for even deeper aquifers.\"\n\nAs with any project, it needs to be economically viable. And that's one of the reasons Dar Si Hmad charges for its water.\n\n\"We do charge for the water, otherwise how will we keep up with the maintenance? We have aligned the prices with government prices, and we have taken 20 percent off, because we're dealing with very poor communities. But let me tell you one thing. Even with water, the moment it becomes free, it will lose its value.\"\n\nIn Chile the economic opportunities are a little different.

Ever since 1979, America has acknowledged a One-China policy and terminated formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. \n\nNo American president, cautious of provoking China, has spoken with the island's president since then. \n\nEven President Ronald Reagan, stalwart defender of democracy and opponent of communism, refused to cross any red line by speaking with the president of Taiwan. \n\nConcerns by foreign policy experts are that the call indicates Trump is a bumbling, rank amateur when it comes to foreign policy, who hasn't consulted with the State Department prior to calls with foreign leaders, and will hurt American prestige at best, or, at worst, is a loose cannon that is leading America to war with China.\n\nIn response to critics of his call, Trump has forcefully and quickly pushed back, with a series of tweets Sunday singling out China's currency policy and military posturing in the South China Sea.  \n\nBrilliant move with little downside\n\nThe reality is that Trump's move to speak on the phone with President Tsai is brilliant and has little downside. \n\nWith a simple 10-minute phone call, rather than selling billions of arms to Taiwan, Trump shows American strength in the Asia-Pacific region and may well actually making the region safer. \n\nUnlike President Barack Obama and his Asia pivot policy,  which the Chinese have generally ignored -- as evidenced by their continued reclamation of land in the South China Sea -- they are now going to pause and rethink all of their strategies to take Trump seriously. \n\nNothing is more sacred to Beijing than one-party rule and sovereignty over land and ocean that China considers its own. Everything else is open to negotiation. \n\nTrump has not said that he doesn't acknowledge the One-China policy, nor is he the actual president yet. \n\nBy having a call now before he is sworn in, he will have additional leverage to negotiate with China on more core American interests than the matter of Taiwan - for instance, open shipping lanes in the South China Sea, reduced cybersecurity risks emanating from China, and less protectionism and unfair competition for American business interests in China.\n\nPaper tiger?\n\nChina's muted response to the phone call shows Trump's strategy. \n\nInstead of launching military maneuvers as many American foreign policy experts feared, the Chinese Foreign Ministry simply lodged a complaint with the US. \n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the US must not disrupt \"the One-China policy [which] is the cornerstone of a healthy China-US relationship.\"\n\nMany China watchers thought China would react militarily. But China does not want to risk war. \n\nIn many ways China is like a paper tiger. \n\nIt is very good at bullying and shouting to get what it wants and to see how far it can push other nations, but it is not likely to risk a full-out war at this stage. \n\nIt will react militarily only if forced -- such as if Trump actually stops acknowledging the One-China policy.\n\nChinese state media downplayed the call and said that Trump is not yet president. Instead, state media unleashed their fury on President Tsai, whom they argue is intentionally trying to create war.\n\nRather than launching serious military exercises aimed at America, it is more likely that China would implement severe economic sanctions and cause trade problems with Taiwan to punish them economically. \n\nChina is currently doing the same thing with South Korea ever since it announced that it will place THAAD missile defense system on its shores. \n\nThe Chinese government is reducing the number of tour groups to South Korea; movie stars from that country have been banned from performing in China; and, recently, the giant conglomerate Lotte has had unprecedented mass audits across the country. \n\nChina previously banned Norwegian salmon after the Nobel Peace Prize was given to dissident Liu Xiaobo, and reduced trade with Mongolia after it met with the Dalai Lama.\n\nStatus quo no more?\n\nOther countries in the region only have to see the wrath of China if they oppose its strategic interests, and see the benefits if they get closer to Beijing politically. \n\nThe recent warming of ties between China, the Philippines, and Malaysia, which are getting billions of low interest loans and infrastructure investment, show Asian nations the benefits of allying with Beijing over Washington. \n\nTrump's call with President Tsai is a simple and cheap way to let other nations know that American power is back and that Trump will look after US interests, even if that means changing the status quo. \n\nAnd frankly, the status quo has not made the world a safer place in recent decades.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.7672955989837598, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 738, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.67834906594, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205130000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.607046070460701, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/02/politics/donald-trump-republicans-congress-2017/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1628, "scraper_regex": 1722}}, "headline": "Hill Republicans eye busy first 100 days of 2017", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1722, "date": "20170102120000", "story_content": "\"Buckle up\" was the advice Vice President-elect Mike Pence gave Hill Republicans about the hectic pace ahead for Capitol Hill's first 100 days in 2017. \n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress returns Tuesday to begin an aggressive push on a range of policies that their new partner -- President-elect Donald Trump -- can help turn into law. \n\nThe focus in January will be to start the wheels in motion to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and vote to confirm many of Trump's Cabinet nominees. There will also be debate about Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election -- an issue the incoming President doesn't want to focus on, saying last week it's time to \"move on\" -- but many in his own party view as a serious threat. \n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is aiming to secure confirmation for many of Trump's top national security and economic team members around the time he is sworn in on January 20. While Democrats don't have the votes to block Trump's nominees, they are signaling an intense fight nevertheless. They are planning to leverage the high-profile committee hearings to draw contrasts with Republicans on key issues like health care, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nObamacare repeal\n\n\"Repeal and replace\" has been the regular Republican refrain from virtually the day President Barack Obama's signature health care law became law in 2010. \n\nMcConnell announced last month that the first vote of the new Congress will be to start dismantling Obamacare.\n\nThe President isn't going quietly. Obama is scheduled to visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a rare meeting with all House and Senate Democrats to \"discuss fighting GOP plans to repeal (the Affordable Care Act),\" according to a senior Senate Democratic aide. The high-profile visit signals that the President will be personally involved defending the law that stands as his most important domestic policy legacy.\n\nNow that they have a GOP president to actually sign legislation that rolls back the law, congressional Republicans are acknowledging that it's complicated to simultaneously repeal Obamacare and put something else in its place. They control both the House and the Senate but they are limited because they don't have 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a Democratic filibuster that would be expected on efforts to get rid of Obamacare. \n\nTheir plan is to use a budget process known as \"reconciliation\" to wipe away the major planks of Obamacare. The Senate will begin debating a budget resolution this week as the first step. That allows them to use the procedure to pass the repeal in the Senate with a simple majority, avoiding an expected Democratic filibuster. Reconciliation rules do limit the items in the law that can be rolled back to those that have a direct impact on the federal budget, and Republicans still don't have all the details ready on which ones they will include. \n\nDemocrats are preparing an aggressive public relations campaign to highlight how Obamacare has helped the 20 million now covered because of the law, and the other benefits they believe have occurred, such as better preventive care.\n\nOn a conference call with House Democrats last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted that the ACA lowered costs and improved outcomes for millions. She compared the fight ahead against Republicans to the one she led in 2005 and 2006 when then-President George W. Bush traveled around the country championing a proposal to privatize Social Security, a plan that didn't gain traction with the public or in Congress.\n\nEvents in House congressional districts are planned for January 7, and Senate Democrats are also teeing up several events in Washington this week to remind people about the elements of Obamacare they believe are popular. \n\nPelosi, incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced that January 15 is a national \"Our First Stand: Save Health Care\" day of action for advocacy groups and Democrats to criticize Republicans for working to target the health care law, as well as other entitlement programs such as Medicare.\n\nWhile Republicans can pass the budget measure relatively quickly over a few weeks to begin unwinding Obamacare, the package that will contain the actual plans for repealing the law will take at least a couple of months to develop. Several committees in both the House and Senate will weigh in with their stamps on the details, including which taxes will go and which ones may need to remain in place until a new replacement plan is put in place.\n\nDemocrats are also bracing for a big fight over funding for Planned Parenthood, an issue that has triggered multiple standoffs in the past with the GOP. It's unclear whether Republicans will include a ban on funding for the women's health care provider because of its role in providing abortion services as part of the initial budget bill. There is no consensus yet on when to address the issue, but conservatives are pressing for action soon and view the reconciliation process as the place to tackle it.\n\nRepublicans are also struggling to come to consensus on how quickly they need to lay out their proposal to stand up a new health care system to take Obamacare's place. Conservatives are insisting they limit any transition period to two years.  \n\nBut GOP leaders are wary that once they begin unraveling the complicated federal and state programs now providing coverage, it will take three years or more to practically implement a new system. Multiple Republican aides say it's more likely that replacement plans will be voted on in a piecemeal fashion over multiple years, perhaps even after the 2018 midterm elections, to ensure there are not major marketplace disruptions or economic fallout for insurers, states or the private sector.\n\nConfirmation battles\n\nTrump's transition team describes the mix of business leaders and former military leaders selected for Cabinet posts as a group of outsiders set to shakeup the way Washington works. Republicans are confident that they have solid support and will get help of many of the red state Democrats, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, to confirm them.\n\nSo far, Rex Tillerson, the oil company CEO Trump tapped to serve as secretary of state, is the only pick who is raising some concerns with a handful of Republicans. They want more information about his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and how he will deal with myriad foreign policy issues where the US has tangled with Russia like Syria, Iran and recent cyberattacks.  \n\nDemocrats are complaining that Tillerson, and many other Cabinet nominees, have been \"very slow\" in providing information to the committees ahead of the upcoming hearings that committee chairs are targeting to hold in the second week in January. They are threatening to drag out votes on nominees if they don't receive complete financial disclosure and ethics reports in advance of hearings so Senators can review the materials.\n\nWho's in Trump's Cabinet?\n\n\"Republicans shouldn't expect their nominees to sail through if those nominees won't provide the disclosure that past nominees provided and that senators, and the American public, deserve,\" Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, told CNN. \n\nAny delay would just be symbolic, but if Democrats use the full amount of debate time allowed under Senate rules, then a vote on each nominee that would normally take place in one or two days could stretch out a week. That could mean it could take months to clear through all of the president's nominees if Democrats decide to put up a fight, and other priorities like Obamacare repeal could also be delayed. \n\nDemocrats have been critical of virtually every person Trump has selected, but they realize they can't wage war on all of them. In addition to highlighting conflicts Tillerson's business dealings might present, multiple Senate Democratic sources say they are digging into the stock trades of Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.  \n\nUnder the law known as the \"STOCK Act\" Price has disclosed information about his trades involving health and pharmaceutical company stocks. One senior Democratic leadership aide suggested they view the issue of conflicts arising from votes in Price's post as budget chair coming around the time of these financial transactions as \"seriously, seriously troubling.\" There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Price.\n\nPhil Blando, a spokesman for Trump's transition team, had previously told CNN Price \"complied fully with all applicable laws and ethics rules governing his personal finances.\" And if confirmed would comply with the law, Blando added.\n\nRussian hacking\n\nObama's announcement last week of new sanctions against Russia for its cyberattacks during the presidential election are putting Hill Republicans in a tough spot. Virtually all the top GOP leaders in Congress publicly backed the sanctions, although they criticized how long it took to put them in place, along with the administration's overall foreign policy. \n\nUS intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia carried out a steady and deliberate cyberoperation targeting top Democrats email accounts and the Democratic National Committee.  Senate Armed Service Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, is holding a Thursday hearing on the threat posed by foreign governments targeting US computer systems, including Russia, which will be the first public hearing since agencies revealed the links they found to Russia in the attacks.\n\nGet ready for another year of global tumult  \n\nMcCain, along with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, have vowed to draft legislation imposing additional sanctions to penalize Russia, and Democrats have agreed to craft a bipartisan proposal.\n\nBoth McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have publicly denounced Russia's moves, but any bipartisan push to move sanctions legislation puts them in the precarious spot of using valuable time in the first 100 days of the new administration on an issue that puts them at odds with Trump.\n\nFloor fight over rules\n\nDemocrats are criticizing new Republican proposed rules governing decorum in the chamber of the House of Representatives. In response to a summer sit-in that Democrats used to take over the House floor, GOP leaders are adding a provision to impose fines as high as $2,500 for any member who uses social media application to broadcast activities from the floor. Some Democrats are calling the proposal \"unconstitutional,\" \"a gag rule\" and \"Putinesque,\" but the changes are expected to pass. It's unclear if a legal challenge could force the GOP to back down.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.05714297294617, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1628, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 24, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 7.28975279881, "HarmVirtue": 14, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 62, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170102120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.8083538083538104, "mft_mean": 5.6363636363600005}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/13/us/wet-foot-dry-foot-reaction/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 765, "scraper_regex": 816}}, "headline": "Cuban-Americans react to end of 'wet foot, dry foot' policy", "wordcount_as_scraped": 816, "date": "20170113070000", "story_content": "Laura Vianelo remembers the stories of young Cuban migrants who \"threw themselves at the sea,\" only to die in a desperate attempt to set foot on American soil.\n\nSo, she applauded the Obama administration's abrupt end to the longstanding policy, known as \"wet foot, dry foot,\" by which the US sent back Cubans intercepted at sea but allowed those who reached land to stay. \n\nThe policy encouraged Cubans to risk their lives to seek freedom and enter the US without a visa to become permanent residents, Vianelo said.\n\n\"It is now up to the new generation, the young Cubans, to liberate themselves from communism the way it's supposed to be done, from inside Cuba,\" Vianelo said. \n\nShe was among scores of Cuban-Americans who gathered Thursday at the popular Versailles Restaurant in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood to discuss the policy change. Some expressed displeasure. Others said the change could ultimately be a boon for the island nation. \n\nThe policy had applied solely to Cubans. An even less restrictive \"open door\" policy for Cubans was established by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s. But in the 1990s -- following a mass exodus of Cubans to the United States -- President Bill Clinton amended the rule to state that the US would send back seafaring Cubans who hadn't yet reached US soil.\n\nBecause Clinton's \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy still allowed visa-less Cubans to stay if they reached land, other immigrants, including Haitians, have long criticized it. Non-Cubans who enter the country without a visa generally are arrested and deported. \n\nTreating Cubans like other migrants\n\nOrlando Silva, a Miami doctor who fled Cuba with his family and never went back, said the policy change \"is another betrayal by this country\" that favors communism.\n\nThe United States has \"always been against this country,\" he said of his native homeland.\n\nA senior administration official said the US Department of Homeland Security would eliminate the policy that made Cuban nationals eligible for resident status within a year.\n\nImmediately, Cubans \"who attempt to enter the United States illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief will be subject to removal, consistent with US law and enforcement priorities,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\n\"By taking this step, we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries,\" the statement said.\n\nMedical parole program also eliminated\n\nCuba's government also agreed to accept Cuban nationals who have been ordered removed from the United States, just as they had accepted migrants intercepted at sea under the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy, the White House said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security also eliminated a policy for Cuban medical professionals known as the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, a senior administration official said.\n\nMiami-Dade County, Florida, Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez, whose county boasts a large Cuban-American population, said he was disappointed by the decision to end the medical parole program.\n\n\"The duties of the doctors who were previously protected by this program will continue to be mandated by the Cuban dictatorship,\" Gimenez said in a statement. \"These doctors have been used as instruments of the regime and sadly, the elimination of the program will negatively impact their ability to practice medicine freely. \n\nGimenez also said eliminating the \"wet foot, dry foot policy\" would \"undoubtedly impact\" the Cuban-American community. But while the old policy granted relief to many fleeing persecution, the mayor said he was concerned it \"was being abused and required adjustments.\"\n\nFamily Reunification Parole Program unaffected \n\nFederal officials said the DHS is also eliminating an exemption that had prevented the use of expedited removal proceedings for Cuban nationals apprehended at ports of entry or near the border.\n\nThe existing Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program, which allows certain eligible US citizens and lawful permanent residents to apply for parole for their family members in Cuba, is unaffected, the official said.\n\nThe \"wet foot, dry foot\" change was likely to be Obama's last move in his historic dealings with Cuba, In 2014, Obama reopened ties to the island nation after a half century of frozen diplomatic ties.\n\nCould real change now come to Cuba?\n\nIn November, Cuba's longtime leader Fidel Castro died at age 90. Castro's younger brother, Raul, who had been running the island nation for more than a decade, plans to step down in 2018. \n\nMusic producer Armando Flores, a second-generation Cuban, said the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy was \"an escape valve\" for Cubans under the Castro regime. But the policy change may bring out transformation of the government, he said. \n\n\"Lots of things can happen, like a rebellion or a bigger focus on these Cubans that want to make a profound and real change in Cuba now that this bridge isn't there... there's no escape,\" he said. \n\nBut Flores said it is now \"unfortunate for those who really come to the US looking for liberty and ... find themselves in this situation.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 25, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.6029592752456698, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 765, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.955585186689999, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 25, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.35947712418301, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/09/health/women-insurance-trumpcare/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 838, "scraper_regex": 891}}, "headline": "Beyond birth control, how Trumpcare might affect women", "wordcount_as_scraped": 891, "date": "20161209100000", "story_content": "As the prospect began to sink in of losing access to free contraceptives if the health law is repealed or replaced, women have reportedly been racing to get IUDs or stockpile birth control  pills before President Barack Obama leaves office. \n\nBut birth control is just the tip of the iceberg, advocates say.

But the Affordable Care Act required that care be included as one of the 10 essential health benefits that all individual plans must cover. \n\nIn 2009, the year before the health law passed, just 13 percent of individual plans that were available to a 30-year-old woman in all the state capitals offered maternity benefits, according to an analysis by the National Women's Law Center.\n\nSome plans offered maternity services as an add-on through a special rider that paid a fixed dollar amount, sometimes just a few thousand dollars, the study found. But even with a rider, a woman's financial exposure could be significant: The average total payment for a vaginal birth was $18,329 in 2010, according to a study (PDF) by Truven Health Analytics.\n\nWomen were also generally charged higher rates for health insurance on the individual market before the law. \n\nAccording to the National Women's Law Center's analysis, 60 percent of best-selling individual plans in 2009 charged a 40-year-old non-smoking woman more than a 40-year-old man who smoked, even in plans that didn't include any type of maternity coverage. That inequity disappeared under the health law, which prohibited insurers from charging women higher rates than men for the same services.\n\n\"Our concern is going back to a world where insurance companies are writing their own rules again, and returning women to those bad old days in health care and losing all the progress we've made,\" said Gretchen Borchelt, vice president for reproductive rights and health at the law center.\n\nSeveral other women's preventive health services could be on the line if the health law is repealed or changed. Some may be easier to get rid of than others, say women's health policy experts.\n\nUnder the law, preventive services that are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force have to be covered without cost sharing. The task force, an independent panel of medical experts, evaluates the scientific evidence for screenings, medications and services and publishes several new or updated recommendations annually. Current recommendations that affect women include guidelines for screening for breast and cervical cancer and testing for the BRCA 1 and 2 genetic mutations that increase women's risk of breast cancer.\n\n\"Coverage of those services can't be changed without a change to the statute\" that created the health law, said Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. If the law is repealed, then that could happen.\n\nThere's another group of required preventive services for women that could be even easier to eliminate, however. \n\nUnder the law, women's preventive services that are endorsed by the Health Resources and Services Administration have to be covered by most insurers without cost sharing as well. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine proposed a list of eight preventive services that should be covered, and HRSA adopted them. Among them was the requirement that most insurers cover all FDA-approved contraceptives without charging women anything out-of-pocket. \n\nAlso included were requirements to cover well-woman visits at least once a year, screening for gestational diabetes, counseling and screening for sexually transmitted infections, breastfeeding support, counseling and supplies, and screening and counseling for domestic violence.\n\nA committee of women's health providers led by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has proposed an update to the current guidelines that is under review by federal officials.\n\n\"We expect action will be taken before the end of this administration,\" said Palanker.\n\nBut the Trump administration may not have the same ideas about which preventive benefits (PDF) for women should be endorsed. The new secretary of Health And Human Services could opt for different decisions than the Obama administration.\n\n\"What they can endorse they can also unendorse,\" said Adam Sonfield, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization for reproductive health based in Washington, D.C.\n\nFinally, many of the details about what's required to comply with the law have been in the form of thousands of pages of regulations and guidance. A new administration could write different rules or just not enforce the ones that are on the books, advocates warn. \n\nTake birth control. \n\nSome health plans initially interpreted the requirement to cover FDA-approved contraceptives to mean that if they covered birth control pills, for example, they didn't have to cover other hormonal methods of contraception such as the vaginal ring or patch. Federal officials under Obama have declared that insurers couldn't pick and choose; they had to cover all 18 FDA-approved methods (PDF) of birth control.\n\n\"A lot of the pieces of the preventive services benefits that clarify and make the coverage real and strong has been through [federal officials'] guidance [that interprets the health law], and there is fear that could be changed,\" Palanker said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.67665958404541, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 838, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 20, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.78113203476, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 42, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.01193317422434, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/16/opinions/why-we-lost-aleppo/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Why we lost Aleppo", "wordcount_as_scraped": 712, "date": "20161216120000", "story_content": "In the summer of 2012, with fewer than 500 fighters and in under a week, the Free Syrian Army took control of 70 neighbourhoods of the city of Aleppo. It happened during the month of Ramadan -- the residents of the city gave us food and drink to break our fast.\n\nWe liberated the city from Assad's government forces to protect the residents from his brutal crackdown. We were not interested in money, power or control. We simply wanted to fight for the dignity and freedom of the people.\n\nIt was an Odyssey. We had been coordinating with sleeper cells inside the city for four months in advance. That's why when the revolutionaries entered Aleppo from the suburbs it practically fell from the regime's control right away.\n\nFor the next year, people enjoyed the freedom that they had always longed for. Protests against the regime were taking place every day. Coordination committees, a provincial council, and municipal bodies had sprung up to manage the city.\n\nBut since the end of 2013, the situation began to change and we began to lose Aleppo for various reasons.\n\nFirst, there was ISIS. This group initially fought on our side, but then stabbed us in the back and began fighting us. The revolutionaries who initially came to the city of Aleppo from the suburbs of Maree, Atareb, Azaz, Tal Rifaat, al-Bab and Jarablus had to return to their villages and towns to defend them from ISIS.\n\nOn top of trying to maintain our gains in Aleppo from the regime, we had fierce battles with ISIS in the outskirts. In those battles, many of the fighters who led the Aleppo battles were kidnapped or assassinated. Others had to flee to Turkey in fear of assassination. Our battle with ISIS continues to this very day. They left behind booby traps that continue to kill people in the suburbs of Aleppo on a daily basis.\n\nSimultaneously, we found ourselves fighting against the YPG -- the Syrian offshoot of the Kurdish militant group PKK -- who wanted to take over areas liberated from ISIS [that were essential to connecting the western and eastern semi-autonomous Kurdish areas in Syria.\n\nThe involvement of Russia in Syria played an integral role in tipping the balance back to the regime. Russia adopted a scorched earth policy, burning everything in eastern Aleppo to prevent the fighters from hiding anywhere. The Russians used all kinds of heavy weaponry, including those that are internationally prohibited.\n\nWith the help of Russia, the regime was able to advance significantly. On the ground, it  had the full backing of Hezbollah and other Shia militias. Assad had solid backing from his allies.\n\nMeanwhile, the financial and military support the opposition fighters received actually divided us. The US and its allies in the region supported different groups with different types of support, causing disunity and infighting among the rebels. There was an effort to sideline the senior officers who defected from Assad's army at the beginning.\n\nLast year, I myself tried to return to Aleppo to help in the battle, but I found no place. I was given no tools nor the authority to achieve anything. Those who were supported -- while dedicated to the cause -- had no military experience whatsoever. If we look at the fighters in Aleppo now, there is not a single qualified military officer.\n\nIn my opinion, it seems that the US and its allies were not really interested in us defeating Assad. They were interested in keeping the battles going as. I can't think of any other reason as to why experienced officers would be sidelined.\n\nBeside the solid support Assad is getting from his loyal allies, it's worth mentioning that since last year, the regime began to enter into reconciliation initiatives with opposition groups in other parts of the country, including Deraa and the suburbs of Damascus. With those frontlines being cold, the regime was able to focus its full manpower on Aleppo.\n\nThese are the factors which I believe have led to we are today. But I am not regretful. In fact, I am proud of my work and my leadership of the Aleppo battles. There was no other way to do this. \n\nThe fight is not over, but the tree of freedom can only be nurtured with blood.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.9505851268768302, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 729, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.41363333737, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.4293552812071297, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/asia/jayaraman-jayalalithaa-obit/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2123, 2127, 2391, 3588, 3619, 4069, 4310, 5818, 6135, 6306, 7064]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1054, "scraper_regex": 1173}}, "headline": "Jayaraman Jayalalithaa, 'goddess' of Indian politics, dies at 68", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1173, "date": "20161206030000", "story_content": "Jayaraman Jayalalithaa, one of India's most powerful politicians and the only female chief minister to be elected in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, has died.

She was admitted to Apollo Hospitals in Chennai, the capital of her state, on September 22, complaining of fever and dehydration. \n\nHer doctors said she suffered a cardiac arrest on Sunday, December 4. Nearing midnight on Monday, Apollo Hospitals released a statement saying \"every possible attempt was made to sustain her,\" before announcing her death.\n\nJayalalithaa ji's connect with citizens, concern for welfare of the poor, the women & marginalized will always be a source of inspiration.\u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) December 5, 2016\n\nDespite the late hour, Indian leaders were quick to offer their condolences. \n\nIndia's President Pranab Mukherjee took to Twitter to say \"her contribution to the progress and development of Tamil Nadu will be long remembered.\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi also tweeted, saying her \"concern for welfare of the poor, the women, and the marginalized will always be a source of inspiration.\"\n\nTamil Nadu has declared seven days of state mourning, and shut schools and colleges for three days.\n\nCinema star\n\nJayalalithaa, a popular former Tamil cinema star, embodied the blurred lines between celebrity and government that define the state's politics.\n\nFor her supporters, she was adulated like a living Hindu goddess. \n\nWhen she won her most recent election in 2016, they held prayer ceremonies in her honor across the state. On the eve of her death, hundreds of them gathered outside the hospital, desperate to hear about the fate of their idol.\n\nShe inspired a cult following, and adoring followers often called her \"Adi parashakti\" - which means the ultimate powerful goddess #RIPAmma pic.twitter.com/LCXLIxIcdF\u2014 \u0909\u0921\u093c\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0948\u0936\u0932\u0947\u0938 \u0924\u0940\u0930 (@terikahkelunga) December 6, 2016\n\n\"For all of us women, she is a protector. We\u00a0can\u00a0walk boldly on the streets,\" A. Jaya, a 50-year old housewife standing by the hospital, said. \"Girls have greater self-confidence because they see her and get inspired.\"\n\nJaya had arrived there Sunday night and spent the whole night outside, sitting with a friend\u00a0under the awnings of shops located half a kilometer away from the hospital.\n\nBut Jayalalithaa was controversial. To her critics, she was a powerful and corrupt politician who abused her privilege. \n\nShe and those close to her were accused of buying government land at suspiciously low prices and violating environmental laws to give businessmen breaks. She threw a lavish wedding for an adopted son using state resources. Lawsuits would plague her for most of her political career.\n\nShe died surrounded by her political party machinery, as thousands of supporters waited outside the hospital.\n\nFrom film star to leading politician\n\nJayalalithaa lived much of her life in the public eye, first as an actress and later as the politician. She started acting at the age of 15 and would go on to star in 125 films.\n\nIt was on a movie set that she met M.G. Ramachandran, the film actor and politician who dominated Tamil Nadu's political scene in the decades after India's independence. She starred in 28 films with him as his heroine and developed a close relationship with him off-screen. \n\nHe also introduced her to politics, making her the propaganda secretary of his political party, the All India\u00a0Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam\u00a0or the AIADMK, when he later became chief minister.\n\nAfter Ramachandran's death in 1987, there was a vacuum in the party. Jayalalithaa struggled to claim the spot as his political heir against his widow, Janaki. It was to be a fight marked with public humiliations. \n\nAt Ramachandran's funeral procession, Jayalalithaa climbed on to the carriage meant for family and those who were close with him, only to be pushed out by one of his family members.\u00a0Jayalalithaa fell to the ground.\n\nThe humiliating moment was captured and broadcast on TV and became her turning point in the public eye, said R. K. Radhakrishnan, an editor at Frontline magazine in Chennai. It generated a lot of sympathy. \u00a0\n\nWithin four years of that incident, Jayalalithaa campaigned and consolidated her support among the party, emerging as their candidate for Chief Minister in 1991. She was easily elected that year.\n\nA practiced politician\n\nHer win was historic as the first elected female Chief Minister. Her governance, however, was often criticized. Jayalalithaa regularly filed defamation suits against journalists and opposition politicians.\n\nAll the same, she could be very charming to those who she liked, Radhakrishnan said. \"The thing is if she wants to turn the charm on ... You're going to melt.\"\n\nJayalalithaa was voted out of office after her first term. Her chief political rival Karunanidhi became Chief Minister and his government filed several cases against her in court alleging massive corruption. In 2014, she was convicted of a corruption charge, before a higher court overturned the verdict on appeal. She spent a few weeks behind bars, which only increased her appeal among her followers who believed her prosecution was a political witch hunt.\n\nOver the years, she became a larger-than-life figure. Her most recent win was during the elections in 2016, which her party won with an overwhelming mandate. With her death, the party named a top functionary, O. Panneerselvam, as the new Chief Minister.\n\nTamil Nadu's mother\n\nJayalalithaa's popularity can perhaps be gauged by the fact that she was almost universally known by her a nickname: \"Amma,\" or mother. Her sari-clad image projected a caring, warm\u00a0maternal figure -- someone who could take care of the people.\n\nThat image was is in large part fueled by her welfare schemes, where the state doled out everything from cement to laptops to bicycles. She also started a chain of Amma canteens, where a person can get a full meal for less than five rupees ($0.08 USD). \u00a0\n\n\"We have got everything because of Amma,\" said Kannika, a 53-year old housewife who was waiting outside the hospital on Monday. \"Without her, there's nobody for us.\" \n\n\u00a0Yet, Jayalalithaa's private life was rarely on display in contrast to her familial reputation in public. She never married or had children. Both her mother and brother have died, leaving her without any close relatives.\n\nShe would recall in later interviews that she did not have much warmth in her childhood. \"I've never really been satiated with the kind of love I expected and wanted and needed from my mother,\" she said in a 1999 interview with Simi Garewal on a popular talk show. She later added in the same interview, \"I don't think there is anything as unconditional love.\"\n\nShe was, nevertheless, very successful in building an image as the people's mother -- and it seemed to be her life's work. \n\nUpon winning her last election in 2015, she said:\u00a0\"My life has been dedicated to the people all of these years. It will continue to be so. I will continue to strive for the betterment of this state and the people of the state until my last breath.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.853242337703705, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1054, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.71044433838, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161206030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.32827324478178, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/13/travel/best-ski-resort-in-france-la-grave/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1179, "scraper_regex": 1295}}, "headline": "La Grave: Is it all downhill for one of France's best ski resorts?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1295, "date": "20170113110000", "story_content": "Its sheer slopes might be a cult off-piste ski destination and a haven for helmeted hardcores, but France's La Grave resort sits at an existential crossroads.\n\nAn aging, solitary cable car is the village's lifeblood, but the lease is up for renewal in 2017 and the community fears for the future.\n\nLocals worry a big-business operator -- interested purely in profit -- will take over and destroy the soul of this unique alpine niche resort.\n\nInto the abyss\n\nHowever, La Grave is struggling. People are moving away, and there's a tacit acknowledgment that investment is needed to revive fortunes.   \n\n\"Everyone is afraid of the unknown,\" says Pelle Lang, a Swedish guide who owns the Skiers' Lodge in the village. \"There are a lot of people who have spent many years here, and it means a lot to them because La Grave is a special place.\"\n\nThe tiny 12th-century village in France's Ecrins National Park gives access to acres of adventure on the flanks of La Meije, a wild and remote 3,984-meter (13,071-foot) mountain, some 60 miles southwest of Mont Blanc.\n\nMORE: World's best ski resorts 1-100\n\nNo room for cruisers\n\nThis is no place for \"blues cruisers\" -- skiers who prefer intermediate pistes that offer limited challenges. There's one short groomed slope. \n\nThe rest is a mountainscape of glaciers, cliffs, crevasses, couloirs and forests -- and a dream for free skiers and their guides when the conditions are right.\n\n\"It is just an incredibly unique area and a special place, not only for skiing, but ski touring alpinistes, mountain bikers in the summer and farming,\" adds Lang, who pioneered the region as a hardcore skiing hub.\n\nThe only way up is via a 40-year-old cable car which takes 40 minutes to chug up via two intermediary stations from the rugged village at 1,480 meters to a high point of 3,200 meters.\n\nThere's one other lift, a rudimentary drag next to the single ribbon of piste high up on the glacier, rising to 3,530 meters just below the Dome de la Lauze.\n\nMORE: 10 of the world's most beautiful ski lodges \n\nSnow business\n\nThe extensive ski resort of Les Deux Alpes lies just over the ridge. It's another world, of commercialization and big business, but one that threatens to engulf La Grave. \n\nThe lift has a capacity of 400 people per hour, and struggles to make money. The lift's designer, Denis Creissels, a man in his 80s, took over the lease in 1987 and runs the company at the margins of profitability.\n\nFor several years, rumors abounded that the lift would simply close when the lease ran out. The lift did stop for a spell in the 1980s when an earlier operator went bankrupt.\n\n\"I have had American clients ringing me up saying 'I want to ski La Grave because this is the last year the lift will run',\" says Lang. \"It has a bad reputation around the world.\"\n\nTwo contenders\n\nHowever, six potential investors came forward and were whittled down to two by the mayor's office, with a final decision to be made in March. The identities of the two prospective leaseholders remain a closely guarded secret.\n\nThe worry among locals is that a mega lift company, such as Compagnie des Alpes, which runs many of France's top resorts including nearby Les Deux Alpes, Chamonix and Val d'Isere, will implement big changes to increase profitability and satisfy shareholders. \n\n\"Now, we as skiers adapt to the mountain,\" says Lang. \"As soon as you start adapting the mountain to the skier, you're bringing bigger crowds and soon you have a bigger demand for services.\"\n\nMORE: These ski resorts are Europe's best-kept secrets\n\nCrowdfunding venture\n\nLocals are not \"anti-development,\" but they're wary that turning La Grave into a slick resort will rip the heart out of an authentic and pristine alpine environment. \n\nThe added fear is the village will be neglected in favor of unsustainable property development.\n\nBelgian resident Joost Van Zundert launched a crowdfunding venture to protect what he calls \"this special place\" for the community. \n\nIt attracted \u20ac61,000 ($64,000) from 1,012 backers to raise awareness, with the private investment already lined up for the next phase, but his was one of the bids rejected by the town hall.\n\n\"The worst-case scenario for me is an operator who doesn't develop the village life and just operates the lift and thinks about its profits, not the product itself,\" says Van Zundert, who relocated to La Grave in 2005.\n\n\"That could endanger the authenticity of the skiing.\"\n\n'Extremely serious'\n\nLa Grave is a serious mountain requiring specialist skills to negotiate its slopes. \n\nOf the 23 \"legendary routes\" pictured on Lang's Skiers' Lodge website, 16 have a technical difficulty rating of \"very serious\" or \"extremely serious.\"\n\nThere have been a number of fatalities over the years, including big-name American skier Doug Coombs who died after a fall in the Couloir de Polichinelle in 2006. \n\nNot for nothing does La Grave have the second highest population of mountain guides in the world after Chamonix, at the foot of Mont Blanc.\n\n\"It attracts skiers from all around the world, experienced skiers and people who have a dream or ambition to ski there,\" adds Van Zundert, whose group will continue to lobby for the preservation of La Grave.\n\nMORE: Why Iran could be your next ski destination \n\nCommercial concerns\n\nBoosting numbers, with enhanced lift and accommodation infrastructure, or by connecting La Grave into the lift system of nearby Les Deux Alpes, could engulf the village and attract visitors without the necessary experience and equipment.\n\nBut La Grave faces a delicate dilemma. \n\nWithout investment, the prospects are gloomy. \n\nThe situation has not been helped by the collapse of a tunnel on the road to La Grave, blocking the western access for almost two years. \n\nThe alternative, a winding four-hour diversion to the east, severely hit businesses, although the tunnel's re-opening this winter will give the village some much-needed \"oxygen,\" according to Van Zundert. \n\n\"It's so difficult to make money here. And people are very tired living with this stress,\" adds Lang.\n\n\"The sad thing now is that many people are moving away from La Grave, schools are declining, it's been a tough time for people here.\"\n\nFat checkbooks \n\nSecuring the future of the lift is vital, but the flipside is that big companies waving checkbooks at impoverished landowners could hasten the exodus and expansion. \n\nThen again, one of the stipulations of the new lease will be to build a third stage of the cable car up to 3,600 meters, replacing the old drag lift, before 2021. \n\nNot only will this allow easier liaisons with Les Deux Alpes but it's hoped it will extend the season and increase summer traffic.\n\n\"They've been trying to open the lift up for summer skiing since they built it but they have never been able to make any money,\" says Lang. \n\n\"But if there is a cable car up to 3,600 meters it will compete with the Aiguille du Midi in Chamonix. \n\n\"The view is stunning. You can see to Italy and the Monte Rosa, to Mont Blanc, to the Massif Central, Mont Ventoux...\"\n\nMORE: Where the pros go for snow\n\nNo artificial snow\n\nAmong the other terms of the lease: No new pistes will be allowed and artificial snow making will be banned to preserve the authenticity of the environment. Lift improvements could also clean up some of the old infrastructure on the mountain.\n\nBut locals worry some of these seemingly positive upsides will be lost amid big-money negotiations.\n\n\"We pray they will come up with a solution and a good long-term working relationship with either of the companies,\" says Lang.\n\nLike much of its skiing, La Grave is on a precipice.

It's now time to move on and 'Make America Great Again.'\"\n\nThe sharp pushback to revelations in The Washington Post, which followed an earlier CNN report on alleged Russian interference in the election, represented a startling rebuke from an incoming White House to the CIA.\n\nRELATED: Democrats want Russian hacking intelligence declassified\n\nThe transition team's reference to the agency's most humiliating recent intelligence misfire \u2014 over its conclusion that Iraq under Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction \u2014 threatens to cast an early cloud over relations between the Trump White House and the CIA, whose assessments he'll need to make monumental decisions. \n\nThe top leadership of the agency that presided over the Iraq failure during the Bush administration has long since been replaced. But the comments from Trump's camp will cause concern in the Intelligence community about the incoming President's attitude to America's spy agencies. CNN reported this week that Trump is getting intelligence briefings only once a week. Several previous presidents preparing for the inauguration had a more intense briefing schedule.\n\nMultiple sources with knowledge of the investigation into Russia's hacking told CNN last week that the US intelligence community is increasingly confident that Russian meddling in the US election was intended to steer the election toward Trump, rather than simply to undermine or in other ways disrupt the political process.\n\nOn Friday, the Post cited US officials as saying that intelligence agencies have identified individuals connected to the Russian government who gave Wikileaks thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nSenate Democrats responded to the news Friday and Saturday by calling on the Intelligence community to turn over to Congress as much relevant information on the subject of Russian hacking to Congress.\n\n\"That any country could be meddling in our elections should shake both political parties to their core,\" incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \"Senate Democrats will join with our Republican colleagues next year to demand a congressional investigation and hearings to get to the bottom of this.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said there is no evidence to suggest that President Vladimir Putin's Russia, with which he has vowed to improve relations, played a nefarious role in the US election.\n\n\"I don't believe it. I don't believe they interfered,\" Trump said in an interview for the latest issue of Time magazine, adding that he thought intelligence community accusations about Russian interventions in the election were politically motivated.\n\nTrump has also been highly sensitive to any suggestion that he did not win the election fair and square, including claiming that he is only trailing Clinton in the popular vote because of a huge trove of illegal votes -- a claim for which he has provided no evidence.\n\nHis surrogates including Republican National Committee Communications Director Sean Spicer underscored the point Saturday that there's little evidence that Russian hacking would have affected the overall outcome of the election.\n\n\"What proof does anyone have that they effected the outcome because I've heard zero,\" he said in a heated conversation with CNN's Michael Smerconsih. \"Show me what facts have actually shown that anything undermined that election.\"\n\nEarlier Friday, the White House said that President Barack Obama had ordered a full review into hacking aimed at influencing US elections going back to 2008.\n\nRussia has demanded evidence of its alleged involvement in the election and denied any wrongdoing.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.38983058929443, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 502, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.49627822141, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161210060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.98804780876494, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/05/us/justin-ross-harris-sentence/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 619, "scraper_regex": 840}}, "headline": "Justin Ross Harris sentenced to life for son's hot-car death", "wordcount_as_scraped": 840, "date": "20161205150000", "story_content": "A judge has sentenced suburban Atlanta father Justin Ross Harris to life in prison without parole for the murder of his 22-month-old son, Cooper, who died in 2014 after Harris left him in a hot car for seven hours while he went to work. \n\nHarris also received another 32 years, to be served consecutively, for convictions on four other counts. \n\nHarris, 36, who appeared in an orange jumpsuit with his wrists shackled at his waist, cast his head slightly downward as the sentence was handed down. He briefly closed his eyes but offered little other reaction. \n\nIn addition to the life term, Cobb County Superior Court Judge Mary Staley Clark gave Harris a 20-year sentence on a conviction for first-degree cruelty to children and another 10 years for sexual exploitation of children. Those charges stemmed from a finding that Harris tried to convince a minor to text him photos of her genitalia. \n\nHarris also received a year each on two misdemeanor counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors, also related to his texts. \n\nHarris' legal team offered no mitigating circumstances or evidence ahead of the sentencing. Assistant District Attorney Chuck Boring told the court that this was a matter of the defense team's \"trial strategy.\"\n\n\"There's not much to argue or say,\" Boring said. \"The jury verdict basically says it all.\"\n\nThe only sentence that matches the \"evil nature\" of Harris' crimes, Boring said, is life in prison. Staley concurred. \n\nThe sentencing doesn't mean the headline-grabbing case is over. Harris' lawyers, who claimed the boy's death was a tragic accident brought about by a lapse in memory, say they intend to file a motion for a new trial. \n\nBut prosecutors had argued that Harris intentionally locked his son inside his Hyundai Tucson that day because he wanted to be free of his family responsibilities. \n\nThe incident\n\nIt was June 18, 2014, when Harris strapped his son into a rear-facing car seat and drove from their Marietta, Georgia, home to Chick-fil-A for breakfast, then to The Home Depot corporate headquarters, where he worked. Instead of dropping Cooper off at day care, Harris left him in the car all day, testimony revealed.\n\nSometime after 4 p.m. that day, as Harris drove to a nearby theater to see a movie, he noticed his son was still in the car. He pulled into a shopping center parking lot and pulled Cooper's body from the SUV. Witnesses said he appeared distraught and was screaming.\n\n\"'I love my son and all, but we both need escapes.' Those words were uttered 10 minutes before this defendant, with a selfish abandon and malignant heart, did exactly that,\" Cobb County Assistant District Attorney Chuck Boring said in his closing argument.\n\nHot car deaths: How can parents forget a child in a car?\n\nThe evidence\n\nThe prosecution argued that Harris could see his son sitting in his car seat in the SUV.\n\n\"If this child was visible in that car, that is not a failure in memory systems,\" Boring argued. \"Cooper would have been visible to anyone inside that car. Flat out.\" \n\nIf Cooper were visible, Boring said, \"the defendant is guilty of all counts.\"\n\nAfter the verdict, jurors told the prosecution the evidence weighed heavily in their decision, Boring said.\n\nDay by Day: Key moments from the Justin Ross Harris trial\n\nDigital evidence showed that on the day his son died, Harris exchanged sexual messages and photos with six women, including one minor. \n\nState witnesses testified that Harris lived what prosecutors described as a \"double life.\" \n\nTo his wife, family, friends and co-workers, Harris was seen as a loving father and husband. Unbeknownst to them, Harris engaged in online sexual communication with multiple women, including two underage girls, had extramarital sexual encounters in public places and paid for sex with a prostitute. \n\nHarris' defense maintained his sexual behavior had nothing to do with Cooper's death.\n\n\"The state wants to bury him in this filth and dirt of his own making, so that you will believe he is so immoral, he is so reprehensible that he can do exactly this,\" said defense attorney H. Maddox Kilgore during his closing argument. \n\nKilgore argued that Cobb County police investigators focused only on matters that fit the state's theory and ignored all the evidence that pointed to an accident.  \n\n\"You have been misled throughout this trial,\" Kilgore told jurors. \n\nThe main defense witness: Harris' ex-wife \n\nThe defense's key witness was Harris' ex-wife and Cooper's mother, Leanna Taylor. \n\n\"Cooper was the sweetest little boy. He had so much life in him. He was everything to me,\" Taylor recalled, as she seemed to fight through tears. \n\nTaylor told jurors private details of her married life with Harris, saying they had intimacy problems and recounting Harris' struggles with pornography. \n\nThe Justin Ross Harris case: What you need to know\n\nMarital struggles aside, Taylor described Harris as a \"very involved\" parent who loved their son. In her mind, she said, the only possible explanation was that Harris forgot Cooper and accidentally left him in the car.

While it's a lovely showing of civic pride, selfies with your ballot could get you in trouble -- even if you are Justin Timberlake. So, before you pull the lever on Election Day, know the states that allow: \n\n\n\nNo selfies | Some selfies | All selfies \n\nNot down with your selfie desires \n\nPut away your phones, because these states don't allow photographs in polling places or voting booths  -- or both. Granted the laws aren't often enforced. (It's more of a \"someone gently asks you to stop\" kind of thing.)  But that doesn't mean you should test the rules. \n\nAlabama: No photos at polling places. That being said, no one's been prosecuted and any violators will simply be asked to stop. \n\nArizona: You can't take photos inside or within 75 feet of a polling place. You CAN take a photo of a ballot that was mailed to you. \n\nCalifornia: Ballot selfies WILL be legal in California ...in January 2017. As of now, they're against the law ... that isn't really enforced. \n\nColorado: There are two pending cases that may overturn the law, but for now it's illegal to take pics AND to share or show your completed ballot to another person. \n\nFlorida: No go in voting places. Yes to pics of mail-in ballots. \n\nGeorgia: Can't take pics at a polling place, or of any ballots or voting equipment. The Secretary of State's office says it \"strongly discourage[s] ballot selfies.\"\n\nIllinois: It's a felony to take pictures that show how you voted, and it's also illegal to take pictures inside polling places. If you do get popped for a violation, the state Election Board says the case would be decided on the county level. \n\nIowa: No photos are allowed in the voting booths, but the law's unclear on whether that also means polling places. \n\nMaryland: Maryland goes a level beyond, and actually bans the use of any electronic communication devices. That, obviously, means you can't take pics of ballots either. \n\nMichigan: There's a legal back-and-forth going on, but for now, no cameras in polling places. \n\nNevada: Can't take pictures in polling places, because it's considered photographing \"the conduct of voting.\" \n\nNorth Carolina: The only way you can take pictures is if you have the permission of the voter (you) -- and the permission of the chief judge of the precinct (not you). So, it's probably a pass. \n\nTennessee: Tennessee's laws are kinda unclear, because they state \"no phones\" but also have a mobile app to help with voting. However, the law also says you can't take pictures or talk on the phone. Take a lesson from Justin Timberlake: It's not worth the hassle. \n\nTexas: No photos inside the booths or within 100 feet of the polling place. If you do get caught, you won't be arrested, per se, but you will be asked to stop. And why would you want to inconvenience people with all of that? \n\nWest Virginia: Here's the law: \"No person may enter a voting booth with any recording or electronic device in order to record or interfere with the voting process.\" So, basically, no selfies. However, once you're outside the precinct, snap away. \n\nBack to top\n\nExercise selfie restraint\n\nLots of state laws don't specifically cover voting booth pictures, but are pretty clear on marked ballots. There's plenty of reasons why this is totally understandable, but the most important one has to do with vote buying. There's no way anyone can know who you voted for unless you provide them with photo evidence. \n\nAlaska: There's a statute in the books prohibiting selfies with your ballot, but no one's been prosecuted. The state says it's considered creating a PSA reminding voters of ballot secrecy. \n\nMassachusetts: No selfies with your ballot, people. But here again, there's little the state can do to enforce the law, says Brian McNiff, spokesman for the Secretary of the Commonwealth. \n\nMinnesota: Two statues say showing others your marked ballot is a no-no. And that's what taking a pic or a video does. \n\nMississippi: Just don't in Mississippi. In 2008 & 2012, some teens who were voting for the 1st time broke the law. The Attorney General fined them $25.  Your fine could be higher -- up to $100, says Holly Robertson of the State Board of Elections.\n\nMissouri: The law here, like the others in this list, deals with showing your ballot. So, Stephanie Fleming of the Secretary of State's Office says, check with your polling place just to be sure before you start snapping.\n\nNew Jersey: There are moves to change the law, but for now you can't show your completed ballot to others, which means no pictures of it. \n\nNew Mexico: The law says no showing your completed ballot to anyone. Ken Ortiz of the Secretary of State's Office says the law's hard to enforce and nobody's been prosecuted under it.\n\nNew York: Don't take a picture of your ballot. Simple. \n\nSouth Carolina: Selfies of your ballot = Against the law. But Chris Whitmire with the state Election Office didn't know if anyone's ever been prosecuted for it.\n\nSouth Dakota: Don't take a picture of your ballot. Mark it, fold it, refold it and cast your vote.\n\nWisconsin: The state would rather you not take a pic with your marked ballot. Reid Magney of the Election Commission says he's not aware of any prosecutions, but why open yourself up to a complaint?\n\nBack to top\n\nSelfie expression is fine\n\nHere's the bottom line: Voting is a serious affair, and states would like to protect the sanctity of this American right. If you still simply must selfie, go ahead. Just consider the inimitable words of Ian Malcom from Jurassic Park: You may be so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you may not stop to think if you should. \n\nArkansas: The only law here is that you are allowed to cast your vote in private, says Daniel Schultz with the Board of Elections. \n\nConnecticut:  Snap away. \n\nDelaware: There's no specific law against any of this, but officials do encourage people not to use their cellphones in polling places. \n\nHawaii: Okay, so, you can take a selfie in the voting booth, and you can share photos of your marked ballot. However, according to Nedielyn Bueno of the Office of Elections, you can't take selfies OUTSIDE the voting booth because polling places don't allow the use of electronic devices. \n\nIdaho: There are now laws against it, but photography is discouraged. \n\nIndiana: The state enacted a law that banned ballot selfies. But a federal judge barred it from going into effect. So, you're good to go ... for now.\n\nKansas: Election Director Brian Caskey with the Board of Elections says there's a law about ballot disclosure, but ballot selfies don't fall under it. \n\nKentucky: Good to go. \n\nLouisiana: Selfies are allowed because your vote is private until YOU make it public!\n\nMaine: Snap away.\n\nMontana: Snap away.\n\nNebraska: Snap away.\n\nNew Hampshire: A federal appeals court ruled a statewide ballot selfie ban unconstitutional. So you're good to go.\n\nNorth Dakota: No issues here.\n\nOhio: \"The Secretary does not believe posting a photo of your vote on social media is a problem,\" says Joshua Eck, the spokesman for the Secrety of State's Office. \n\nOklahoma: They advise voters not to take selfies, but there is no current penalty, and no history of prosecution.\n\nOregon: There are no laws prohibiting pictures of your ballot.\n\nPennsylvania: The state has sent guidance to polling places that it is within people's 1st Amendment rights to take selfies.\n\nRhode Island: Once you're in the booth, you can take pictures. No can do outside the booth.\n\nUtah: Go for it.\n\nVermont: No laws regarding selfies or photos at all.\n\nVirginia: Take a pic and make it good.\n\nWashington: It's not recommended, but you're fine.\n\nWyoming: Nothing says you can't, but don't be disruptive.\n\nBack to top", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.48257970809937, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1176, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 21, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.920967086519999, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161102190000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 2.63605442176871, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/20/us/arkansas-toddler-killing/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 508, "scraper_regex": 535}}, "headline": "Arkansas child killing: 911 tapes capture grandmother's agony", "wordcount_as_scraped": 535, "date": "20161220110000", "story_content": "The weekend shopping trip wasn't supposed to end like this.

Some were worried it could spark a major confirmation battle in the opening weeks of the Trump administration.  \n\nOne GOP senator said there is a \"a high level of angst\" among Republican senators about the political fallout if Petraeus were to be chosen.    \n\n\"I have had discussions with several of my colleagues who have expressed anxieties about this issue because, after all, this was an issue in the campaign for Hillary (Clinton) and this individual was actually convicted.

In fact, some people were alleging, it may be true I don't know, that he was closer to Clinton than he was to the Republicans. They served together in the cabinet and all that,\" McCain said. \"I haven't taken a poll or counted votes but I know how highly regarded he is.\"\n\nOne senior Republican aide noted a fight over Petraeus could be damaging for Democrats since they seemed to forgive Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of her misuse of a private email server while secretary of state.  \n\nThe top Democrat on the Intelligence committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, was asked by CNN Tuesday if Petraeus conviction was disqualifying and replied, \"I'm not going to make that judgment right now.\"\n\nShe praised the general's extensive military resume and said \"I've got to think about it.\"\n\nRELATED: Trump interviews generals for his Cabinet after criticizing them\n\nOne former Republican senator, who remains very plugged into the caucus, said GOP senators see there are obvious political problems with Petraeus and other top contenders on Trump's list, including Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney. He said the GOP senators he's talking to keep coming back to Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, as the best choice for the job.  \n\nA reflection of the GOP unease came from another former senator. Richard Lugar, of Indiana, who for years was the respected top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, was back in the Capitol Thursday for an event.  \n\nAsked by CNN if he was comfortable with Trump's short list to be secretary of state, Lugar said bluntly, \"no.\"  \n\nAsked who he was uncomfortable with, Lugar responded with a nervous laugh, \"Well, I'm not going to tell you.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.24215245246887, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 619, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.3787046261899998, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.9386106623586399, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/trump-travel-ban-congress-reaction/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1628, "scraper_regex": 1752}}, "headline": "McCain, Graham lead in GOP criticism of Trump ban, many others stay mum", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1752, "date": "20170129230000", "story_content": "Republican Sens.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017\n\nTrump also issued a statement defending the new order, saying: \"We will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do while protecting our own citizens and voters.\"\n\n\"This is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion -- this is about terror and keeping our country safe,\" he said, adding that his first priority \"will always be to protect and serve our country, but as President I will find ways to help all of those who are suffering.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York teared up at a Sunday news conference as he called the ban \"mean-spirited and un-American.\"  \n\nHe also heaped pressure on majority Republicans in the House and Senate to play a role in blocking Trump -- noting McCain's denouncement.\n\n\"We should have other Republicans speaking out against it and maybe we can pass something in the Congress,\" Schumer said. \"We can only do it with Republican support to at least undo this or stay it.\" \n\nOn Capitol Hill, many GOP offices were non-responsive in the 24 hours after the executive order was signed, though more are now making statements.\n\nThe reason, according to GOP sources in both chambers, was two-fold: They were left out of the loop by the White House before the travel ban was announced, and they see political risk coming from both directions.\n\n\"Support it and get hit, oppose it and get hit,\" one GOP source said. \"There will be time for discussion about this. Right now we'll let the administration take the lead.\"\n\nOnly a handful of lawmakers were looped in on the general content of the order, and even then, most on Capitol Hill were operating off a draft of the order that was circulating among reporters and agency sources, one aide said. \n\nCommittees with jurisdiction reached out to the relevant agencies at various point throughout the week, from the Department of Homeland Security to the Justice Department and even the White House, and were met mostly with silence or an acknowledgment that their contacts were also in the dark, several aides said.\n\nOne GOP aide noted that the House, in passing a bill to suspend the refugee program for participants in Iraq and Syria in with a veto-proof majority in 2015, had already laid down a similar marker on the issue. The order itself fell into line generally with that bill and was \"in no way a Muslim ban.\"\n\nBut even so, the confusion that appeared pervasive on the agency side extended to Capitol Hill. The status of green card holders, along those refugees already in transit, was something two GOP aides said they had been told was more clear-cut than originally perceived. \n\nThroughout the day Saturday, several senior GOP officials were still attempting to get firm answers on what precisely the exemption and waiver process would be for those programs.\n\nStill, a reality several pointed to, separately: Trump is doing what voters elected him to do.\n\n\"It's not like this was a secret during the campaign,\" one Senate aide said. \"He ran on it. He won.\"\n\nReflecting the muted reaction, Sen. Todd Young, R-Indiana, said in a statement: \"The federal government has no more important responsibility than protecting the American people, and refugees from any country should only be permitted to enter the United States if we are certain they do not represent a threat to our citizens.\"\n\n\"I am eager to ensure that the administration's new policy allows Iraqis and Afghanis who faithfully supported our troops and who face threats to their safety -- and who do not represent a terrorist threat -- to come to the United States,\" Young said. \n\nAnd at least one member offered praise --House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes.\n\n\"In light of attempts by jihadist groups to infiltrate fighters into refugee flows to the West, along with Europe's tragic experience coping with this problem, the Trump Administration's executive order on refugees is a common-sense security measure to prevent terror attacks on the homeland,\" he said in a statement. \"While accommodations should be made for green card holders and those who've assisted the US armed forces, this is a useful temporary measure on seven nations of concern until we can verify who is entering the United States.\"   \n\nGOP criticism\n\nTrump famously campaigned on a pledge to indefinitely ban Muslims from entering the United States, something his campaign aides later tried to finesse as a broader policy aimed at implementing \"extreme vetting\" for immigrants from certain countries.\n\nAnd the White House says its executive action doesn't specifically target Muslims -- instead focuses on countries that are terrorism hotbeds that also happen to be majority Muslim. But McCain and Graham said that, in effect, Trump has created the perception that he is banning Muslims from the United States. \n\n\"This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,\" the two said.\n\nMcCain and Graham aren't the only Republican senators to criticize Trump so far.\n\n\"This was an extreme vetting program that wasn't properly vetted,\" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nHe said he's glad to see two federal judges temporarily block Trump's executive order, and said Congress should be involved in strengthening the nation's vetting of visa applicants.\n\n\"We ought to be part of it. We've been working on this,\" Portman said.  \n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, said in a statement that \"while not technically a Muslim ban, this order is too broad.\" \n\n\"There are two ways to lose our generational battle against jihadism by losing touch with reality,\" he said. \"The first is to keep pretending that jihadi terrorism has no connection to Islam or to certain countries. That's been a disaster. And here's the second way to fail: If we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion.\" \n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, urged Trump's administration to tailor the executive order to be \"as narrowly as possible.\" \n\nHatch said as a Mormon, he is aware that many of his ancestors were refugees himself, as he called on Trump to reduce \"unnecessary burdens on the vast majority of visa-seekers that present a promise -- not a threat -- to our nation.\" \n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, like McCain and Graham, said Trump's executive order appears to target Muslims broadly. \n\n\"President Trump and his administration are right to be concerned about national security, but it's unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry,\" he said in a statement. \"Enhancing long term national security requires that we have a clear-eyed view of radical Islamic terrorism without ascribing radical Islamic terrorist views to all Muslims.\"\n\nRepublican leaders silent\n\nOn ABC's \"This Week,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Trump should have \"a lot of latitude\" to secure the country by improving vetting of immigrants. \n\nHe said he opposes \"religious tests,\" but did not specify whether Trump's executive order is one. \n\n\"The courts are going to determine whether this is too broad,\" McConnell said. \n\nA spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, was similarly vague -- telling The Washington Post: \"This is not a religious test and it is not a ban on people of any religion.\" \n\nDemocrats push back\n\nDemocrats from liberal havens to conservative states have equally condemned the travel ban.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, a freshman Democrat from California, wrote to the Department of Homeland Security urging that Customs and Border Protection grant those detained at airports immediate access to lawyers. \n\nCustoms agents, she wrote, should \"be directed to grant individuals detained at ports-of-entry throughout the United States timely and unfettered access to legal counsel.\"\n\nAnd two red-state Democrats up for re-election in 2018 -- North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and Montana Sen. Jon Tester -- both criticized it in statements Sunday.\n\n\"This executive order is having harmful consequences on children and brave allies who are helping us fight terrorism,\" Tester said. \"We must take strong steps to protect our nation from those who want to harm us, but we cannot sacrifice our religious freedom and our American values.\"\n\nIn a lengthy Facebook post, Heitkamp wrote that Trump's move \"confirms the lie terrorists tell their recruits: that America is waging a war on Islam. This is outrageous.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 26, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.68063426017761, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1628, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 10, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 25, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 9.753998968, "HarmVirtue": 19, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 15, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 26, "mft_sum": 103, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170129230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.32678132678133, "mft_mean": 9.36363636364}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/08/middleeast/syria-aleppo-kerry-lavrov/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 717, "scraper_regex": 880}}, "headline": "Syria stops Aleppo military action, Russian official says", "wordcount_as_scraped": 880, "date": "20161208070000", "story_content": "The Syrian army has stopped all military actions in Aleppo and is focusing efforts on evacuating residents, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Thursday. \n\n\"This is the largest ever evacuation of eastern Aleppo residents, with close to 5,000 residents being moved,\" Lavrov told reporters at the summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, in Hamburg, Germany. \n\n Lavrov's words were echoed by Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who called this the \"biggest operation for civilian evacuation.\" \n\nCNN crews on the ground in Aleppo could still hear mortar rounds going off despite the announcement. \n\nUS, Russia meet to discuss Syria\n\nLavrov's comments come one day after a meeting with US Secretary of State John Kerry  to discuss ways to end the bombing of Aleppo, allow safe passage of those who want to flee the war-torn northern Syrian city, and deliver humanitarian aid to its remaining residents. \n\nThe two met for about 45 minutes Wednesday evening in Hamburg, ahead of a two-day OSCE summit.

This is a withdrawal by opposition forces from Aleppo in the face of massive combined force of Russia, Hezbollah and the Assad government,\" Prince said. \n\n\"Other than the humanitarian benefit of evacuating civilians, the reassertion of Assad's control of Syria's most populous city will lead to more bloodshed and bolster recruitment efforts of extremists like (ISIS). \n\n\"The world needs to find a comprehensive solution in Syria that involves transition to a legitimate federal government and the withdrawal of all foreign forces.\"\n\nDesperate situation\n\nOne activist in eastern Aleppo told CNN as many as 200,000 people, including rebels and their families, were crammed into 10 rebel-held neighborhoods, some having fled from other areas under fire.\n\nHe described the situation as \"apocalyptic,\" saying the few medical facilities still operating were packed with injured civilians and resembled \"slaughterhouses,\" with no medical supplies or proper equipment.\n\nDozens of people have been killed daily in the strikes and crossfire between the regime and rebels since the Syrian forces began their push into eastern Aleppo on November 26, activist groups said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 6, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.7084398269653303, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 717, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.2599641626599998, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.48675034867503, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/opinions/us-campaign-against-isis-daniel-l-davis-opinion/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00ef": [4474]}}, "headline": "Mosul, Raqqa and the failures of the US campaigns against ISIS ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 815, "date": "20161118150000", "story_content": "This month, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook detailed the US intent to drive ISIS from the Syrian city of Raqqa. He said the removal of the ISIS \"cancer from the so-called capital of their so-called caliphate is the next step in our military campaign plan.\"\n\nThis step, a Pentagon press release noted, is \"happening as Iraqi security forces and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are gaining ground as they advance toward Mosul.\" From a tactical, strategic and political point of view, however, this tough-sounding \"campaign plan\" is built on sand and has little chance of success. It takes surprisingly little analysis to expose the reasons why. \n\nCurrently in Mosul, a cobbled-together military coalition is making slow but steady progress to retake the Iraqi city in the face of stiffening ISIS resistance. \n\nThus far, the operation has centered on stripping away the smaller villages surrounding Mosul to isolate ISIS in the city proper and set the stage for the brutal city fighting yet to come.\n\nYet before the difficult combat phase has begun in Mosul, US officials have already announced the initiation of the battle for Raqqa. Militarily speaking, expanding the fight to ISIS' Syrian stronghold before success in Mosul is unwise.\n\nThe challenges facing US-backed forces in Iraq just to retake Mosul are substantial. It appears that ISIS will not go quietly and has decided to fight to the death.\n\nMeanwhile, there is already friction between the Iraqi security forces and Shia militias, Sunni militias and other smaller fighting forces; reports of summary executions on civilians liberated from ISIS control have already surfaced, threatening to pit Shia armed troops against Sunni and Kurdish troops.\n\nTurkey remains uninvited \n\nCompounding this problem, Turkey remains an uninvited -- and unwanted -- guest on Iraqi territory with armored units. \n\nAnkara claims that it will engage with this force in Mosul if things don't go as it desires, irrespective of what Baghdad says. This makes life difficult for the United States, as most of our airstrikes on Syria originate from the Turkish air base at Incirlik.  \n\nRegardless of how complicated these factors make the already difficult fight in Mosul, the challenges involved in the battle for Raqqa are even higher, especially when it comes to Turkey. \n\nState Department spokesman Mark Toner recently explained that the United States is coordinating with Turkey on how to keep the pressure on the common enemy -- ISIS.\n\nHe said Washington had called on all sides in this conflict to focus on ISIS whether, \"it's the YPG (People's Protection Units), whether it's other Syrian, Arab or Kurdish forces, and whether it's Turkey.\"\n\nTurkey, however, doesn't appear to be interested in close cooperation with other forces.\n\nIn October, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim poured cold water on Washington's hope for unity when he announced Turkey's condition to join the Raqqa operation: \"If the YPG will be there, we won't be.\" The YPG forms the backbone of the ground troops Washington is counting on to push ISIS out of Raqqa.\n\nFollowing a hastily arranged visit to Turkey to try and salvage the situation, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at first backpedaled on US hopes. Yet how the chairman proposed to bridge the gap between the expectations of the Kurds and the Turks in fighting in a unified, cooperative way was not addressed. \n\nUS authorities seem to wish away problems\n\nIt is troubling that American authorities frequently seem to wish away hard problems, pushing ahead with military operations while hoping troubles somehow work themselves out. \n\nThis worrying proclivity was most recently exposed when Army Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, commander of Combined Joint Task Force Inherent Resolve, explained that throughout the battle for Raqqa, the United States would \"continually consult with allies and partners as we plan for the city's ultimate seizure and governance once ISIS is defeated.\"\n\nIt is astounding that the general admitted that fighting was underway and yet there was still no agreement as to who would provide security and governance post-ISIS.\n\nWithout this most basic agreement, there is the potential that even after ISIS is defeated, the victors might then turn on each other in an attempt to control the city. Using unsubstantiated hope as a basis for conducting foreign policy is a dangerous and na\u00efve plan.\n\nFrom a strategic perspective, it is an outright gamble, on both the diplomatic and military fronts for Washington to support operations in both Mosul and Raqqa simultaneously. The security situation in Syria and Iraq are in large measure in dire straits because of unsuitable tactical decisions taken by the United States and the West with little to no consideration of how or whether those actions would contribute to an attainable strategic objective.\n\nUntil such focus is found, it is likely that those two war-torn areas will continue struggling in cycles of violence and the United States will continue to fail to accomplish critical national security objectives.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.2857141494751, "HarmVice": 10, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 787, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.34465568922, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161118150000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.4472681067344295, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/donald-trump-immigration-detention-deportations-enforcement/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1219, "scraper_regex": 1288}}, "headline": "Trump's executive orders dramatically expand power of immigration officers", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1288, "date": "20170128150000", "story_content": "The immigration executive orders signed by President Donald Trump this week could amount to a vast expansion of authority for individual immigration officers and a dramatic increase in efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. \n\nThe order lays out a series of categories of undocumented immigrants that immigration law enforcement officials should prioritize for removing from the country, a reaction to what was criticized by the right as lax enforcement of immigration law by former President Barack Obama. \n\nBut experts say the descriptions include virtually every person in the country illegally and give broad latitude to individual immigration officers to decide who should be detained for deportation.\n\nIn addition to a strain on resources, critics worry the orders could cause legal concerns.\n\nThe Obama administration had prioritized expulsion of undocumented immigrants who threatened public safety or national security, had ties to criminal gang activity, committed serious felony offenses or were habitual misdemeanor criminal offenders. \n\nTrump's order goes far beyond that, using a sweeping definition of \"criminal\" and giving a single immigration officer the ability to make judgments on threats to public safety. \n\nTrump says US will prioritize Christian refugees\n\nThe order says the priority will be removing deportable immigrants who \"have been convicted of any criminal offense; have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved; have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or in the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.\"\n\nThe order labels each category \"A\" through \"G,\" but doesn't make explicit whether they are in decreasing order of significance or equal. \n\nExperts say the order would seemingly include all undocumented immigrants -- a departure from Obama administration policies that extended some protections to those that have lived in the US for potentially decades and have otherwise been contributing members of society. The Obama administration offered formal protection to a group under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, geared toward undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children who grew up here and were pursuing education or jobs.  \n\nTrump has said that such individuals are not his priority, that he wants to focus on removing \"bad dudes.\" Nevertheless, his sweeping executive order would seemingly allow for anyone to be detained for removal proceedings, even if they have only been suspected of committing a crime, including misdemeanors, or of being a threat.\n\n\"I think it covers just about every illegal alien in the country,\" said Hans von Spakovsky, a legal expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has been strongly influential on Trump's policy. \"It's also very clear that the No. 1 priority is people who have been charged and convicted with criminal offenses, and that's the kind of violent criminals who should be out of the country.\"\n\nStill, there's nothing in the current order that makes that clear. It places a violent criminal at the same level as a parent of US citizen children who works and contributes to their community, said Washington University law professor Stephen Legomsky.\n\n\"That strikes me as crazy,\" said Legomsky, who has served as a consultant to Obama, former President Bill Clinton and the George H.W. Bush administration. \n\nResources strained\n\nLegomsky and other experts believe the order places tremendous authority on individual ICE agents and divisions. \n\nThe union that represents ICE agents endorsed Trump during the campaign, offering harsh criticism of Obama's enforcement priorities. Under the past administration, officers were \"unable to arrest or are forced to release many of the most dangerous (criminals) back into U.S. communities due to unscrupulous political agendas and corrupt leaders,\" National ICE Council President Chris Crane said in a statement about the endorsement. \n\nThe new enforcement priorities, and the additional 10,000 immigration officers prescribed by the orders, are presumably designed to give ICE what it wants -- more authority.  \n\nBut a former acting ICE director under Obama says that the new enforcement priorities risk overwhelming an already stressed system and makes it more difficult for individual officers.\n\nMark Zuckerberg criticizes Trump on immigration\n\n\"The language here, the fact that it says 'in the judgment of an immigration officer,' that doesn't suggest there's going to be supervisory review, it strongly suggests this is going to be the judgment of officers in the field and they'll have broad discretion about when and where to arrest someone and bring proceedings,\" said John Sandweg, now at a crisis management firm. \n\nSandweg said ICE data shows that only a few hundred thousand individuals can be removed per year, and that immigration judges and detention facilities are already overwhelmed by cases. He said that was why the Obama administration set limited priorities and specified types of criminals to target. \n\n\"I think the idea of saying there's a limited number of people can be deported in a given year, let's make sure that they're the most violent and most dangerous, that makes sense,\" he said, \"and this seems to be a reversal of that policy and I think endangers public safety as a result.\"\n\nWhile Trump's orders call for an increase in detention facilities and judges to be assigned to those facilities, it will be up to Congress to determine how much resources go to implementing these measures. \n\nLegal concerns\n\nCritics of the order are also concerned about the legal implications of not just targeting convicted criminals, but including anyone even suspected of crimes. \n\nHeidi Altman, director of policy at the pro-immigrant National Immigrant Justice Center, said the order would allow \"immigration officials to target undocumented people on the basis of their whims in that moment.\"\n\nShe argues that's problematic because it contradicts principles of the criminal justice system, including the presumption of innocence. \n\nWashington Muslims put human faces to Trump immigration actions\n\n\"An ICE officer is now making the determination to detain and deport someone that no one has adjudicated for veracity,\" Altman said. \"Innocent people get arrested in the United States a lot. ... Especially among communities of color, there are always going to be instances of racial profiling, and minorities face more aggressive policing than white communities -- that's true as well for immigrant communities. This (order) renders presumption of innocence completely meaningless.\"\n\nLegomsky and Cornell law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr said the enforcement provisions likely couldn't be challenged in court simply for how they are written, as undocumented immigrants are eligible to be detained and deported under the law.\n\nBut if the implementation of the law results in racial profiling, for example, critics could have grounds to challenge. \n\n\"I think most of the concerns are policy concerns rather than legal concerns, but if more racial profiling materially increases as a result of this, then yes there could be serious equal protection and even Fourth Amendment -- unreasonable search and seizure -- type of concerns,\" Legomsky said. \"That is speculative though, that really depends on how these orders are implemented.\"\n\nUltimately, von Spakovsky says that activists who fear the persecution of contributing members of society for being undocumented are ignoring the fact that illegal immigration is against the law. \n\n\"I see nothing wrong with deporting individuals who are in the country illegally, and I say that as a son of immigrants,\" he said. \"But my parents followed the rules to come into the country and I, like a lot of Americans, resent people who think they can break the rules and stay in the country and get ahead of people who follow the rules that we set up.\" ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 1, "tone": -7.6687116622924805, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1219, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 35, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 9, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 10.751897776, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 27, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 5, "mft_max": 35, "mft_sum": 108, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170128150000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 8.8597210828548, "mft_mean": 9.818181818180001}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/opinions/why-do-americans-hate-hillary-rogan-opinion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Why do so many Americans hate Hillary Clinton?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 933, "date": "20161104110000", "story_content": "As an American who grew up in part overseas, I am well aware of the fact that citizens of other nations often find US politics to be, well, very strange. That's never been truer than in this election.\n\n\"After all\", many foreigners ask, \"how could Americans even consider choosing a blustering billionaire over an experienced former senator and secretary of state?\"\n\nThe answer is fourfold: anger, economics, cronyism, and identity politics\n\nAmerica is angry\n\nFirst off, Americans are exceptionally angry with their political establishment. As a definitive Washington DC insider and Donald Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton was always a natural target for this anger. \n\nBut the anger has a foundation. Many Americans view President Obama and members of Congress as having failed to deliver on their promises of a better nation.\n\nRepublican voters lament increasing spending and a ballooning national debt. Democratic voters lament Obama's inability to get more laws through Congress. Independent voters (those not aligned with either party) lament the relentless partisan bickering. \n\nAs a once-in-a-generation political outsider, Trump has been able to capitalize on this discontent. Yes, the vast majority of his supporters are Republicans. But many others -- in swing states like Florida and Ohio -- are independents. Some even are Democrats.\n\nTrump's core success here has been his usurpation of amorphous anger into his political identity. Becoming the candidate of the angry disenchanted, Trump has made Clinton the candidate of the status quo.\n\nThe second issue that hurts Clinton and helps Trump is the economy. \n\nWhile the recession is over and unemployment rates have fallen, a lot of Americans don't feel it. Their doubt is supported by an increasingly weak employment participation rate and record numbers of Americans stuck in part-time work. Whatever one thinks of his policies or personality, Trump has capitalized on this economic doubt. \n\nUsing the decline in US manufacturing jobs as a metaphor for all economic doubts, Trump blames China and free trade and ignores technological changes. Though disingenuous, this populism -- delivered with anger and charisma -- is Trump's Excalibur. And he wields it by weaponizing these doubts against his opponent. \n\nTrump claims he'll bring back hundreds of thousands of jobs. Then, in the next sentence, he attacks Clinton as a globalist beholden to global liberalism, rather than American workers. Trump used this strategy to good effect in the debates.\n\nTrump's charisma must not be underestimated when it comes to the economy. While many Americans view him as a vile narcissist, his offering of easy choices and confident leadership is tempting. I once lamented, on \"The McLaughlin Group\" TV show, Trump's refusal to consider entitlement reform. As a conservative, I believe this is the key issue facing the US today. \n\nMy fellow conservative and Trump supporter on the panel, Pat Buchanan, offered a sharp rebuke. \"Let me tell you what would be a joke,\" he said, \"walking out there and saying we're going to cut Medicare!\"\n\nIn campaign terms, Pat was right. In the same way, Trump's economic message is one people want to hear, and avoids that which they don't. It works. \n\nClinton Fatigue\n\nNext up, there's Clinton Inc. Whether it's the email saga, or Clinton's pay-to-play tenure at the State Department (seats on commissions appear to have been given in return for donations to the Clinton Foundation), or her big-buck speeches on Wall Street, Hillary Clinton does not have a reputation for honesty. \n\nOn the contrary, in many ways Clinton is a made-for Trump caricature of Washington DC cronyism. This record -- and Clinton's persistent refusal to show regret for it -- has helped Trump shape an unusual narrative for the electorate: You not might like his gauche rhetoric, but at least he owns it. Clinton, however, is simply a liar.\n\nStill, perhaps the most important issue against Clinton and in Trump's favor is identity politics. Whether it be his proposed ban on Muslims, or his promise to build a wall on the Mexican border, or his bombastic (if undefined) threats to annihilate ISIS, Trump persuades voters that he will protect them. \n\nUS society is growing more diverse and the world is growing more dangerous. For Americans focused primarily on paying the bills, Trump's rhetoric against foreigners who either steal jobs or threaten lives strikes a nerve. \n\nObama is partly to blame here. His failed foreign policy and his flippant attitude to immigration law have angered many voters and discredited former Cabinet member Clinton.\n\nThat said, Clinton has herself to blame for much of Trump's success. Take free trade. Trump's anti-free trade sentiment has put him in pole position in the key swing state of Ohio. Instead of explaining how free trade saves hundreds of millions of Americans thousands of dollars annually, Clinton has flip-flopped. She used to be for free trade but today she is in a no man's land between free trade and anti-trade. It's a perfect error: No one believes Clinton is anything other than free trade, and so she's ceded the debate to Trump. Clinton's only rebuke here? Complaining that Trump makes his ties in China. \n\nTrump, in turn, says that this is good business sense and that he'll do things differently when his priorities change as president. His supporters cheer, and Democrats and Independents give him the benefit of the doubt. It's a metaphor for the 2016 campaign: Trump's fakeness veiled in populist charisma against Clinton's never-ending political calculations.\n\nNevertheless, don't take this article as a prediction of an impending Trump victory. He has upset many Republicans, most notably via his comments on women and fallen service personnel. But he may win.

These ghost children are easy prey for traffickers.\"\n\n\"It's an African problem which nobody is interested in,\" he adds. \n\nIn Burkina Faso, proof of the birth must be supplied on the day the baby is born, and being able to register the child remotely for those living in rural areas will help get more people registered, according to the company.\n\nHow iCivil works\n\nThe system creates a digital birth certificate using iCivil's Android mobile application and a bracelet with a unique code, called a Prooftag Bubble Seal, a patented technology produced by co-founder Francis Bourrieres' company Prooftag, based in Toulouse, France.\n\nOnce the bracelet is put on the baby, a midwife scans the code using the app and enters the newborn's details on the mobile interface. This is automatically sent in an encoded text message via iCivil's platform to the civil registration authorities.\n\nThe baby is then registered in the system, and a birth certificate containing the ID code can be printed and collected from any civil registration center in the country upon presenting the bracelet.\n\nThe same technology has previously been used as fraud prevention in French wines and is based on a unique identifier generated through a so-called 'bubble code'. \n\n1,500 newborns were registered on the first trial using the system at 10 different health centers in Burkina Faso's capital city of  Ouagadougou between August 2015 and July 2016. \n\nChildren without an identity\n\nWhile it is still early days for iCivil, their efforts draw attention to a wider problem.\n\nIn Burkina Faso, which has a population of nearly 17 million, 3 million children were unregistered at the latest census in 2006, with the majority living in rural areas.\n\nThe consequences may range from vulnerability to traffickers to difficulties attending school and obtaining a passport.\n\nWith the increase in migration in Africa, these issues are likely to get worse, says Edward Duffus, Head of Birth Registration Innovation at Plan International.\n\n\"When not registered they have an increased chance of becoming stateless, which is clearly a big problem for refugees.\" \n\nOther tools being tested\n\nWhile iCivil's approach may be unique, their system is not the only digital tool currently being tested in Africa, according to Duffus.\n\nSome are run by nonprofit organizations such as Plan International, which has a pilot program in Kenya that includes a mobile application. \n\nThere are some caveats to consider in the design of these tools, however, such as tailoring them to a specific country's needs, Duffus says.\n\nSome areas are still working to raise awareness among parents of the importance of registering a child, for example, and so the demand for these tools may not be very high in some areas yet.\n\n\"Getting your child registered for birth is often not high on the list of parents' priorities when living in poverty, a long way from the registration center, \" Duffus says.\n\nBig future plans\n\nWith the first trial completed, iCivil are now in talks with Burkina Faso's government about implementing the system nationwide at a cost of $20 million, which would include producing around 800,000 bracelets a year, Sawadogo says.\n\n\"The government is discussing the project with financial partners like UNICEF and the World Health Organization to get the money to put it in all regions of Burkina Faso.\"\n\nThey hope more countries will soon follow.\n\n\"We want to build this project across the continent.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1,

"20170128160000", "story_content": "President Donald Trump's hints about easing sanctions on Russia have been met with a clear European response -- please don't. \n\nOn Saturday, Trump is set to hold his first official phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after a senior aide said Trump is considering lifting penalties put in place after Russia's intervention in eastern Ukraine and annexation of Crimea. \n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, visiting Washington Friday, made clear the UK's position -- sanctions should remain until Russia and the Ukrainian rebels it backs meet the requirements of a 2014 agreement to end hostilities. \n\nIf the US moves forward on sanctions without the backing of allies like the UK, Trump risks seriously straining ties with some of its oldest and most reliable allies, European countries are already unsettled by the President's stated desire to get closer to Russia and his suggestions that NATO is \"obsolete.\" \n\nUnilaterally easing Russia sanctions \"would be another blow to US-EU relations,\" said Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University. \"If sanctions are removed unilaterally it removes a major basis for trust between the two allies.\"\n\nThe Obama administration worked very closely to get the reluctant Europeans to impose sanctions, Stent recalled, only getting European buy-in after a Malaysian Airlines flight traveling from Holland to Malaysia was downed by a Russian-made missile. \n\nWhat's more, she adds, \"if the sanctions are lifted in the absence of agreement from our European allies and in the absence of the Russians fulfilling what they're supposed to do with regards to Minsk\" -- the 2014 agreement to end the conflict -- \"the Russians have gotten away with what they've done in Ukraine.\"\n\nTrump was at his first White House press conference with a foreign leader Friday when he was asked about the possibility of removing penalties on Russia. Standing beside May, a bust of the British wartime leader Winston Churchill between them, Trump walked a careful line.  \n\n\"As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that,\" he said. \"We look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally. That won't necessarily happen, unfortunately probably won't happen with many countries.\"\n\nOn Friday night, just hours ahead of Trump's call with Putin, a senior administration official said the current plan of the White House is not to ease sanctions. \n\nMay, who had spent the previous two days emphasizing UK solidarity with the new American administration, and had publicly warned about trusting Putin, was definitive about her position. \n\n\"As far as the UK is concerned, on sanctions for Russia in relation to their activities in the Ukraine, we have been very clear that we want to see the Minsk Agreement fully implemented,\" she said. \"We've been continuing to argue that inside the European Union.\"\n\nWhile Britain has chosen to leave the EU, diplomats said there's no daylight between the UK and the 27 countries remaining in the European bloc when it comes to Russia sanctions. \n\nEuropean diplomats told CNN that any decision the organization makes will be determined by EU interests -- and not political decisions by Trump in Washington. \n\nTrump spoke of his desire for closer relations with Russia throughout the campaign, touting it as a plus if Moscow and the US could cooperate to defeat ISIS. Trump's desire for better relations with Putin became a fraught issue, as US intelligence agencies charged that Moscow had directed cyberattacks tied to the 2016 election with the aim of helping Trump. \n\nEarlier Friday, top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News that lifting US sanctions on Russia would be up for discussion when Trump and Putin speak Saturday. \n\n\"All of that is under consideration,\" Conway said when asked specifically whether lifting sanctions approved by the Obama administration would be considered.\n\nTrump had hedged in his White House remarks, saying, \"I hear a call was set up and we will see what happens.\"\n\n\"I hope we have a fantastic relationship,\" he said of Putin. \"That's possible, and it's also possible that we won't. We will see what happens.\" \n\nAfter an initial attempt to improve relations with Russia, the Obama administration hit Russian banks, individuals, energy companies and defense contractors with sanctions in 2014 for their support for Ukrainian separatists. After Russia's annexation of Crimea, the US punished Russian individuals with asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nAnd after intelligence agencies reached their conclusion about Russian interference in the election, the Obama administration expelled 35 Russian diplomats.\n\nDerek Chollet, a senior adviser for defense and security policy at the German Marshall Fund, said it's not clear Trump will actually follow through on easing sanctions.\n\n\"This could be yet another idea that they've floated that they end up not doing,\" he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.89505434036255, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 780, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.38452309975, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170128160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.92307692307692, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/politics/takeaways-donald-trump-new-york-times-meeting/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1054, "scraper_regex": 1132}}, "headline": "6 takeaways from Donald Trump's New York Times meeting", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1132, "date": "20161122220000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump brushed aside his campaign promises to jail Hillary Clinton, batted away questions about conflicts of interest over his business empire and denounced the neo-Nazi movement that is celebrating his victory. \n\nAnswering questions for just the second time since his election, Trump met for 75 minutes on Tuesday with reporters, editors and columnists from The New York Times. \n\nIt wasn't broadcast live, but some Times reporters tweeted Trump's remarks in real time. And, since Trump has not held a news conference since his upset win two weeks ago, the entire political world was glued to Twitter through it all. \n\nHere are six takeaways from Trump's meeting with the Times: \n\nThe grudges Trump is still holding\n\nThe President-elect was downright magnanimous toward his longtime Democratic foes. \n\nAbout his campaign promise to jail Hillary Clinton, Trump said he doesn't want to \"hurt the Clintons\" and that doing so would be \"very, very divisive for the country.\"  \n\nHe heaped praise on President Barack Obama, saying he appreciated Obama's handling of the transition of power and liked him personally. \"I didn't know if I'd like him. I probably thought that maybe I wouldn't, but I did. I really enjoyed him a lot,\" Trump said. \n\nAnd of New York's Chuck Schumer, the new Senate Democratic leader: \"I've liked Chuck Schumer for a long time.\"\n\nSo it's not the opposition that still gets under Trump's skin. \n\nIt's his fellow Republicans -- particularly those who ran away from him in the general election.\n\nTrump bragged that he \"helped numerous senators\" win, and took a shot New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican who narrowly lost after distancing herself from Trump. \"No, thank you,\" he said he told Ayotte about a post in Trump's Cabinet. \n\nHe also mocked Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, a Republican who lost his Senate race after similarly staying far away from Trump. Heck, he said, fell \"like a lead balloon.\"\n\nTrump was also cautious about the Republican congressional leaders -- House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \n\n\"Right now they're in love with me,\" Trump said. \"Four weeks ago, they weren't in love with me.\" \n\nA Nixonian conflict-of-interest view\n\nTrump brushed aside questions about how his actions in the White House could benefit his businesses with a startling declaration. \n\n\"The law's totally on my side. The president can't have a conflict of interest,\" Trump said. \n\nIt was reminiscent of Richard Nixon's comment to journalist David Frost that by definition, a president's actions don't violate the law. \"Well, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal,\" Nixon said. \n\nTrump acknowledged his businesses will benefit from his victory, saying his new hotel in Washington is \"probably a more valuable asset than it was before\" and that its brand is \"hotter.\" \n\nBut he said he's no longer interested in his businesses and will be passing them on to his children. \n\n\"I don't care about having anything to do\" with anything outside the United States' best interests, he said. \"I don't want to influence anything.\"\n\nA new view on climate change?\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump had pledged to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords -- a move that would upend global efforts to address global warming. \n\nTuesday, he wasn't as specific.\n\n\"I'm looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it,\" he said. \n\nIt was part of a broader change for the President-elect on the topic of climate science. He had previously rejected scientists' conclusion that humans have played a role in the earth's warming. But on Tuesday, Trump said that \"I think there is some connectivity\" between humans and climate change, although he declined to elaborate.\n\nTrump's white supremacist disavowal\n\nDays after the white supremacist movement, known as the \"alt-right,\" gathered in Washington to celebrate Trump's victory, the President-elect said he wants nothing to do with them. \n\n\"I don't want to energize the group, and I disavow the group,\" he told the Times. \"It's not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why.\"\n\nAlso notable is what Trump didn't do: He didn't condemn the white supremacist groups like the National Policy Institute, which led the weekend gathering, by name -- something that's noticed every time Trump personally takes the time to slam the cast of \"Hamilton\" or wade into other feuds on his Twitter account. \n\nTrump also took flak recently after he tapped his campaign CEO Steve Bannon to be one of his top two advisers in the White House. Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, touted the website as \"the platform for the alt-right.\" Bannon rejected the anti-Semitic and racist elements of the alt-right in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week and declared himself an \"economic nationalist.\"\n\nTrump defended Bannon in his New York Times meeting, saying that he's known him for \"a long time\" and that the allegations of anti-Semitism and connections to the alt-right are \"not him.\"\n\n\"If I thought he was racist, or 'alt-right' ... I wouldn't even think about hiring him,\" Trump said Tuesday.\n\nKushner the peace-maker? \n\nTrump laid out some lofty foreign policy ambitions. \n\n\"I would love to be the one who made peace with Israel and the Palestinians. That would be such a great achievement,\" he said, referring to a conflict that has vexed presidents for decades. \n\nHow is Trump going to do that? \n\nIt's not clear -- and Trump showed just how limited his foreign policy knowledge is when he suggested his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, could help make peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. \n\nTrump's approach to foreign policy remains an open question. He did tell the Times, \"I don't think we should be a nation-builder\" -- an implicit shot at the American military's role in the Iraq War.\n\nHe also said \"we have to end that craziness that's going on in Syria,\" adding that he has a \"different view than everybody else\" of that conflict -- without explaining that view.\n\nWhat an age we live in\n\nTrump hasn't held a news conference in the 14 days since he won the election -- the longest period of silence from a president-elect in decades. \n\nSo when he met with The New York Times, the entire political world was watching. But not on screen -- the meeting wasn't live-streamed or televised. \n\nInstead, the news came 140 characters at a time from the Twitter accounts of Times reporters like Maggie Haberman, Mike Grynbaum and Julie Davis, who were posting the President-elect's remarks live. \n\nThose tweets were being shown on-screen as cable news networks covered the developments, with no audio and no video of Trump -- just tweets containing his remarks.

The sources say there is some new information but would not specify due to the classified nature of the intelligence.  \n\nDespite the Democratic pressure, the sources say that they do not see the new information as significantly changing the intelligence agencies' understanding of what Russia was intending to do since the targets of the hack were known to be the democratic party. \n\nThere is no indication the intelligence community is planning to update its October 7 public statement from the Director of National Intelligence that laid out publicly the US intelligence community's view regarding Russian cyber activities.\n\nThe reality behind Russia's fake news\n\nIn that statement, intelligence community blamed Russia for the hacks and said the \"thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process.\"\n\nHowever, the intelligence community has never publicly said that Russia's intention was to help Donald Trump over his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe call to release the information came in a short letter to the president released by seven Democratic senators that said \"there is additional information concerning the Russian Government and the U.S. election\" and called for the details to be declassified and released to the public. The public letter was signed by all the Democrats on the Senate intelligence community except the ranking member, Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Feinstein did sign the second, classified message sent conveying more information about the request.\n\nA Trump ally dismissed the new push by the Democratic Party.\n\n\"This is nothing more than sour grapes from partisan Democrats upset that Hillary Clinton lost.\"\n\n\"I don't consider this a partisan issue,\" said Sen. Angus King, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who signed the letter. \"We can't just let it go and say that's history because they will keep doing it.\" \n\nPutin: Trump agrees US-Russia relations 'must be straightened out'\n\nAt a hearing last month, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper did not address why the Russians interfered but did say he saw no reason Russian efforts would stop now that Donald Trump has been elected.\n\n\"I don't anticipate a significant change in Russian behavior, Clapper said in the November 17th hearing. \"Russians have a very active and aggressive capability to conduct information operations, so called hybrid warfare. That's been a long standing practice of theirs going back to the Soviet era and I anticipate that it will continue.\"\n\nDuring the election, Democrats have been frustrated that the intelligence community did not go as far as to say the meddling was intended to benefit Donald Trump, noting all of the hacking was directed at Democratic operatives -- the Democratic National Committee and top Hillary Clinton campaign official John Podesta. Emails from those intrusions were posted online.\n\n\"The Russians were not seeking alone to sow discord into our democratic process by their hacking and dumping prior to the election; they were also seeking to damage Secretary Clinton, and in so doing, assist their preferred candidate, Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, a democrat on the House intelligence committee. \"To  conclude otherwise, you would have to be oblivious to the one-sided nature of their release of damaging internal emails, or consider the Russians unmindful of what they were doing.\"\n\nRussia's president called the US accusations \"myths\" in his address to Russia's parliament on Thursday. \n\nDonald Trump's first 100 days: A breakdown of his plan\n\nOn Friday Republican lawmakers downplayed the letter, telling CNN there was no new information to suggest the intelligence community has changed its assessment in any way. One senior Republican who is on the intelligence committee and sits in on classified briefings for Congress said there is not information to advance the narrative regarding why Russia interfered. \n\nRep.

Jerry Brown signed California's law in 2015, he said: \"I do not know what I would do if I were dying in prolonged and excruciating pain\" and that it would be a \"comfort to consider the options afforded by this bill.\"\n\nYet the latest research shows that terminally ill patients who seek out aid-in-dying aren't primarily concerned about pain. Those who've actually used these laws thus far have been far more concerned about controlling the way they exit the world than controlling pain.\n\nThe research suggests that patients' motivations are more complicated than they're often portrayed and could affect or shape how people vote on the issue in other cities and states.\n\nColorado voters will decide on a ballot initiative to legalize physician aid-in-dying in November. The city council in Washington, D.C., voted to legalize the practice this month, though a final vote must still be held.\n\n\"It's almost never about pain,\" said Lonny Shavelson, a Berkeley, Calif., physician who specializes in the care of the terminally ill and who began writing prescriptions for lethal doses of medication in June, when California's law took effect. \"It's about dignity and control.\"\n\nPain ranks near the bottom of a list of patients' concerns in Oregon (PDF) and Washington (PDF), the first two states to legalize physician-assisted dying, which provide the most complete details about people's motivations. Only 25 percent of the 991 Oregon patients who died after taking lethal prescriptions from 1998 to 2015 were concerned about pain or had inadequate pain control, according to reports filed with the state by their doctors. In Washington, 36 percent of 917 who died were concerned about pain.\n\nIn contrast, at least 90 percent of patients in both states were motivated by a loss of autonomy, state records show. Forty-one percent of patients in Oregon and 53 percent in Washington said they feared burdening the people they loved. Montana, Vermont and California also permit aid-in-dying, but haven't released detailed information about patients' motivations.\n\nSeeking Control\n\nCompassion & Choices, an advocacy group that supports aid-in-dying, focuses heavily on the need to relieve dying patients of pain.\n\nOne of the group's new ads promotes the District of Columbia's Death With Dignity Act as giving \"a dying person the option to avoid the worst pain and suffering at the end of life.\" The widower of Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old California woman who became the best-known advocate for the right to die, has spoken publicly in support of the legislation. Maynard, who had an aggressive brain tumor, moved to Oregon in 2014 in order to use that state's aid-in-dying law. She died that year after using a lethal prescription.\n\n\"The dying process is what Brittany feared,\" said her husband, Dan Diaz. \"She was afraid that her final few days on this green earth would be ones where she was tortured by the tumor.\"\n\nMary Klein, a 68-year-old resident of the District who is fighting advanced ovarian cancer, said she wants choices at the end of her life.\n\n\"I want to have the option to control my own body and control my own life,\" said Klein, a retired journalist and artist who appears in a video supporting legislation to legalize aid-in-dying in the city, created by Compassion & Choices.\n\nAlthough Klein says she may also enroll in hospice care, which focuses on the needs of people with six months or less to live, she wants to have an alternative if the services don't meet her needs.\n\n\"The dominant reasons for wanting euthanasia or assisted suicide are psychological and involve control factors,\" said Ezekiel Emanuel, chair of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He noted that most of those who've used aid-in-dying laws are white, well-insured and college educated. \"These are people who are used to controlling every aspect of their lives, and they want to control this aspect of their lives.\"\n\nA study of 56 Oregon patients interested in physician aid-in-dying reached similar conclusions. Although patients were concerned about the risk of future pain, they ranked \"current pain\" as unimportant, according to the 2009 study in Archives of Internal Medicine (now known as JAMA Internal Medicine). Patients told researchers they were primarily motivated by a desire to \"control the circumstances of death and die at home,\" as well as a loss of independence, poor quality of life and their inability to care for themselves.\n\nThe patients interviewed \"look forward to this period in their terminal illness, this time in which they will be not in control, when they will be dependent on others, when they will have a bunch of physical symptoms that will undermine their quality of life, and they want to avoid that,\" said Linda Ganzini, a professor of psychiatry and medicine at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\nCritics of aid-in-dying laws have for years warned that they could set the country on a \"slippery slope,\" in which lethal prescriptions are dispensed not just to the terminally ill, but to anyone with a disease that harms their quality of life. Those fears haven't come to pass. But physician Ira Byock, who specializes in palliative care, said aid-in-dying laws are creating a slope of another kind. Instead of helping only terminally ill patients in physical pain, they're being used by patients in psychological distress.\n\n\"It's a bait and switch,\" said Byock, executive director and chief medical officer for the Institute for Human Caring of Providence Health and Services, based in Torrance, Calif. \"We're actually helping people hasten their deaths because of existential suffering. That's chilling to me.\"\n\nAlthough right-to-die campaigns suggest that excruciating pain is often unavoidable, Byock said that \"we can relieve the suffering of almost everyone that we care for if we have the time to prepare.\"\n\nHospice staff are on call 24 hours a day to help patients in pain, Byock said. Palliative care and hospice teams also can train family caregivers how to administer emergency pain medications that take effect before nurses can arrive.\n\nHospice may have alleviated some patients' concerns, said physician Thomas Smith, director of palliative medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. Just 64 percent of Oregon patients and 82 percent of Washington patients last year actually used the lethal medications they were prescribed. Others died without taking them.\n\n\"Many people who have the prescriptions don't use them,\" Smith said. \"That suggests to me that some people find meaning and purpose and adequate symptom control, not just that they are too weak to take the pills.\"\n\nMany Kinds Of Suffering\n\nBarbara Coombs Lee, president of Compassion & Choices, said it's difficult for people to predict how they will feel as they face a deadly illness. While a healthy person might not imagine being able to tolerate physical disability, people facing the prospect of an early death are often willing to accept harsh treatments or a reduced quality of life in exchange for more time.\n\nThat change in perspective could help explain why some of those who advocate for the right to die, including those who obtain lethal prescriptions, never actually choose to hasten their death, Coombs Lee said. But she said that having the prescription on hand can ease patients' anxiety and give them peace of mind, because they can control the timing and method of death.\n\nCoombs Lee also notes that people can suffer in many ways beyond physical pain. Maynard's brain tumor caused her to suffer frequent seizures, for example. Coombs Lee also described the case of a dying woman who took a lethal prescription after she began leaking fecal matter, which prevented her from ever feeling clean.\n\nCoombs Lee quotes the woman, Penny Schleuter, in her book, \"Compassion in Dying: Stories of Dignity and Choice.\" Schleuter said the pain from her cancer could be controlled. But, she added, \"I like doing things for myself, and the idea of having somebody take care of me like I am a little 2-month-old baby is just absolutely repulsive. It's more painful than any of the pain from the cancer.\"\n\nCoombs Lee said, \"everyone who is terminally ill has some kind of nightmare that would be worse than death to them. They want to achieve sufficient control to avoid that nightmare for their family.\"\n\nDan Diaz said people shouldn't underestimate how devastating it can be to lose one's autonomy.\n\n\"If I find myself in a situation where I can't go to the bathroom on my own, where someone has to change my diapers, where I can't feed myself, where I can't care for the people around me, where other people have to move me around to keep me from having bed sores, I would then submit, is that really living?\" Diaz asked.\n\nSome people who pursue physician-assisted death \"don't want to be in a hospital, don't want to be connected to tubes,\" Coombs Lee said. \"They say, 'I want to be at home with those I love. I don't want to be delirious or unconscious at the end of life.' Those are all things that play into their fears about what their disease might descend into.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.63535213470459, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1486, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 20, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.57568775274, "HarmVirtue": 14, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 57, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161108120000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 5.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.8358008075370096, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/asia/trump-taiwan-shaun-rein/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 738, "scraper_regex": 804}}, "headline": " Opinion: Donald Trump's 'brilliant' move on Taiwan may make Asia safer", "wordcount_as_scraped": 804, "date": "20161205110000", "story_content": "Shaun Rein is the founder of the China Market Research Group (CMR) and author of \"The End of Cheap China\" and \"The End of Copycat China.\" The views expressed here are his own.\n\nDonald Trump's call with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen upended 40 years of US foreign policy. Ever since 1979, America has acknowledged a One-China policy and terminated formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. \n\nNo American president, cautious of provoking China, has spoken with the island's president since then. \n\nEven President Ronald Reagan, stalwart defender of democracy and opponent of communism, refused to cross any red line by speaking with the president of Taiwan. \n\nConcerns by foreign policy experts are that the call indicates Trump is a bumbling, rank amateur when it comes to foreign policy, who hasn't consulted with the State Department prior to calls with foreign leaders, and will hurt American prestige at best, or, at worst, is a loose cannon that is leading America to war with China.\n\nIn response to critics of his call, Trump has forcefully and quickly pushed back, with a series of tweets Sunday singling out China's currency policy and military posturing in the South China Sea.  \n\nBrilliant move with little downside\n\nThe reality is that Trump's move to speak on the phone with President Tsai is brilliant and has little downside. \n\nWith a simple 10-minute phone call, rather than selling billions of arms to Taiwan, Trump shows American strength in the Asia-Pacific region and may well actually making the region safer. \n\nUnlike President Barack Obama and his Asia pivot policy,  which the Chinese have generally ignored -- as evidenced by their continued reclamation of land in the South China Sea -- they are now going to pause and rethink all of their strategies to take Trump seriously. \n\nNothing is more sacred to Beijing than one-party rule and sovereignty over land and ocean that China considers its own. Everything else is open to negotiation. \n\nTrump has not said that he doesn't acknowledge the One-China policy, nor is he the actual president yet. \n\nBy having a call now before he is sworn in, he will have additional leverage to negotiate with China on more core American interests than the matter of Taiwan - for instance, open shipping lanes in the South China Sea, reduced cybersecurity risks emanating from China, and less protectionism and unfair competition for American business interests in China.\n\nPaper tiger?\n\nChina's muted response to the phone call shows Trump's strategy. \n\nInstead of launching military maneuvers as many American foreign policy experts feared, the Chinese Foreign Ministry simply lodged a complaint with the US. \n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the US must not disrupt \"the One-China policy [which] is the cornerstone of a healthy China-US relationship.\"\n\nMany China watchers thought China would react militarily. But China does not want to risk war. \n\nIn many ways China is like a paper tiger. \n\nIt is very good at bullying and shouting to get what it wants and to see how far it can push other nations, but it is not likely to risk a full-out war at this stage. \n\nIt will react militarily only if forced -- such as if Trump actually stops acknowledging the One-China policy.\n\nChinese state media downplayed the call and said that Trump is not yet president. Instead, state media unleashed their fury on President Tsai, whom they argue is intentionally trying to create war.\n\nRather than launching serious military exercises aimed at America, it is more likely that China would implement severe economic sanctions and cause trade problems with Taiwan to punish them economically. \n\nChina is currently doing the same thing with South Korea ever since it announced that it will place THAAD missile defense system on its shores. \n\nThe Chinese government is reducing the number of tour groups to South Korea; movie stars from that country have been banned from performing in China; and, recently, the giant conglomerate Lotte has had unprecedented mass audits across the country. \n\nChina previously banned Norwegian salmon after the Nobel Peace Prize was given to dissident Liu Xiaobo, and reduced trade with Mongolia after it met with the Dalai Lama.\n\nStatus quo no more?\n\nOther countries in the region only have to see the wrath of China if they oppose its strategic interests, and see the benefits if they get closer to Beijing politically. \n\nThe recent warming of ties between China, the Philippines, and Malaysia, which are getting billions of low interest loans and infrastructure investment, show Asian nations the benefits of allying with Beijing over Washington. \n\nTrump's call with President Tsai is a simple and cheap way to let other nations know that American power is back and that Trump will look after US interests, even if that means changing the status quo. \n\nAnd frankly, the status quo has not made the world a safer place in recent decades.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.7672955989837598, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 738, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.67834906594, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205110000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.607046070460701, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/23/us/chattanooga-school-bus-crash/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 873, "scraper_regex": 1165}}, "headline": "Chattanooga bus crash: 6 children dead; Titans to help victims' families", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1165, "date": "20161123200000", "story_content": "While the rest of the country gives thanks Thursday, six Chattanooga families are grieving the absence of a child from their table. \n\nKeonte Wilson. Cor'Dayja Jones. Zyaira Mateen. D'Myunn Brown. Zoie Nash. Zyanna Harris. \n\nAll six perished after their school bus crashed and flipped over, leading to intense scrutiny over the driver's actions and safety record. \n\nNine-year-old Cor'Dayja Jones' family was looking forward to celebrating not just Thanksgiving with her, but also her upcoming 10th birthday on December 11. \n\n\"One of the things that I remember about Cor'Dayja was that she always smiled, and she would always give you a hug,\" her cousin LaFrederick Thirkill told CNN on Thursday. \n\nBut on this day of grace, both Thirkill and the family of bus driver Johnthony Walker are also heartbroken for one another. \n\n\"I pray for his family as well as I do (for) mine and the other families that were involved in this terrible accident,\" Thirkill said.  \n\nAfter Monday's crash, Walker's sister called Thirkill, the principal of a neighboring elementary school.  \n\n\"She has students who attend my school as well, and so she called, very emotional and obviously grieving,\" Thirkill recalled. \n\n\"She just reassured me that her brother was a good person and she said that he was terribly heartbroken by the accident. She said that he was driving and he hit a curb or something and he tried to overcorrect the bus, and caused it to flip over.\" \n\nSixth child dies\n\nEight-year-old Keonte Wilson, who was seriously injured in the crash, \"was a tough little boy\" and put up a valiant fight for two days in the hospital, his brother Kevin McClendon told CNN. But on Wednesday, he became the sixth child to die. \n\n\"I know he's in a better place,\" McClendon said.\n\nWho were the Chattanooga bus crash victims? \n\nMore than a dozen other students were injured -- some with severe head or spinal injuries. And because some of the victims were so young, many of them didn't know their parents' names or phone numbers -- leading to massive confusion at the hospital and hours of anxiety for parents waiting to know whether their child was dead or alive. \n\nHelp from near and far \n\nA flood of good Samaritans, ranging from the NFL's Tennessee Titans to strangers in Ohio, have rallied to help families of those killed and wounded. \n\nThe Titans will donate $25,000 to The Woodmore Fund, benefiting Woodmore Elementary School families affected by the crash. \n\nThe #Titans will donate $25,000 to The Woodmore Fund following the tragic school bus accident in Chattanooga: https://t.co/XC40fAMLaP pic.twitter.com/wSoNoqyMKp\u2014 Tennessee Titans (@Titans) November 23, 2016\n\nThe players will also wear \"W.E.S.\" decals on their helmets when they play the Chicago Bears on Sunday. \n\nAnd in Chattanooga, throngs of residents lined up for hours to donate blood to the wounded victims. Those with desperately needed O-negative blood got fast-tracked. \n\nAnd amid the scramble to save victims at Children's Hospital at Erlanger, pediatric surgeon Dr. Lisa Smith said strangers have donated teddy bears, money and even pizzas ordered by people as far away as Ohio. \n\nBus driver crashed twice in two months \n\nAs the community mourns, investigators are trying to determine what exactly went wrong. \n\nThe fatal accident was the second time in two months that Walker crashed a school bus.\n\nIn September, Walker was driving around a blind curve in a residential area when he failed to yield the right of way and sideswiped another car, according to the accident report.\n\nIn the earlier crash, which police Sgt. Austin Garrett described as a \"minor wreck,\" Walker \"crossed over into the oncoming traffic lane to maneuver the bus through the curve and struck vehicle #2 in doing so,\" the report states. \"There were no children in the front rows, and no reports of any injuries. The damage (was) minor to both vehicles.\"\n\nNow, investigators are trying to determine why Walker, who received his commercial driver's license in April, was driving \"well above\" the speed limit Monday when the bus hit a mailbox, a utility pole and flipped on its side as it struck a tree.\n\nGarrett said no traces of alcohol or drugs were found in Walker's blood. He said investigators had obtained warrants for all data devices on the bus and were reviewing video of front, back and side views of the vehicle.\n\nAnother unanswered question: Why was the bus not on its designated route at the time of the crash?\n\nThe bus was heading down a narrow, winding road well above the speed limit of 30 mph, according to an arrest affidavit for Walker.\n\n\"Mr. Walker lost control of the bus and swerved off of the roadway to the right, striking an elevated driveway and mailbox, swerved to the left and began to overturn, striking a telephone pole and a tree,\" the affidavit states.\n\nChattanooga Police Chief Fred Fletcher told HLN the \"driving was reckless and unsafe for conditions at the time.\"\n\nWalker now faces five counts of vehicular homicide, as well charges of reckless endangerment and reckless driving. A sixth vehicular homicide charge likely will be added, police spokeswoman Elisa Myzal said.\n\nInvestigating the bus company\n\nDurham School Services CEO David Duke said the company, which runs the bus service, was cooperating with the federal and local investigations.\n\n\"My responsibility now is to look for answers -- answers about why this tragedy occurred and answers for how we can make sure that this never, ever happens again,\" he said in a YouTube statement. \n\nThe bus company in 2007 was given a \"conditional safety rating\" from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. It was later upgraded to \"satisfactory\" after the unspecified problems were resolved, Hart said. A website lists the most recent satisfactory rating date as July 31, 2015.\n\n\"We will be exploring what were the deficiencies,\" Hart said.\n\nThe first lawsuit stemming from the crash was filed by the family of injured student Jamar Boling, 8. The complaint, which says Boling suffered significant physical and psychological injuries, names the driver and Durham School Services.\n\nGrandmother of victim: 'I ain't accept it yet'\n\nOf the six children who died, three were fourth-graders, one was a first-grader and one was a kindergartner. \n\nZakiyyah Mateen still can't process the death of her 6-year-old granddaughter, Zyaira Mateen.\n\n\"That was my baby,\" she said Wednesday. \"I ain't accept it yet.\"\n\nAnother victim, 9-year-old Zoie Nash, was \"a little angle here on earth\" who was about to celebrate her 10th birthday, her uncle Antwon McClain said. \n\nMcClain remembered the fourth-grader as \"a sweet, sweet girl. A little angel here on earth.\"\n\n\"The family is still going to have a birthday party for her in her honor,\" he said.\n\nChattanooga Mayor Andy Berke said the tragedy should remind everyone to not take their families and children for granted. \n\n\"We certainly understand on this week of Thanksgiving (that) we all need to be with our families, appreciating them, thinking about our kids,\" he said, \"because there are a lot of families hurting in our city right now.\" ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.4140129089355495, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 873, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.62833529504, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161123200000, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.55097365406644, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/25/asia/typhoon-nock-ten-nina-philippines/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 540, "scraper_regex": 452}}, "headline": "Typhoon Nock-ten strands thousands in Philippines", "wordcount_as_scraped": 452, "date": "20161225060000", "story_content": "Super Typhoon Nock-ten has left more than 11,000 passengers stranded after roaring into the Philippines and forcing the closure of ports in the Southeast Asian country.\n\nThe typhoon, known locally as Nina, made landfall over Bato in the province of Catanduanes at 8 p.m. local time (7 a.m. ET) on Christmas day. \n\nAuthorities rushed to evacuate thousands of residents from low-lying areas of the eastern Philippines ahead of Nock-ten's arrival and the provinces of Catanduanes and Albay were declared under a \"state of imminent danger/disaster.\"\n\nSome 11,476 passengers, more than 1,000 cargo ships and over a dozen other vessels were stranded in various ports in the region, the Philippines National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported Sunday.\n\nPhilippines Coast Guard spokesman Armand Balilo told CNN the storm had forced various ports to temporarily close.

A court will now decide whether she should be kicked out of office, a process that could take up to 180 days. \n\nThe drama surrounds Park's friend and informal adviser, Choi Soon-sil, who prosecutors have detained on charges of abuse of power and attempted fraud following accusations she had access to secret government documents and intervened in state affairs. \n\nWho are the Chois? \n\nPark's relationship with Choi and her father Choi Tae-min has long been controversial in Korea. \n\nThe elder Choi first became close with Park following the death of her mother at the hands of a North Korean assassin in 1974, while Park's father, dictator Park Chung-hee, was president. \n\nAccording to the Korea Times, Choi founded the Eternal Life Church in the 1970s, mixing aspects Christianity, Buddhism and indigenous Korean religion Cheondism, which incorporates elements of shamanism. \n\nChoi named himself a modern day Buddha and called for all people to strive for eternal life. \n\nA confidential 2007 US diplomatic cable, published by Wikileaks, referenced rumors that Choi had \"complete control over Park's body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result.\" \n\nAfter Park's father was assassinated in 1979 by the then director of the Korean equivalent of the CIA, his killer cited Choi's relationship with the younger Park as one of the reasons.\n\nEven members of Park's family expressed concern. Her younger sister Guen-ryong and brother Ji-man filed a petition in 1990 to then-President Roh Tae-woo expressing concerns that Choi was manipulating Park. \n\nWhat influence did Choi Soon-sil have? \n\nAfter her father died in 1994 at age 82, Choi Soon-sil succeeded him as church leader and spiritual mentor to Park, as the former first daughter became a political force of her own. \n\n\"The family has had an extraordinary influence over Park Geun-hye for essentially her entire adult life,\" David Kang, a Korea expert at the University of Southern California, told CNN. \n\n\"It's much more than simply, 'oh she knows this person,' it's deeply intertwined, almost like they're Rasputin and Park Geun-hye is just a puppet.\"\n\nThough she never held an official position, recent revelations showed that Choi was given advance access to presidential speeches and other documents. \n\nLocal media and opposition parties have accused Choi of abusing her relationship with the president to force companies to donate millions of dollars to foundations she runs. \n\nIn a televised apology, Park said Choi looked at \"some documents\" for a certain period of time after Park took office, but didn't specify what they were.\n\n\"I am shocked and my heart is breaking for causing public concern,\" Park said. \n\nShamanism and cults\n\nWhile much of the outrage has surrounded Choi's alleged influence over Korean politics, the scandal has also shone a light on the prevalence of cults and alternative religious movements in the country. \n\nKorean shamanism, or Muism, is an ethnic Korean religion with similarities to Japanese Shintoism. \n\nAccording to the Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Muism \"focuses on solving the problems of daily life through communication between humans and the spiritual world, with shamans acting as liaisons.\" \n\nThe country is also home to the Unification Church, known as the \"Moonies\" for founder Sun Myung Moon, famous for mass weddings and allegedly forcing members to disconnect from their families. \n\nWhile Christianity and Buddhism dominate Korean religious life, some churches incorporate shamanistic practices and many people consult with fortune tellers or shamans. \n\nChoi's movement mixed strands of all three faiths, and claimed the ability to communicate with the dead and produce objects offering magical protection, according to Korean media.\n\nDuring Park's inauguration, the President stood in front of a tree bedecked with colorful silk purses, reportedly recommended by Choi to bring prosperity and good fortune. \n\nStemming the scandal\n\nThousands of protesters took to the streets to call for Park's resignation after news of the scandal broke. Prosecutors investigated Choi and placed her under \"emergency detention.\" \n\nSouth Korean presidents are immune from prosecution for anything but insurrection or treason, and Park's term wasn't due to end until 2018. \n\nThe country's constitutional court will now deliberate the impeachment motion against Park, a process that could take up to 180 days. \n\nPrime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn is now acting President, and will hold the post for the duration of the court's deliberation.\n\nReputational fallout \n\nPark's approval ratings have plummeted, hampering her administration's ability to tackle key economic and security issues. \n\nThe scandal exacerbated her Saenuri Party's weak standing in the National Assembly following April elections. \n\nNorth Korea was also quick to rain criticism on Park, a longtime target of the country's propaganda machine. \n\n\"Choi's acts are clear evidence of Park Geun-hye being an incompetent old person,\" an article on propaganda website Uriminzokkiri said, according to the Korea Times.\n\n\"No one has ever heard of such an ugly political scandal involving the President memorizing speeches inspected by a random swindler anywhere else in the world.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.08163261413574, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 826, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.7453943401, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161102090000, "PurityVirtue": 4, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.7845036319612597, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/30/politics/supreme-court-detained-immigrants/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Supreme Court wrestles with status of detained immigrants", "wordcount_as_scraped": 795, "date": "20161130200000", "story_content": "A divided Supreme Court Wednesday grappled with whether it is unlawful to subject thousands of immigrants fighting deportation to long-term detention without individualized bond hearings.\n\nThe case, brought by a class of immigrants who seek hearings to prove that they are neither flight risk nor a danger to society, comes at a time when immigration groups lament the fact that the Obama administration deported record numbers of immigrants and the Trump administration has vowed to crack down further on enforcement. \n\n\"Under the Obama administration, immigration detention has skyrocketed to record levels,\" said Cecilia Wang, the director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project and a lawyer for the class of immigrants. Wang said the case \"is fundamentally about whether the executive branch has unchecked power to detain someone without a hearing --something that is contrary to the most basic principles behind the founding of the United Sates.\" \n\nLower courts are divided on how they interpret the immigration detention statutes at issue in the case. \n\nThe liberal justices on the bench seemed sympathetic to parts of an opinion by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that ruled in favor of the class of immigrants, requiring an individualized procedure after six months of detention. The court stressed that while it was mandating that immigration judges hold hearings for certain individuals, it was not ordering them to release any single individual.  \n\nIn court, Justice Elena Kagan expressed concern that deportation proceedings are sometimes delayed because of government backlog. \n\n\"I think we would all look at our precedent and we would say, you can't just lock people up without any finding of dangerousness, without any finding of flight risk, for an indefinite period of time, and not run into due process,\" she said. \n\n\"If these are people who have been here for decades,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked the government lawyer, \"don't' you think due process would require some periodic review to ensure that these people are properly held?\"\n\nActing Solicitor General Ian H. Gershengorn rejected the lower court opinion, calling it a \"one size fits all rule\" that would undo the \"legislative balance.\" Congress sought between providing procedural protections for aliens whom the government wishes to remove, \"but at the same time addressing concerns about recidivism and flight risk,\" he said. \n\nMore than once, Gershengorn stressed that immigrants can seek relief by filing suit in federal court, but lawyers for the immigrants called that a non-starter because the class consists of people without representation who are not familiar enough with the legal system to file such a claim. \n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy -- often the critical swing vote -- did not seem to tip his hand. If the court finds itself evenly split it could choose to hold the case until there is a ninth justice. In a separate case back in 2003 Kennedy approved the detention of aliens but plaintiffs distinguish that case arguing that it was premised on the notion that the detentions would be brief. \n\nAt one point Chief Justice John Roberts questioned whether the case should be sent down to the lower court for further review. \n\n\"Our job is to read the statute and if it presents -- if it's unconstitutional, that's our job,\" he said. \"But we can't just write a different statute because we think it would be more administrable.\" \n\nKagan was quick to push back. \"We're not making up a statute\" she said \"we're devising a constitutional limit.\"\n\nThe case is complicated by the diversity of the class presented as well as the fact that three immigration statutes are in play. \n\nThe class of immigrants in the case are all incarcerated and they include lawful permanent residents with minor criminal history and asylum seekers who have passed an initial screening but who are waiting for the chance to raise their claims. Lawyers for the class says that it does not include any individuals that the government deems to be national security risks. They are covered by separate statutes not at issue. \n\nThe lead plaintiff, Alejandro Rodriguez, is a lawful permanent resident who was brought to the United States as an infant. He was employed as a dental assistant when he was put in removal proceedings based on possession of a controlled substance and \"joyriding.\" He was detained for over three years while he challenged his removal. He eventually managed to appeals his case in a process that took over seven years. \n\n\"Mr. Rodriguez's case is not unique\" his lawyers argued. \n\nThe government argued that the lower court opinion represented a \"dramatic and wholesale revision\" to the long standing system and replacing it with \"a radical new one in which aliens arriving at our borders or convicted of crimes have a presumptive entitlement to be released in the United States, \"if custody during removal proceedings last six months.\" ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.04907989501953, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 761, "FairnessVirtue": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.13616250612, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 16, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 47, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161130200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 6.176084099868589, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/politics/trump-policy-day-6/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00b7": [5292, 5373, 5636]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 772, "scraper_regex": 875}}, "headline": "Trump's policies: Day 6", "wordcount_as_scraped": 875, "date": "20170126150000", "story_content": "The anti-immigration world was getting antsy, but Wednesday the Trump administration delivered executive orders that lay the groundwork for building that wall and set the stage for more deportations of undocumented immigrants. Those who have not been charged with a crime but are suspected to pose a public safety or national security risk could become targets. And President Trump isn't finished. More immigration-related executive actions are expected on day seven. \n\n \n\nACTION PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK WEDNESDAY...\n\nIMMIGRATION --  Following through on several of his more controversial campaign promises, President Trump signed executive orders at DHS Wednesday afternoon aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration. The orders help build the wall, dramatically increase deportation of undocumented immigrants, including those without criminal records, and defund sanctuary cities, among others initiatives.\n\n \n\nWHAT ELSE IS NEW ON DAY SIX...\n\nIMMIGRATION -- CNN's Manu Raju, Deirdre Walsh and Tom LoBianco report: the GOP is considering paying for the wall through a supplemental funding package focused on border security. House Speaker Paul Ryan told Republicans at a closed-door meeting today that this is an option the GOP is looking at, two sources said.\n\nBuilding the wall may be a popular rallying cry, but it is a lot easier said than done. There are many complications involved in turning Trump's signature campaign promise into concrete action.\n\nHow much will the wall cost? At least $10 billion, but maybe much more. Republicans are eying a special budget bill to pay for it.\n\nWhat are sanctuary cities, anyway, and how much can Trump really do about them?\n\nIn the midst of Trump's executive orders on immigration, top Mexican officials are scheduled to meet with senior Trump advisers, including Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon. They'll bring a \"Mexico first\" message to deliver to the Trump administration.\n\nWill Trump go after remittances from Mexicans living in the US -- Mexico's largest source of cash -- to pay for the wall? Seizing them may have a potentially destabilizing effect on the already fragile Mexican economy.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, from Silicon Valley, has introduced a bill aimed at reforming the H-1B visa.\n\nDespite Trump's executive orders and heated rhetoric on immigration, he has yet to act on DACA or DAPA -- In fact, the U.S. is still accepting DACA applications.\n\nCNN's Ed Lavendera traveled to the border. His series on building the wall is a must-see.\n\n \n\nOBAMACARE -- Speaker Ryan met with the leaders of the National Governors Association today and chairman Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-VA) said \"it was clear from Speaker Ryan today that they want to block grant\" Medicaid, something he said would \"be catastrophic.\" McAuliffe and vice chair Gov. Brian Sandoval (R-NV) also spoke about trade and immigration among other issues.\n\n After two full work days with the new president, Congress is taking a break. But instead of rest and relaxation, the party is working hard to stay united while figuring out how to handle President Trump's unpredictable nature. \n\nSen. Rand Paul introduced his own Obamacare replacement bill. The plan includes an HSA tax credit.\n\n \n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nTrump has put the EPA on notice, freezing grants and contracts to states.\n\nReuters reported that the EPA is purging its climate change websites. After the less than one week in office, some employees are \"terrified\" of Trump.\n\nThe environmentalists are fighting back. Seven Greenpeace activists scaled a crane in downtown Washington to unveil a 70 by 30 foot \"Resist\" poster.\n\nTrump is already motivating the scientific community to get more involved in politics. The Atlantic reports on the creation of 314 Action, a new PAC designed to support scientists and to get a \"science version of Emily's list\" to run for office.\n\nThe house science chairman is asking Americans to trust the information they get from the President over the news produced by the media.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Badlands National Park tweeted and then deleted facts about climate change potentially running afoul of the administration's views on the matter. At least, that's how it seemed. Turns out it was a former employee who broke bad and used the account without authorization.\n\n \n\nENVIRONMENT/TRADE --  The Trump effect crosses the pond. During her weekly Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May was pressed to confront Trump on a number of issues, including the Paris Climate Agreement and the potential U.S.-U.K. trade agreement.\n\n \n\nTRADE --  Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA with the goal of bringing back manufacturing jobs to the U.S. Here's what a better deal might look like.\n\n \n\nTAXES --  Politico reports: \"Some Trump administration officials and Capitol Hill Republicans are discussing the possibility of passing sweeping tax cuts without offsetting revenue increases \u2014 an idea that threatens to balloon the deficit and undermine the GOP's reputation as the party of fiscal discipline.\"\n\n \n\nEVERYTHING --  According to Change.org, nearly six million people have signed 6,000 petitions related to Trump's administration. Among the most popular are those pushing him to act on climate change, and to keep the pre-existing condition clause in Obamacare.\n\n \n\nLOOKING AHEAD...\n\n\u00b7         THURSDAY -- IMMIGRATION --  Trump executive action on trade expected.\n\n\u00b7         THURSDAY/FRIDAY -- EVERYTHING --  Senate Democrats continue their retreat (Thurs) in Sherpherdstown, West Virginia while a combined House and Senate Republicans continue their retreat (Thurs/Fri) in Philadelphia with Trump expected to attend Thursday.\n\n\u00b7         FRIDAY -- TRADE -- U.K. Prime Minister May is expected to discuss a post-Brexit U.S./U.K. deal with Trump at their White House meeting.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.5494636297225999, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 772, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.25500250727, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 9, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.7564766839378194, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/13/arts/leonardo-da-vinci-lost-drawing-discovered/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [477]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 525, "scraper_regex": 588}}, "headline": "Old sketch is da Vinci worth $16M, retired doctor is told", "wordcount_as_scraped": 588, "date": "20161213190000", "story_content": "A drawing believed to be by Italian master Leonardo da Vinci was discovered in Paris when a retired doctor brought a portfolio of works to Tajan auction house for a valuation. \n\nWhat's more, the auction house estimates \"The Martyred Saint Sebastian\" could be worth as much as 15 million euros ($16 million).  \n\n\"The doctor couldn't have imagined there could have been something so important in his portfolio,\" says Thadd\u00e9e Prate, director of Old Masters paintings at the French boutique auction house. \n\n\"Discoveries happen, yes, but with lower importance, of course. Leonardo, I think this will be only once in a lifetime.\" \n\nAn astonishing find \n\n\"The Martyred Saint Sebastian\" depicts the early Christian saint bound to a tree. This new discovery is the third known da Vinci sketch of the subject. The artist mentioned eight drawings of the saint in his Codex Atlanticus.\n\nRead: Stolen Dutch art retrieved after more than a decade\n\nThe doctor, whose identity has not been disclosed, brought 14 drawings inherited from his father to Prate's Paris office in March. He'd had the drawings for years, but only after retiring did he resolve to have them valued. \n\nPrate assumes the doctor's father, a book collector, acquired the drawings at a bookstore in the early 20th century, as they had all been mounted on paper mats rather than framed. \n\nIntrigued by the drawing's apparent age, Prate enlisted Patrick de Bayser, an expert in the valuation of Old Masters drawings, to confirm the artist. The paper frame had the name Michelangelo, but the expert doubted that was the artist of this particular drawing. \n\nNoticing the traces of markings on the back, de Bayser removed the drawing from its backing, revealing diagrams of light and shadow and notes written right-to-left -- further suggesting a left-handed artist like da Vinci. \n\nSoon after, Carmen C. Bambach, curator of Italian and Spanish drawings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the world's pre-eminent da Vinci authority, confirmed the attribution, describing it as \"quite incontestable\" and an \"open-and-shut case\" in an interview with the New York Times. She estimates the drawing was completed between 1482 and 1485. \n\nA new record? \n\nIf all goes according to plan, Rodica Seward, president of Tajan, says \"The Martyred Saint Sebastian\" will hit the auction block in early June as part of its annual Old Masters sale, with an estimated price of 15 million euros ($16 million) -- $4 million more than the current record for a da Vinci sketch, set in 2001 at a Christie's auction. \n\n\"It's not comparable (to the other drawings),\" Seward says. \"This is a very unusual drawing, it's very complete. It's got a background and scenery behind, which none of the other Saint Sebastian drawings have. This is an incredible discovery.\"\n\nRead: Where are the world's most famous looted artworks?\n\n\"(Da Vinci is) the most important artist from all over the world, I think, from any time. Each little point we can add to his work is very important for our knowledge of the artist and his work,\" Prate added.\n\nBut before that auction can go forward, there are a few uncertainties to be overcome. The drawing must first be approved for a passport, allowing it to be sold internationally. \n\nUntil then, French national museums have the opportunity to preempt the sale, negotiating with the house directly under the claim that it's a national treasure. \n\nBut Seward is hopeful that it will be opened to the international community. \n\n\"We applied for the passport,\" she says. \"Now it's in God's hands.\" ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.01867568492889, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 525, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.01235851102, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 6, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.85714285714286, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/03/us/oakland-fire-social-media/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 504, "scraper_regex": 567}}, "headline": "Desperate search for loved ones after Oakland fire", "wordcount_as_scraped": 567, "date": "20161204090000", "story_content": "Concerned family and friends of the two dozen people still missing after a fatal fire ravaged an Oakland, California, warehouse are using social media to find loved ones and offer support.\n\nThe blaze broke out Friday night in the two-story building, which housed artist studios and events and was hosting an electronic music show.

But now that the election results are in, it's taking on a different meaning. \n\nFor some, it's a catchy way to sum up their rage about the President-elect. But others are taking things a step further, signing an online petition and writing letters to members of the Electoral College, asking them not to vote the way their states did at the polls.  \n\nCould that happen? The Internet rumor debunking website Snopes.com describes the prospect as \"extremely, extremely unlikely,\" noting that it would be \"wholly unprecedented in American history and would require a sudden and drastic change in the United States' political traditions.\"\n\nThe Electoral College itself has also become a focus for some protesters, since Clinton won the popular vote but lost the election.\n\n2. Build bridges, not walls\n\nTrump made immigration a focal point of his campaign, and it's a key issue for many protesters who are against Trump's vows to deport undocumented immigrants. \n\n\"I'm out here for my undocumented friends,\" protester Spencer Smith, 19, told CNN in Atlanta.\n\nAt protests in Miami, demonstrators held signs that said, \"build bridges, not walls,\" taking aim at Trump's oft-touted plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.\n\nIs there any chance the wall plan could come off the table? Don't hold your breath, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, one of Trump's advisers on immigration, told CNN affiliate KWCH this week.\n\n\"There's no question the wall is going to get built,\" Kobach said. \"The only question is how quickly will it get done and who pays for it?\"\n\nWhether or not Trump heeds protesters' calls, building a wall along the border may be harder than it sounds.\n\n3. Making a statement\n\nSome protesters say they know Trump will take the reins January 20, but they want to make it clear that they're not happy about the election results -- and they're not going to be quiet about it.\n\nProtesters in Iowa this week had two main goals, said Rachel Walerstein, who attended protest in Iowa. First, they wanted to let people know that rhetoric-fueled violence against people of color, immigrants and LGBT people won't stand, she said. \n\n\"The second is to make a statement of political instability to render it difficult to govern, and in particular, to make it impossible for Trump to implement his policies in the first 100 days,\" she said. \"For me, it's important to make these statements known and visible.\"\n\n\"It's mostly to raise awareness,\" said Dalina Aim\u00e9e Perdomo, who also joined protests in Iowa City this week and said she felt angry and disappointed that her state had gone with conservative choices at the polls. \"We gathered to share how we felt and how our families felt.\"\n\nTrump has slammed protesters as \"paid professionals,\" but later praised their passion on Twitter.\n\nLove the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016\n\n4. Trump should denounce the divisive things he's said \n\n\"He needs to really address all the divisive, hateful things he's said in the past and recant them, denounce them,\" protester Nick Truesdale told CNN in New York on Friday.\n\nTrump told The Wall Street Journal this week that he doesn't think his rhetoric on the campaign trail went too far. But he also said he wanted people to come together, according to the newspaper.\n\n\"I want a country that loves each other,\" he told the Journal this week. \"I want to stress that.\"\n\nOthers have called for Trump to denounce an upcoming KKK parade scheduled to celebrate his victory in North Carolina.\n\nTrump himself hasn't spoken out publicly about the event, but the North Carolina Republican Party condemned it.\n\n5. 'Not my president'\n\nAcross the country, protesters have been waving signs that say \"not my president.\" \n\nOrganizers of a protest in Atlanta said their message is simple. \"We do not respect the fact that Trump is president of the United States,\" they wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"No to Trump and no to any future leaders who prey on our fear and lie to us plainly, be they dressed as friends or foes. No to a president that wants to ban all Muslims. No to a president who calls Mexicans rapists,\" the Facebook invite for an Atlanta protest says. \"No to rape culture. No to a president that not so subtly romanticizes white supremacy and mourns its loss though we all know it has been alive and well. No to leaders who propagate the destruction of our environment.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 6, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.11627912521362, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 785, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.17010832258, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161112050000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6942675159235696, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/21/politics/womens-march-protest-hats/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 823, "scraper_regex": 879}}, "headline": "Two very different meanings for two brightly colored hats", "wordcount_as_scraped": 879, "date": "20170122030000", "story_content": "Two very different types of crowds visited Washington in the past couple days -- one jubilantly cheering the swearing in of the 45th President of the United States, the other holding up signs that displayed messages like \"Awful Man.\"\n\nBut there was one thing many of these individuals had in common: many, many brightly colored hats. \n\nThere is perhaps no other symbol that so encapsulates President Donald Trump's election than the bright red \"Make America Great Again\" hat, and they could be seen all over the city on the day of Trump's inauguration.\n\nOne day later, bright pink hats could be seen all over the city as people flocked for the Women's March as part of a grassroots movement to wear handmade, cat-eared knit hats, dubbed \"pussyhats,\" in a show of solidarity and support for women's rights. \n\nCNN spoke with the attendees of both crowds, asking what the hats meant to them and what they expected in the next four years of a Trump presidency. \n\nWhat the hat means\n\n\"That's what Trump's known for, literally 'Make America Great Again,' Mackenzie Zipfel of Annapolis, Maryland, told CNN, pointing to the phrase emblazoned on her head. \"And he wore it all the time, so I was just like what better way to support him than buy a hat?\"\n\nIt was a message many other attendees echoed.\n\n\"It's Make America Great Again: We've been there before, we need to get back there again. We're optimistic, we're cautiously optimistic, and we're just looking forward to the new journey,\" Lynn Jones of Annandale, Virginia, told CNN. \n\nHowever one attendee, a self-admitted Hillary Clinton voter, said he was there to witness a historic moment and bought the hat \"mainly for the rain,\" Roger Weng of Los Angeles said with a laugh. \n\nLeah Mooney of Coatesville, Pennsylania, told CNN her pink hat was a message of solidarity. \n\n\"It also goes back to his famous quote and that I don't even want to say,\" Mooney said, referencing vulgar comments Trump made in 2005 that surfaced during the election about grabbing a woman's genitals. \"Objectify women, but we're going to stand up back to you.\"\n\nA number of men were also spotted wearing the hat, including Robert Hampton of Indianapolis, Indiana. \n\n\"This isn't just a problem for women, this is a problem for everyone, we're all equal,\" he said. \n\nLooking for unity\n\nAs attendees at the inauguration waited to enter security to the National Mall, many groups of protesters were also present, doing their best to send their own message.\n\n\"They need to give him a chance, because they really don't know anything, he hasn't even had a chance to do anything yet,\" Gabriella Zakrocki of Bel Air, Maryland, replied when asked what she'd say to them. \n\n\"I would say that they just need to look at the other side just like we did when Obama was becoming President,\" Craig Zawalich of Port Richie, Florida, told CNN. \"I think if we just got along we could make things better, a better place for everybody, not just a certain crowd.\"\n\nBut marchers the next day were not ready to forget many of the issues that had turned them against Trump during the election. \n\n\"They're blind to a lot of the injustices that happen everyday,\" Washingtonian Willie Madien said. \n\n\"Get out of your state, meet new people, and look around -- everybody's working hard to make a buck and to get ahead,\" said Linda Greenwood of Huntington Woods, Michigan. \n\nLooking for optimism \n\nUnsurprisingly, many attendees at the inauguration were optimistic for the next four years under a Trump administration, but admitted there would be challenges. \n\n\"I feel it's going to be a challenge. I don't feel everything will be as smooth sailing as I think it's going -- as everybody would like it to be,\" Zawalich said. \"I think there's going to be some backlash on things but I think we'll get through it and I think everything is going to work out and I think even the people who didn't support Trump are going to be very happy with the results.\"\n\nMany attendees said their support for Trump was about a need for change, and they trusted Trump's ability to deliver. \n\nBut a day later, there was also some optimism for the future even as marchers bemoaned Trump's policies or tweets. \n\n\"I have to be optimistic that something good has to come from this. I mean, you have to have optimism to manifest into the universe and something good has to come,\" Pittsburgh resident Danielle Ivkovich said.\n\nEmily Hardykarska of Lafayette, Indiana, said the huge crowds that turned out for the march invigorated her. \n\n\"People from all over the world here today, makes me a little emotional, but I know that I'm not alone, and none of us are alone and we can do so much together,\" she said. \n\n\"I keep trying to find the silver lining that he does have a message, he's got a plan, a solid plan. I haven't quite seen it. I don't want him to fail, because it's our country,\" Mooney said. \n\nBonnie Mitchell, a Washington resident, was on her way home after attending the march, pink hat still firmly on her head. \n\n\"I pray that the next four years will run smoothly for all,\" she said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.43171811103821, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 823, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.0855568633599995, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170122030000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.06561360874848, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/james-comey-fbi-donald-trump/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1142, "scraper_regex": 1218}}, "headline": "Critical Dems hope Comey can help curb Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1218, "date": "20161115010000", "story_content": "Democrats blame FBI Director James Comey for Hillary Clinton's electoral loss, but it's beginning to dawn on them that he could serve a role in curbing some of the possible plans of the Trump administration.\n\nTrump, who was sharply critical of the FBI chief during his campaign, raised the prospect in an interview broadcast Sunday that Comey may have to audition to keep his job.\n\nAsked whether he would seek Comey's resignation, Trump, the President-elect, told CBS News' \"60 Minutes:\" \"I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don't -- I haven't made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot ... I would certainly like to talk to him. And -- see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I'd answer a question like that.\"\n\nComey has almost seven years remaining in his 10-year term. A president can fire him for cause. The political repercussions of doing that are another matter. The 10-year term is intended as a way to give FBI directors a measure of political independence that spans presidential administrations.\n\nCounterterrorism is the FBI's top priority and those matters are likely to make up the bulk of the interaction between FBI director and president.\n\nBut during his campaign, Trump also advocated discriminatory policies such as surveillance of mosques and compiling a database of Muslims that are likely unconstitutional. He also embraced the use of torture, including waterboarding and other so-called enhanced interrogation techniques that are now banned. Speaking to a rally in February, he said \"torture works.\"\n\nTrump also has raised the possibility of reopening a federal investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, a matter Comey has signaled is now closed.\n\nComey in recent months has declined to comment on questions about Trump. It's not clear when the new President plans to sit down with the FBI director.\n\nAttempting to push through discriminatory policies would meet resistance among career lawyers at the Justice Department and elsewhere in the government.\n\n\"There are thousands and thousands of people in the government who are going to have to resist what Trump and his entourage are planning,\" said Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman and top aide to former Attorney General Eric Holder. \"And Jim Comey is one of the most prominent and powerful of those people.\"\n\nComey has a history of bucking presidents. In 2004, as the Justice Department's No. 2 official, he refused to reauthorize a surveillance program ordered by President George W. Bush. The episode included a dramatic showdown between Comey and White House officials at the hospital bedside of Attorney General John Ashcroft. He and other top officials threatened to resign until Bush made changes to quell the rebellion.\n\nFrom ballots to Bannon: What's happened in one week\n\nThree years later, as the Bush administration tried to save the shaky tenure of then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Comey, by then no longer in the government, appeared before a Senate hearing to retell the story of the hospital incident. His testimony describing the confrontation with Gonzales, at the time the White House's top lawyer, sealed the fate of the embattled attorney general. \n\nThe 2016 political maelstrom that engulfed Comey and the FBI is exactly what Comey tried to avoid, people close to the FBI director say. The FBI worked to complete the Clinton investigation before the July Democratic convention.\n\nNo one could have counted on the intrusion of Anthony Weiner, the disgraced congressman and estranged husband of Clinton's longtime aide Huma Abedin.\n\nFBI investigators looking into allegations that Weiner sent sexually explicit messages to an underage girl stumbled on a batch of Abedin's emails that appeared to relate to the Clinton probe.\n\nEven if Clinton had won the election, Comey would have faced similar awkward questions.\n\nIn July, when he announced a recommendation of no charges in the Clinton email investigation, he also delivered stinging criticism of the Democratic presidential candidate's carelessness in using the private server. In October, 11 days before the election, Comey dispensed with longstanding Justice Department police not to comment on politically sensitive investigations and sent a letter to Congress advising that the FBI was investigating the recently discovered batch of Abedin emails.\n\nAfter blasting Clinton, Pence in an email battle of his own\n\nThe incoming Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, before the election, said he had lost confidence in Comey's ability to continue in office.\n\nPeople close to Comey say he has no plans to leave the job prematurely.\n\nOne senior US government official says that asking Comey to leave office now would be bad for the institutions involved, including the FBI and the White House.\n\n\"The purpose of the 10-year term is to put the office above politics,\" the official said.\n\nRick DesLauriers, who served as the bureau's top agent in Boston and held a high-level post at headquarters before retiring, said he imagined things might be awkward between Trump and Comey initially.\n\n\"But if I was a betting man,\" the 26-year veteran agent said, \"I would bet that he'd keep his job.\"\n\nDesLauriers said he suspects former US attorneys and Trump advisers Rudolph Giuliani and Chris Christie, would be able to give the President-elect some perspective on the tough spot Comey found himself in with respect to the investigations involving Clinton.\n\n\"There's no reason for him to be removed for cause -- he's broken no laws,\" he said of Comey.\n\nOne official familiar with Comey's thinking says he's aware \"the first meeting or two will be awkward\" but \"he has no plans to go anywhere. He feels perfectly comfortable in his place,\" one source says.\n\nDespite causing a political firestorm with the letter he sent to Congress about the new emails, he still believes he did the right thing, including the unprecedented July announcement.\n\n\"The big things he decided to do he would do it again,\" one person familiar with the matter said. \n\nSome Clinton supporters aren't yet ready to forgive Comey for his actions in recent months. But they also hope Comey can be the one to stand up to Trump.\n\n\"You can point to a lot of reasons why Hillary Clinton lost but I think the evidence is clear that had Comey not sent his letter 11 days out, Hillary Clinton would be the President-elect right now,\" Miller, the former Justice Department spokesman said. \"He owns that for history. The least he can do is to stand up for fair enforcement of the law inside the Trump administration.\"\n\nEven if Comey survives the Trump audition, there's still the matter of quelling grumbling from some inside the bureau about the handling of the Clinton investigation.\n\nMonths of wrangling, particularly between the FBI's New York office and FBI headquarters, have prompted concerns that FBI leaks could do damage to the bureau's reputation.\n\nFormer FBI Executive Assistant Director Robert Anderson, who worked alongside Comey before retiring last year, acknowledged that there are pockets within the bureau unhappy with Comey's actions surrounding the Clinton email server investigation. But he believes that in time tensions will subside. \n\n\"The bureau has done what it's been doing the last 100 years,\" Anderson said.  \"Overall the men and women in the FBI are very good at what they do and know this will pass.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.1756649017333998, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1142, "FairnessVirtue": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.46630181205, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161115010000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 1.8388791593695302, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/11/americas/brazil-prison-system-corruption/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00f4": [2589]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1080, "scraper_regex": 811}}, "headline": "Brazil prison head removed as country grapples with inmate violence", "wordcount_as_scraped": 811, "date": "20170111200000", "story_content": "As Brazil's beleaguered prisons continue to face problems involving drugs, corruption, escapes and riots, the pressure is on the government to fix what some analysts say are systemic and structural failures of the prison system.\n\nThis weekend saw 26 prisoners killed in a riot Saturday -- the fifth deadly one this year -- and another 28 escape Sunday.\n\nAs the problems mount, some Brazilian states are turning to the federal government for help. \n\nBrazilian President Michel Temer has proposed some fixes, but has not quelled the concerns of some human rights group. \n\n\"We need a more rational prison system in Brazil. Our current system, by no fault of anyone specifically, arrests many people but not always the right people,\" Amnesty International's Human Rights adviser Renata Neder said. \"We have a lot of prisoners who should not be in jail.\"\n\nWave of deadly riots \n\nThe first riot of the year erupted at the Anisio Jobim Prison Complex (Compaj) in the city of Manaus, between incarcerated members of the the Familia do Norte (FDN) and the Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) groups. The riot lasted for more than 17 hours and left 56 dead. \n\nThe macabre nature of some of the deaths was alarming; some of the prisoners were decapitated, with their bodies tossed over the prison gates while others were incinerated in their sleep.\n\nIt even elicited a reaction from Pope Francis.\n\nThe head of that prison has been removed from office while an investigation takes place, state-run media agency Agencia Brasil reported.  \n\nSergio Fontes, the public safety secretary for the state of Amazonas, said that the riot started over control of the drug trade behind the prison walls. \n\n\"They weren't fighting because one is called one thing and the other one is called another. They are fighting for money,\" he said.\n\nPaulo Storani, a security expert and former Rio de Janeiro Elite squad military officer, told CNN he believes the prisoners had access to cell phones and weapons, which may have been smuggled in by family members or lawyers visiting the inmates.\n\n\"Many of these gangs were born within Brazilian prisons in the late '70s and early '80s, so they know how to operate inside the prison walls,\" Storani said. \"The Brazilian penitentiary system has not found a way to control the entry of cell phones, which allows many leaders to turn the prisons into their personal offices.\"\n\nAuthorities in Manaus are also investigating-- and still trying to catch inmates-- after a prison break at the nearby Instituto Penal Ant\u00f4nio Trindade (IPAT).  \n\nAgencia Brasil reports that hours after the riot at Compaj and the prison break at IPAT were quelled, on the other side of town, four inmates were killed at the Prison Unit of Puraquequara (UPP). \n\nLater in the week, in the neighboring state of Roraima, 33 inmates died at the Agricultural Penitentiary of Monte Cristo. Many of them were also beheaded. \n\nBack in Manaus, a few days later, four people died during a riot at the Desembargador Raimundo Vidal Pessoa public jail in the northern part of the country. Three inmates were decapitated and one was asphyxiated. The jail, which was shut down in October because of improper conditions, was reopened to receive inmates after uprisings throughout the state. Nearly 300 prisoners had been transferred to the jail.\n\nState of Brazilian jails \n\nTemer and Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes announced the creation of a new National Security Plan days after the first riot. \n\nTemer vowed to continue working on improving the state of the federal prison system and said he expects to approve the building of 25 new units. \n\nBrazil has the fourth largest prison population in the world, and overcrowding is a significant problem. \n\nMore than 622,000 people are behind bars, according to its justice ministry -- more than the United States, Russia and China. \n\nTemer acknowledged that more jails needed to be built so that jails that accommodate 500 inmates don't have to hold upwards of 1,200. \n\nHis new security plan also includes proposals for bringing technology like metal detectors and cell phone blockers to some of the prisons.\n\nBut Neder of Amnesty International believes the plan is \"too broad\" and says conditions in many of the country's prisons are inhumane.\n\nData from Amnesty shows that the Manaus jail Compaj currently holds over 1,200 prisoners while only having capacity for 770. Amnesty reports that the Monte Cristo prison also is overcrowded, holding over 1,400 prisoners when it should be home to no more than 700.\n\nMoraes, the justice minister, acknowledged this issue during a recent press conference and said he's working with states to reduce the number of \"temporary prisoners,\" which includes those awaiting trial and those who have not yet been convicted.\n\nOrganizations like Amnesty have also called on states to ensure prisoners are receiving water and proper meals as well as providing proper access to health care.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 11, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.8297872543335, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1080, "FairnessVirtue": 6, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.5536036883099995, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 5, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 43, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.98148148148148, "mft_mean": 3.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/trump-travel-ban-world-reaction/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 749, "scraper_regex": 1184}}, "headline": "World leaders react to Trump's travel ban ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1184, "date": "20170130110000", "story_content": "World leaders and prominent figures have blasted US President Donald Trump's temporary ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States as divisive, illegal, insulting and discriminatory.\n\nTrump signed an executive order Friday barring citizens from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan from entering the country for 90 days and suspended the admission of all refugees for 120 days. The order indefinitely bans entry of those fleeing from war-torn Syria.\n\nWhile many countries have lambasted the ban, Muslim-majority nations not on the blacklist have remained largely silent -- with the exception of Pakistan. Australia, which has implemented hard-line policies against refugees, was one of the few nations to voice support for the ban.\n\nHere's what some world figures had to say:\n\nCountries on Trump's banned list\n\nIran: Trump's immigration order is \"insulting\" and a \"gift to extremists,\" the Foreign Affairs Ministry said. Iran will take \"reciprocal measures in order to safeguard the rights of its citizens until the time of the removal of the insulting restrictions of the government of the United States against Iranian nationals.\"\n\nIraq: The Foreign Ministry expressed its \"regret and astonishment\" over the ban, saying it was \"unfortunate\" the decision had been made, despite the two nations achieving victories in their joint fight against ISIS.\n\n\"It is necessary that the new American administration reconsider this wrong decision, and we affirm Iraq's real desire to strengthen and develop the strategic partnership between the two countries and increase the prospects of cooperation in the counter-terrorism field and economic sphere and all (that) serves both countries' interests.\"\n\nSudan: \"The Sudanese citizens living in the United States are known for their good reputation, respect for American laws, and their lack of involvement in radical and criminal acts,\" the Foreign Affairs Ministry said, adding that the Sudanese people are \"heirs to the ancient Nile River civilization, which is marked by tolerance and peaceful coexistence.\" The ministry called on Washington to remove Sudan from the US list of states that sponsor terrorism.\n\nYemen: The ban is \"not justified\" and \"supports the terrorists and sows divisions among people,\" Yemen's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Abdel-Malak al-Mekhlafi posted on Twitter. The Foreign Ministry said that attempts to classify Yemeni citizens as a probable source for terrorism were \"illegal and illegitimate.\"\n\nEuropean allies  \n\nBritain: Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson described the ban as \"divisive and wrong,\" while London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the move was \"shameful and cruel.\" Their comments came two days after Prime Minister Theresa May became the first foreign leader to officially meet with Trump. May and Trump had celebrated their countries' \"special relationship\" Friday, and just hours later the order was signed. May came under pressure from MPs to condemn the ban. \n\nShe eventually put out a statement saying her government did \"not agree\" with it, but said immigration was \"a matter for the government of the United States.\"\n\nWe will protect the rights and freedoms of UK nationals home and abroad. Divisive and wrong to stigmatise because of nationality\u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) January 29, 2017\n\nA petition on the UK Government and Parliament website to prevent Trump from making a state visit to the UK passed the 1 million mark on Monday morning. \n\nFrance: Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that welcoming refugees was \"a duty of solidarity.\" \"Terrorism doesn't have a nationality; discrimination is not an answer,\" he said on Twitter.  \n\nGermany: \"The necessary and decisive fight against terrorism in no way justifies a general suspicion against people of certain beliefs, in this case people of the Muslim faith or from a certain origin,\" Chancellor Angela Merkel said. \"These actions, according to my beliefs, are against the core idea of international aid for refugees and international cooperation.\" \n\nA spokesman for Merkel earlier said that the Chancellor had called Trump on Saturday to explain to him the United States' obligations under the Geneva Convention on refugees.\n\nTurkey: Refugees are welcome, said Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek on Twitter, in one of the few statements to emerge from a Muslim-majority country not on Trump's blacklist. \"We'd happily welcome global talent not allowed back into #USA,\" he wrote.\n\n#RefugeesWelcome in #Turkey, the world's largest refugee hosting country.We'd happily welcome global talent not allowed back into #USA.\u2014 Mehmet Simsek (@memetsimsek) January 29, 2017\n\nAustralia, Canada, Pakistan\n\nAustralia: \"It is vital that every nation is able to control who comes across its borders,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said, becoming one of the few leaders to openly show support for the ban. Turnbull spoke to Trump on Sunday to discuss \"the importance of border security and the threat of illegal and irregular migration.\"\n\nUnder a \"one-off\" agreement, Australia plans to transfer hundreds of refugees currently held in offshore detention centers to the US. Some 1,300 people, including registered refugees, are being held in the Australian government centers on the Pacific Island nation of Nauru and on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island.\n\nCanada: Closer to home, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau defended the importance of welcoming refugees, without explicitly referring to Trump's executive order. He said that those fleeing persecution, terror and war were welcome in Canada.\n\nTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada\u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 28, 2017\n\nPakistan: Even though it's a Muslim-majority country, Pakistan is not on Trump's blacklist. But Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar denounced the travel ban, saying it won't affect terrorists. Instead, Nisar said, it will \"increase the miseries of victims of terrorism.\" \n\n\"The worst sufferers of terrorism are Muslims, and they have given the most sacrifices against this scourge,\" he said. \n\nSaudi Arabia: The government of Saudi Arabia, a Muslim-majority country that is not among the seven countries named in Trump's order, has not publicly taken a position but it's national airline, Saudi Airlines, has issued a statement. The statement, which was translated by CNN, said citizens from the seven affected countries \"will not be permitted to travel with Saudi Airlines. Citizens with diplomatic visas or who work for international organizations and hold valid visas are an exception.\" \n\nThe airline also said passengers with reservations who weren't able to travel to the U.S. because of the ban won't be charged ticket change fees and may be able to receive a full refund. \n\nEurope's far-right cheers\n\nBritain's most vocal Brexit figure, Nigel Farage, welcomed Trump's executive order. \"He was elected to get tough. He was elected to say he would do everything in his power to protect America from infiltration by ISIS terrorists. There are seven countries on that list. He is entitled to do this. He was voted in on this,\" Farage told the BBC.\n\nOther far-right leaders in Europe also said they agreed with the ban.\n\nNo more immigration from any Islamic country is exactly what we need.Also in The NetherlandsFor islam and freedom are incompatible.\u2014 Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) January 29, 2017\n\n\"No more immigration from any Islamic country is exactly what we need,\" said Dutch far-right Party for Freedom founder and leader Geert Wilders on Twitter. \"Also in The Netherlands Islam and freedom are incompatible.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.392157077789309, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 749, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 15, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.833316535619999, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 17, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 64, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170130110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 8.54472630173565, "mft_mean": 5.818181818180001}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/01/politics/keith-ellison-anti-defamation-league-middle-east/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 621, "scraper_regex": 663}}, "headline": "Keith Ellison defends comments about Middle East in open letter to ADL", "wordcount_as_scraped": 663, "date": "20161202080000", "story_content": "Rep. Keith Ellison, a leading contender to be the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee, wrote an open letter to the Anti-Defamation League over past comments he made about American policy in the Middle East that the group says are \"disqualifying.\"\n\nThe first Muslim elected to Congress responded to a statement issued by ADL's CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who this week in a statement condemned a 2010 Ellison speech implying US policy in the region favored Israel at the expense of Muslim-majority countries -- \"that U.S. foreign policy is based on religiously or national origin-based special interests rather than simply on America's best interests.\"\n\n\"In a speech recorded in 2010 to a group of supporters, Rep. Ellison is heard suggesting that American foreign policy in the Middle East is driven by Israel, saying: 'The United States foreign policy in the Middle East is governed by what is good or bad through a country of 7 million people. A region of 350 million all turns on a country of 7 million. Does that make sense? Is that logic? Right? When the Americans who trace their roots back to those 350 million get involved, everything changes,'\" the statement read. \n\nGreenblatt continued, \"Rep. Ellison's remarks are both deeply disturbing and disqualifying.\"\n\nRep. Keith Ellison faces renewed scrutiny over past ties to Nation of Islam, defense of anti-Semitic figures\n\nIn Ellison's open letter to the ADL, he said his 2010 comments were \"selectively edited and taken out of context by an individual the Southern Poverty Law Center has called an 'anti-Muslim extremist.'\"\n\n\"I wish we could have spoken once again before your most recent statement. If given the opportunity, I could have provided a full and proper explanation,\" Ellison wrote in the letter. \"My memory is that I was responding to a question about how Americans with roots in the Middle East could engage in the political process in a more effective way. My advice was simply to get involved. I believe that Israel and the U.S.-Israel relationship are, and should be, key considerations in shaping U.S. policy in the Middle East.\" \n\nEllison, who said he was \"saddened\" by the ADL statement, added that he wanted to meet soon with Greenblatt \"to discuss our shared beliefs and commitment to fairness and justice,\" and said he was \"committed to building a strong relationship with you.\" \n\nEllison added that he thought the comments were being surfaced by unnamed \"right-wing interests to drive a wedge between long-standing allies in the fight for equal rights.\"\n\n\"My record proves my deep and long-lasting support for Israel, and I have always fought anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, and homophobia - the same values embodied by the Anti-Defamation League.\"\n\nEllison is also facing criticism for past ties to the Nation of Islam and his defense of its anti-Semitic leader, Louis Farrakhan -- which are resurfacing as he campaigns to lead the DNC.\n\nCNN's KFile reviewed Ellison's past writings and public statements during the late 1980s through the 1990s, which revealed his decade-long involvement in the Nation of Islam. However, none of the records reviewed found examples of Ellison making any anti-Semitic comments himself, and Ellison disavowed his early comments in 2006 after it became an issue during his run for Congress.\n\nIn his 2006 comments, Ellison wrote he had seen the Nation of Islam and the Million Man March as positive efforts to promote responsibility and economic development in the black community -- but added that he had failed to scrutinize the views of Farrakhan and Khalid Abdul Muhammad and wrongly dismissed concerns they were anti-Semitic.\n\nThe American Jewish World endorsed Ellison in 2006, saying they were \"convinced that Ellison has had a real change of heart and mind.\"\n\nAnd speaking to a synagogue in 2006, Ellison said he was confronting a past he wasn't proud of.\n\n\"I wasn't proud of my work with the Nation of Islam,\" Ellison said at the time, \"but I was hoping it wouldn't come up.

The chaos prevented some shoppers from grabbing clothes off clearance racks and returning gifts. \n\nThe mall incidents, which ranged from minor melees to mass evacuations, occurred from Colorado to Tennessee and Texas to New Jersey. \n\nPolice in some cities are investigating the role social media may have played in organizing the disturbances. The motive behind the mall brawls is not yet known. \n\nHere's what happened at nine of those malls.  \n\nAurora, Colorado\n\nIt all started with a social media post that promised a fight at the Town Center at Aurora.\n\nAurora Police Department spokesman Sgt. Chris Amsler said about 100 people had gathered in the food court before the brawls broke out -- prompting the Colorado mall to close early on Monday afternoon..\n\n\"(It) kind of morphed into this large disturbance,\" Amsler said.\n\nWhen off-duty police officers working as security guards tried to break up a fight, people circled the officers, who called for backup, Amsler said. \n\nAs police officers on duty arrived, fights broke out throughout the mall, at a movie theater and at a nearby park-and-ride lot, he said.\n\nThe mall is closing early this evening due to a disturbance.

Authorities arrested five people, all juveniles, and recovered no weapons, he said. One person assaulted at the park-and-ride lot suffered \"significant\" injuries and was taken to a hospital, Amsler said.\n\nAurora, Illinois\n\nIn Aurora, Illinois, eight juveniles, ranging in age from 13 to 17, have been charged in connection with the large disturbances at Fox Valley Mall, police said in a statement released Tuesday.  The teens were taking into custody Monday evening after police received a call for assistance at the shopping center\"due to an unruly crowd in the common area,\" police said. \n\n\"All of the charges lodged are misdemeanors, however, police are not ruling out enhancing them to felonies,\" the statement said. More arrests are possible, police said. \n\nMoments after the call, a fight broke out in the food court area and those were followed by several other smaller altercations, the Aurora police said. \n\nThe brawl forced evacuations and the mall closed. No injuries were reported in the incident.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee\n\nIn Memphis, seven people were arrested after incidents at two malls, CNN affiliate WMC reported. \n\nPolice said a group started a disturbance in the Wolfchase Galleria food court and started running, which prompted some customers to call 911, WMC said. \n\nThen a crowd gathered outside Oak Court Mall, about 10 miles west, and started a disturbance, WMC said. Both malls were cleared and closed early for the night.\n\nShots were reported in both incidents, but police said they found no evidence of gunfire, WMC said.\n\nNo injuries were reported, CNN affiliate WATN said.\n\nChattanooga, Tennessee\n\nLoud sounds kicked off a wave of panic at Hamilton Place Mall, in Chattanooga, Tennessee. \n\nSeveral people were pushed to the ground as shoppers rushed to exit the mall, police said.   \n\nOfficers rushed to the scene after receiving reports of \"shots fired,\" but the sounds turned out to be fireworks.\n\nUPDATE: 20 firecrackers were discharged in Pink causing confusion. 3 injuries are reported, 0 serious.\u00a0Mall is returning to normal operation\u2014 Hamilton Place (@HamiltonPlaceTN) December 26, 2016\n\n\"Our investigation concluded that it was perpetrated a group of individuals who were setting off fireworks, possibly to coverup the actions of a shoplifting crime,\" the Chattanooga Police Department said in a statement. \n\nMinor injuries were reported after the incident. \n\nPolice have descriptions of the suspects involved in this incident and video footage, the statement said.  \n\nFayetteville, North Carolina\n\nIn Fayetteville, North Carolina, people panicked after teenagers fought in the food court, Fayetteville police spokesman Shawn Strepay  told CNN affiliate WRAL. No shots were fired, despite reports of gunfire, Strepay said.\n\n\"Once people start running in that area or chairs are getting knocked over, tables, that sort of thing, that echoes and it could resemble the sound of a gunshot to a lot of people,\" he said.\n\nRef Cross Creek Mall.

Witnesses said  they thought they had heard shots fired. That, along with a fight, led to what Elizabeth police Officer Greg Jones described as a \"chaotic panic and everybody running all at once.\" \n\nUltimately, though, patrons had mistaken the sound of a chair slammed during a fight for gunfire, city officials told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey. Two people, an 8-year-old and 12-year-old, were injured, the station reported.\n\nManchester, Connecticut \n\nAmateur video taken from inside Buckland Hills Mall, in Manchester, Connecticut, shows people screaming as punches were being thrown inside the shops on the day after Christmas.\n\n\"It was estimated that there were several hundred teenagers inside the mall and several other fights broke out around the same time,\" the Manchester Police Department said in a statement. \n\nNo weapons were involved, but one Manchester police officer was assaulted while trying to break up a first fight, police said. The officer did not sustain any significant injuries. \n\nFort Worth, Texas\n\nThe security guards had no other choice but to place the Hulen Mall on lockdown. At one point, police told CNN affiliate KTVT, at least 100 people were involved in a series of fights.\n\nFort Worth Police spokeswoman Tamara Velle said officers initially responded to reported gunfire inside the mall. After breaking up the fights, officers stopped by each store to let people leave while the lockdown remained in effect, KTVT reported.\n\nhulen mall wild for this one lmao pic.twitter.com/4rD4ZO5h1H\u2014 cyn \ud83d\udc98 (@CyNinja) December 27, 2016\n\nThere were no reported injures or property damage -- thanks in large part to local police, Kelle said.\n\n\"You keep hearing the horror stories of the mall shootings across the nations right now,\" Velle told KTVT. \"Anytime we're hearing about a mall shooting and it's the day after Christmas, (where) you have tons of people holiday shopping ... we're going to get in there as fast as we can.\"\n\nBeachwood, Ohio \n\nShortly after sunset, a large-scale disturbance broke out at Beachwood Place Mall, in Beachwood, Ohio. \n\nAn initial report of gunfire was quickly found to be false by police.  \n\n\"One male juvenile was arrested for attempting to strike an officer that was dealing with another disorderly patron,\" Beachwood police said in a statement. \n\nBeachwood police, officers from nearby jurisdictions and mall security were able to disperse the juveniles and remove them from the mall, police said in a statement. Beachwood Police Capt. Gary Haba told CNN that pepper spray was used to disperse a large crowd at one point.\n\nThe disturbance appears \"to have been loosely organized on social media,\" the statement said. \n\nBeachwood mall was re-opened and there were no injuries or other arrests.

I can't take credit for that insanely perfect word to describe this precarious time -- that goes to feminist writer and critic Roxane Gay.\n\nI love the word because it captures the suspicion women have for one another in light of Donald Trump's election.  That sense of betrayal Clinton supporters now feel; that sense of \"girl, you just don't get it\" among Trump supporters. \n\n More than one woman told me they fear their rights are about to slip away. It is certainly why Gay feels ... fraught. \"I think we are waiting to see what's going to happen next, and how,\" she told me. \"Who the new President-elect is going to appoint to the Supreme Court, to see how quickly Roe vs. Wade is going to be overturned, and then how we respond to that.\"\n\nAccording to Pew Research, seven in 10 Americans do not want Roe vs Wade overturned; but will women, in the name of sisterhood, protest en masse against any attempt at a rollback of their rights? \n\nIn the era of a Donald Trump presidency, I think it's safe to say: Who knows?\n\nWhat woman striving for equality would vote for a man who judges women based on their body parts and brags about sexual assault? Yet, a majority of white women voted for Trump -- just as many Democratic women continued to support Bill Clinton after he took advantage of a White House intern.  \n\nI have to conclude  -- and I know I'm generalizing -- that women are either OK with that kind of behavior or we've put up with it for so long we've become numb to it.  \n\n\"I thought she [Clinton] was an exceptional candidate,\" Gay told me. \"But that 53% of white women, in particular, supported [Trump], was surprising until I remembered that in general, I think, white women were more invested in protecting their whiteness than their womanhood.\" \n\nClearly, Gay is cynical in post-Trumpian America. But not all the women I spoke with were as pessimistic. \n\nFormer Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson believes women will ultimately fight for one another, even after she initially discovered dismal female support in the wake of filing a sexual harassment suit against Roger Ailes. \n\n\"I think a lot of women don't think we're all on the same page,\" Carlson told me. She says Trump won over so many women because their concerns over policy \"superseded some of the basic tenets in the way we treat one another.\"\n\nBut, she says, that doesn't mean sisterhood is on life support. Carlson intends to make sure it thrives. \"Trump has said he loves women, and believes in women,\" she said. \"I challenge him to then put women in high-ranking positions, show America that your words are true.\"\n\nSo far, Trump's \"big four\" Cabinet picks -- secretary of state, secretary of defense, attorney general and secretary of the treasury -- are white men. The less powerful positions were offered to women. \n\nStill, Nancy Brinker, who founded the Susan G. Komen Foundation and its Race for the Cure, is encouraged by Trump's early moves. She told me, \"It's too early to judge.\"\n\nShe said many women were able to dismiss Trump's misogynist comments because some found his rhetoric \"strong and hopeful.\" \"Make America great,\" she said, is \"a strong, good statement.\"  \n\nBrinker also laments, \"We still don't have very many women global CEOs\" or female \"corporate board members.\" Although she supports Trump, she plans to continue her fight for equality.\n\nThat kind of logic is confounding to women like Gay, who embrace their identity as feminists. Although, perhaps that word, feminist, also represents part of the reason the state of sisterhood is so fraught. \n\nNashville singer songwriter, Ayla Brown, who sang the national anthem at the Republican National Convention, told me, \"I don't consider myself a [feminist]. I consider myself someone who works incredibly hard.\" Gender, she said, \"does not matter.\" \n\nIbtihaj Muhammad, a trailblazing bronze Olympic medalist fencer and Hillary Clinton supporter who became the first Muslim-American woman to wear a hijab while competing for the United States, rejects the word.\n\n\"Feminism can mean so many things depending on who you're asking,\" she told me. Yet, in that same interview, she added, \"Myself, as a minority, even as a woman, you almost have to work twice as hard to receive the same things that you know your counterparts receive.\"\n\nSo how do we, as women, protect our hard-fought gains if we are out of sync over a word -- a movement -- that won us so many rights? The thought makes Gay crazy because so many women who disavow the label are feminist. \"I don't want to be sexually harassed at work, but I'm not a feminist,\" she said, rolling her eyes. \"Like, girl, what? Like, just get a dictionary.\"\n\nOr a platform. \n\nThat's exactly what hundreds of thousands of women will do this coming Saturday. They will gather on the National Mall to send a message to President Trump. We're here. We're watching you. And we're ready to fight back.\n\nReshma Saujani, CEO of Girls Who Code, is psyched for what comes next. \"I think it has lit a fire under us,\" she told me. \"I think what you are going to see over the next four to eight years is more women saying, enough. I want affordable day care, I want paid leave. I think you're going to see more activism, you're going to see more women running for office, you're going to see more women take more risks, starting companies.\"  \n\nAnd, even at this anxiety-riddled time in history, isn't that the kind of sisterhood all women can support?

Tinsel Christmas trees and golden stars hang from lampposts along Main Street in downtown Roxboro, North Carolina (population 8,632, according to the 2010 census).\n\nIts short parade of shops are mostly shut. The street is deserted, apart from two car repossession men watching a parked SUV for its owner to return.\n\nThen it happens.\n\nA pickup turns left into the street, followed by 30 more vehicles in a parade of honking horns. It's hard to tell exactly how many people are in the cars. Some fly the Southern Cross -- once a symbol of the Confederacy during the Civil War; today seen by many as a badge of the racist right. Other flags are labeled with a white cross on a red background, a symbol of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAs they pass, two men in black shirts lean from their windows and extend an arm into the air, raising their palms in a Nazi salute.\n\nThis motorcade, passing in front of me in an empty shopping street on a Saturday afternoon, are the terrible dark forces unleashed by Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nHe won, in part, through his promise to say the unsayable: Mexicans are rapists and drug smugglers; Muslims are terrorists unless they can prove otherwise; African-Americans live in ghettos.\n\nIn the privacy of the voting booth, enough people agreed with his worldview that Trump will become the 45th president of the United States of America on January 20.\n\nSince then, such private sentiments have become public. There was the Muslim woman allegedly attacked by three drunk men in New York last week as they tried to remove her hijab. \n\nThe dozens, if not hundreds, of reports of children being bullied at school in connection with their religion or ethnicity. And the rash of swastikas daubed on buildings across the country.\n\nIt is easy to see why. White supremacists agree with Trump. He may have condemned the KKK, but they voted for him and his brand of American exceptionalism.\n\nSaturday's parade -- a Kavalcade, the Klan calls it -- was a victory rally.\n\nAmanda Barker, Imperial Kommander, told me as much when we met on her front porch earlier in the day. She had spent the preceding days stitching blue and gold ribbons for participants to add to their Klan robes during a cross-burning ceremony to be held that evening -- if the day's high winds died down to a safe level. Even white nationalists have health and safety codes.\n\nCold weather, she explained, meant that the victory parade would be held in cars rather than on foot. Klansmen, apparently, are a delicate bunch.\n\nNot so much Barker, who told me all this dressed only in pajama bottoms and a T-shirt as she stood barefoot on the concrete porch. It had been a late night and she had just woken.\n\nThe truth emerged at the end of the day in a press release from the sheriff's office. Her late night was the result of a fight among Klansmen, who met at her home to  plan the parade.  Her husband, an Imperial Wizard of the Loyal White Knights, ended up with stab wounds, and another man was arrested.\n\nIt turned the parade into a day of confusion. The spokesman -- or Exalted Cyclops -- told reporters the Kavalcade was canceled, and he missed it himself.\n\nBut eventually it rumbled up Main Street in front of a handful of bemused pedestrians.\n\nThis is where we are now. \n\nOf course, not all of the millions who voted for Trump are white supremacists. The thugs of the KKK may feel emboldened, but we need not fear them. They remain a ridiculous conceit, a dressing-up club exposed as a thuggish shambles.\n\nWhen you see them up close, it's hard to imagine there will be a KKK revival under Trump.\n\nAnd there is a wider lesson as we agonize over how best to avoid normalizing those white supremacists and Internet trolls who have coalesced into the \"alt-right.\"\n\nThey may have replaced the hoods with the faceless anonymity of the Internet. They may look big and tough in the echo chamber of social media. They may have Steven Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, in the White House come January.\n\nThey may very well feel emboldened, but that doesn't make them any more real. That doesn't make them a representative point of view.\n\nNormalizing them does not mean accepting the rebranded, suited look or the euphemistic title. The danger is in treating them as if they matter, as if they are anything other than a fringe movement and troll army. The danger is in putting them on TV and in newspapers to talk about immigration or terrorism.\n\nThe Klansmen I saw paraded before a largely deserted street. Their raw message of hatred attracted barely any support. In the daylight they looked simply ridiculous with their black shirts and Cub Scout-style patches.\n\nSo too did members of the alt-right when they were exposed at a Washington conference last month giving the Nazi salute, alienating many observers and sabotaging their chances of influencing the mainstream.\n\nNone of this is an argument for complacency. Nor is it a call to underestimate the very horrible spate of hate attacks around the country. But if I learned anything from my weekend following the KKK around North Carolina, is that their toxic message is as feeble as it is frightening.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.7228541374206503, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 906, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.8982375470700001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161207160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.2075055187637997, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/barack-obama-farewell-speech/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 952, "scraper_regex": 1032}}, "headline": "Barack Obama's nostalgic goodbye", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1032, "date": "20170111040000", "story_content": "Eight years ago, Barack Obama inspired Americans to embrace political change with the mantra \"yes we can.\" He bade them farewell Tuesday after a historic, tumultuous presidency with the words \"yes we did.\"\n\nObama revived the spirit and idealism of his 2008 campaign in a nostalgic, sometimes emotional final address to the nation from his hometown of Chicago, 10 days before he cedes power to Donald Trump, his antithesis in personality and politics.\n\nThe President stood unbowed and unapologetic after eight tough years, an unrepentant champion of hope and change.\n\nJust as on a frigid morning in Springfield, Illinois, in February 2007 when he announced his White House bid, Obama strode on a walkway to a stage set in a huge crowd to his campaign anthem, \"City of Blinding Lights\" by U2.\n\nDespite years of partisan gridlock, tarnished hopes that the nation's first African-American president could represent a post-racial age, and the uncertainty of leaving his legacy in the hands of Republicans bent on destroying it, Obama defiantly defended his belief in the capacity of politics to empower transformational social and economic change.\n\nPresident Obama farewell address: full text\n\n\"If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history...,\" Obama said.\n\n He continued:\n\n\"If I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, and take out the mastermind of 9/11... If I had told you that we would win marriage equality, and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens -- you might have said our sights were set a little too high.\" \n\n\"But that's what we did,\" Obama said. \"That's what you did. You were the change. You answered people's hopes. And because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.\"\n\nA speech for history\n\nIn a speech that was as much for history as for the moment, Obama essentially argued that America is as great as it has ever been, a beacon of democracy, equality and hope. That was a not-too-subtle contrast to President-elect Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan.\n\nIn many ways, Obama's speech was a repudiation of those who said he raised unreasonable expectations with his hope-fueled campaign in 2008 and failed to change the tone of politics as he had promised.\n\nHe argued passionately for progressive change, economic and gender equality, a strong social safety net, a health care system like the one set up under his Affordable Care Act, and a tax code that does not overtly benefit the rich.\n\nWhile its purpose was to say goodbye, Obama's speech also felt more like the kind of campaign address he might deliver today, were he running for the White House for the first time. He spoke with the passion of a candidate, not a bowed lame duck president shuffling off into retirement.\n\nHe spoke of threats to America's political system, at a time of dislocation and turmoil across the world, beseeching his supporters not to cede the fight to improve and safeguard their democracy, sounding as though he was worried about what might happen once he has left the White House.\n\nWhile touting his achievements, he painted a picture of a nation tested by racial, economic and social strains, and in comments that appeared to be a reflection on the fury and division opened by the election in which Trump beat Hillary Clinton last year.\n\n\"There have been moments throughout our history that threatened to rupture that solidarity. The beginning of this century has been one of those times,\" Obama said. \"A shrinking world, growing inequality; demographic change and the specter of terrorism --- these forces haven't just tested our security and prosperity, but our democracy as well.\" \n\nDeparture from tradition\n\nObama's address was a departure from the more traditional farewell speeches given by past presidents \u2014 it could hardly have been more different than the cozy, humble speech by President Ronald Reagan in 1989.\n\nIndeed, the grandiosity and highly political tone of the event will likely irk Republicans who argue that Obama opened political divides rather than healing them as he promised in 2008.\n\nThe speech was also a reminder of the stylistic differences between the 44th President and the 45th President who will be sworn in next week -- and the sharp divides in the nation which they represent.\n\nWhere Trump prefers social media bursts and stream of consciousness tirades, Obama's speech was an illustration of what his supporters see as soaring eloquence, and critics brand as professorial lecturing.\n\nThe President only mentioned Trump in recalling his promise to the President-elect to preside over a smooth transfer of power. But much of his comments -- and defense of his own record -- could be taken as an implicit criticism of the man who will replace him in the Oval Office.\n\nHe decried the \"selective sorting of the facts\" that he said plagued modern politics, rejected discrimination against Muslim Americans, lambasted those who deny global warming is real and said \"democracy can buckle when we give in to fear.\"\n\n\"Without some common baseline of facts; without a willingness to admit new information, and concede that your opponent is making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, we'll keep talking past each other, making common ground and compromise impossible,\" Obama said.\n\nObama became emotional when he paid tribute to his wife Michelle and his daughters Malia and Sasha\n\n\"You took on a role you didn't ask for and made it your own with grace and grit and style and good humor,\" he told the First Lady. \n\nComing full circle, Obama took his leave by recalling his 2007 campaign launching address -- effectively arguing that everything he had said that day about being a catalyst for Americans to realize their own political change had been validated over the course of his presidency.\n\n\"You did change the world,\" he said.\n\n\"I am asking you to believe,\" he continued. \"Not in my ability to bring about change -- but in yours.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.25361621379852, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 952, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.39177420112, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.04621848739496, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/opinions/lets-help-syrian-refugees-warmflash-opinion/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 878, "scraper_regex": 931}}, "headline": "Why Donald Trump is wrong about Syrian refugees", "wordcount_as_scraped": 931, "date": "20170127010000", "story_content": "Becoming a mother changed my life in many ways, but one of the most profound and unexpected consequences is that I became unable to watch children suffer without putting my own kids in their shoes. How would I comfort my daughter if she had to go days without adequate food? How could I ever make her feel safe if our house was destroyed by war?\n\n \n\nLike so many around the world, I was haunted by those images of Syrian toddlers washed up on the shores of Turkey and little boys stunned into silence by violence in Aleppo, unable even to cry. What if that were my son? \n\nWhat good would the world's sympathy do, if no one would act to help him? Or worse, what if his suffering persisted because people who had the power to help him perceived him as a threat to their safety?\n\nFeeling sorry wasn't enough for me anymore. I needed to take action. I decided to get involved in my own community supporting Syrian refugee families in whatever way I could. \n\n \n\nI contacted my rabbi to see if we might organize our synagogue community to help. He told me  he had already reached out to Church World Service, an agency that aids in the resettlement of refugees from around the world.  We could co-sponsor a refugee family with CWS and help them adjust to life in America. \n\nA few weeks later I was at the airport with three other members of my Jewish community, waiting to welcome a refugee family to their new home in New Jersey (They have asked that we not use their names for fear of retribution against family members still in Syria). After 20 hours in transit and four hours of processing in immigration, the refugees walked down the long ramp from the immigration office at Newark airport. While they speak almost no English and were understandably exhausted and nervous, their hope and optimism were unmistakable.\n\n \n\nIt is hard to believe this family has been in New Jersey only a week. The two youngest daughters have already registered for school and will start attending class in just a few weeks. The father, mother, and older child are applying for jobs. They have started taking English classes. They have been shopping at Target and Old Navy.  \n\nPresident Trump said he will sign an executive order on Wednesday that will ban Syrian refugees from entering the United States.\n\nHe is not banning people looking to harm us. He is keeping out people -- like the family I have come to know -- who just want to live normal, American lives. \n\nThey haven't spoken much about their lives before they arrived in America: their flight from Syria to Turkey and the conditions of their lives there while they waited to hear news of their resettlement. I hope one day they will feel safe enough to share their transit story with me. But I am sure that their routine now is a far cry from their lives before they arrived here.\n\nOf course, not everything has gone smoothly. When one of my fellow committee members showed up with the family and all their necessary documentation at the Social Security office, after hours of waiting they were turned away. As new arrivals, their information hadn't yet been processed by immigration and the Social Security office did not have the necessary data to process their application. There was nothing the volunteer or family could do. They will have to try again.\n\nAnd there are cultural adjustments that have been hard to navigate on both sides. The day after the family arrived, their caseworker from CWS visited to check on them and to distribute a small amount of pocket money to tide them over until their food stamps and cash assistance kicks in. She handed one envelope to the father and one to the mother. The mother immediately handed her envelope of cash to her husband. Their interpreter explained to them that in this country men and women are equals. \n\nThis family has made an enormous impact on me and my husband and children. They are a loving, smart and resilient family, and my life is better for having met them. Being with them as the reality of their newfound freedom sinks in has made me love and appreciate my country more than I ever have. They are eager to get on their feet and contribute and I have no doubt that their contributions will make our nation stronger.  And they have a 6-year-old daughter, just like me. \n\nPresident Trump has said his refugee ban is necessary to protect our country, and his executive order reads, \"We must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward our country and its founding principles.\" \n\nIn addition to suspending the admission of refugees, he wants to cut in half the total number who could be admitted. \n\nIt's easy to get lost in the global scope of the refugee crisis and the tough language of our new President's insistence that we need tighter vetting. It's too easy to forget the human reality of what it's like to be -- or to welcome -- a family seeking solace and a new life. \n\nOne thing I know is this family is so grateful to be here. When my husband met them for the first time, just a few days after they arrived here, he asked them how they are adjusting. \"We love America,\" they said. Whenever we see them, every meeting starts and ends with kisses on each cheek and the words \"thank you.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 22, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.6335797309875489, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 878, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.18048113883, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 47, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.35307517084282, "mft_mean": 4.27272727273}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/13/opinions/suburban-voting-bloc-opinion-levy/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Suburban voters make a president, and they can break him, too", "wordcount_as_scraped": 935, "date": "20161214000000", "story_content": "Once again, as they have almost every four years since they became the dominant voting bloc, the \"swinging\" suburbs picked the winner of a US presidential election. \n\nBut if suburbanites hold the keys to the White House, as well as control of Congress, these independent-minded voters also offer a doorway to winning after the election. If the President-elect and leaders of both major parties want to build coalitions for legislation, they will look to the centrist sensibilities of suburbanites for policy compromises that might isolate partisans on the far right and left. \n\nNeither predictably \"blue\" like Democratic city voters nor reliably \"red\" as their rural counterparts, suburbanites have migrated to the \"purple\" middle of American politics. And the winning national candidates are usually the ones who build a bridge to the 'burbs from their city or country bases.\n\nThis year, enough suburbanites leaned right toward their rural counterparts -- especially in a handful of the most competitive swing states -- to give the Republicans the presidency and continued control of Congress.\n\nThat wasn't widely expected. Many suburbs are becoming more diverse demographically and politically, with a surge of new immigrants and other minorities turning these places from red to purple, if not blue -- and doing so in local and state elections, as well as national. These places should not have been hospitable to Trump. And during the primaries, they weren't: Trump did relatively poorly in suburbs against his Republican opponents, even in states he won. \n\nAs expected, Clinton crushed Trump in many so-called \"inner ring\" suburbs in most of the competitive states. The suburbs immediately outside Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, went strongly for Clinton. The suburbs outside Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, also supported Clinton, along with those outside Denver and Las Vegas.\n\nEven in two of the three arguably blue states that ultimately cost Clinton the election,  Pennsylvania and Michigan, she performed as well as Obama did in most of the suburbs that ringed major cities. In Oakland County, a prosperous, GOP-leaning suburb of Detroit, Clinton maintained an eight-point edge. The \"big four\" suburban counties contiguous to deep blue Philadelphia provided Clinton with a collective margin of nearly 200,000 votes, more than enough to win that coveted state in a \"normal\" year. \n\nBut this wasn't a normal year. \n\nAccording to exit polls, Trump took the suburbs nationally by 5 points. Even if that number should shrink as Clinton's lead in the popular vote expands, the margin is likely to be more than any presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush. \n\nTrump did it by playing tactical hopscotch. His campaign skipped many of the near-in suburbs that lean more Democratic and focused heavily on \"outer-ring\" suburbs and rural-suburban places called \"exurbs.\" He went after both wealthier lifelong \"McMansion Republicans\" and looked for the Trump version of \"Reagan Democrats\" in relatively poorer enclaves -- a number of whom had supported Obama and Bill Clinton. However hard she may, or may not, have tried, Hillary Clinton couldn't pry away the GOP loyalists or retain the blue-collar Democrats.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, where Clinton dominated Philadelphia and its inner suburbs, the story was different in the next rings out. Take Berks County, where Obama lost in 2012 by 1 point: Trump won by 10. In the exurb of Carbon County, where Obama lost by 6, Clinton was buried by 24. In Luzerne, which Obama carried by 5 points, Trump won by 20. \n\nIf Clinton had managed to hold onto outer suburbs that Obama won or had done nearly as well in losing them, it's likely she would be president-elect, regardless of the surge of voters in small rural towns. \n\nBut now that the campaign and number-crunching is over, another arguably more important campaign has begun. And that is the one to move the country forward by governing. \n\nThe lesson in these numbers is that if leaders don't heed suburbanites, they could pay a price politically and miss an opportunity for sound policy. \n\nAlmost every one of the approximately 40 congressional seats identified by both parties as competitive this year were wholly or substantially suburban. They're filled with moderates who \"vote the person, not party\" -- but who will and do punish those who let them down with partisan or ideological lurches from the mainstream. The whipping that the Democrats took in 2010, when they lost control of Congress, isn't the first time presidents and parties faced a quick backlash to voters' remorse.\n\nOn the policy front, mobilizing these swing suburban voters and their representatives could pay dividends in generating bipartisan coalitions to pass major legislation on transportation, health care, environmental protection and other issues that less-centrist politicians wouldn't approve because they \"went too far\" or \"not far enough.\" The same could be true in blocking controversial efforts such as rolling back abortion rights or workplace protections.\n\nIf Trump wants to retain the affection of the suburbanites who backed him -- and perhaps gain among those, particularly in swing states, who rejected him -- he will pay attention to what's going on in these communities. Many suburbs are facing the same problems of the cities from which people once fled to outer counties: rising crime and drug addiction, more failing schools, crumbling infrastructure and inadequate health care for a growing portion of the population.\n\nYet, unlike cities in particular, suburbs are often a mishmash of small governments that may have been charmingly quaint a generation ago but are spectacularly unprepared -- fiscally, professionally and politically -- to deal with these complex and expensive problems.\n\nIn short, Trump and Congress need to disabuse themselves of the myths of suburban wealth and wellness that mistakenly make them a lesser priority for policymakers.

Turkish authorities said they believe he carried out the attack alone.\n\nEarlier Monday, the militant Kurdistan Worker's Party, or PKK, distanced itself from the attack. \n\n\"No Kurdish forces have anything to do with this attack,\" the PKK said. \"The Kurdish freedom fight is also the fight for democratization of Turkey. That's why we won't target innocent and civilian people.\"\n\nThe victims\n\nThose killed in the attack were from 14 countries, including India, Morocco, Jordan, Canada, Russia, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\n\nSecurity guard Fatih Cakmak was one of the first victims killed. He had considered himself lucky after surviving a December attack outside Istanbul's Vodafone Arena, where he was also working security.  \n\n\"He went to work, and now he's gone,\" said his father, Hassan Cakmak, who said he can't believe he survived his 32-year-old son.\n\nLubna Ghaznawi, a young female entrepreneur from Saudi Arabia, was also killed. The 34-year-old worked full-time as a communications manager for one of Saudi Arabia's largest banks and also co-owned a start-up with her sister called Exclusave Card, the first student discount card in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"She was an optimist and loved going to new places,\" her friend Seham al-Shahrani told CNN. \"Laughter and happiness filled whatever place she went to.\" \n\nDozens of people were hospitalized. As of Monday, 46 were still being treated, including one American, according to the Istanbul governor's office. A handful of the injured were in critical condition.\n\n'We were having fun'\n\nWitnesses described how the festive evening turned into a bloodbath.\n\n\"We were having fun. At first we thought it was a fight, then there was a lot of gunfire,\" witness Yunus Turk told CNN.\n\n\"After the gunfire everyone started to run toward the terrace. We ran as well. There was someone next to me who was shot and fell on the floor. We ran away and hid under the sofas.\" \n\nREAD: International community mourns Turkey attack victims\n\nAnother witness said he didn't know how many attackers there were, but he saw one person and hid. \n\n\"I got shot in the f****** leg, man,\" he told journalists as he was taken into an ambulance. \"These crazy people came in shooting everything.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the club issued a statement on its Facebook page.\n\n\"This terrible incident is a terror attack against our citizens' peace, brotherhood, serenity, economy, tourism and against our nation,\" the statement read. \n\n\"Our hearts bleed and the bullets are in our heart.\" \n\nWhy Turkey keeps getting targeted\n\nTurkey's deputy prime minister said he believes the attack was committed in response to Operation Euphrates Shield, Turkey's ground operation against ISIS in Syria. \n\nBut the country is \"fighting a two-front war -- against the Kurdish Workers' Party, and against the Islamic State,\" CNN intelligence and security analyst Bob Baer said. \n\nTurkey shares a 500-mile (800-kilometer) border with Syria, making it relatively easy for ISIS fighters and supplies to cross. \n\n\"That border is so porous -- weapons, explosives, people coming across it,\" Baer said. \n\nBoth ISIS and Kurdish militants have launched attacks in Turkey, which is also reeling from a bloody and failed military coup in July.\n\nOfficials suspect ISIS was responsible for the attack on Ataturk Airport in June that left 44 people dead and an explosion at an August wedding that killed at least 54 people.\n\nISIS has typically refrained from claiming responsibility for attacks in Turkey to create \"an environment of suspicion in Turkish politics,\" analyst Soner Cagaptay wrote for CNN last year.  \n\nSo ISIS' claim of responsibility for Sunday's nightclub attack could mark a turning point. \n\n\"I think with Istanbul, it's a declaration of war on Turkey,\" Baer said. \n\nMeanwhile, Turkish security forces clash almost daily with rebel PKK militants, mostly in predominantly Kurdish parts of southeastern Turkey.\n\nIn December, a pair of bombings in Istanbul killed 44 people and wounded 155 others in an attack by a breakaway group of the PKK. The two explosions occurred after a heavily attended soccer game at Besiktas Vodafone Arena.\n\nAlso in December, a car bomb exploded near a public bus, killing 13 soldiers in the central province of Kayseri. Three days later, a gunman assassinated Russia's ambassador to Turkey at an Ankara art gallery. \n\n'The issue of a copycat'\n\nSo how could the attack at the Reina nightclub have implications elsewhere? \n\nSince the assailant used a gun, and apparently started by killing the security guard, a similar attack could happen anywhere, CNN senior law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes said. \n\n\"You have the issue of a copycat,\" he said. \"So here in the United States,  we have over 300 million guns at large in our population.

They may also work to constantly fix others problems directly or indirectly, much like a professional therapist, but without the training, especially with regards to helping but without taking on the pain of others,\" she said. \"If you are the person who goes to bed at night with others' problems or acutely feels the pain of those around you, it may be a problem.\"\n\nThe good, the bad, and the toxic\n\nOn the other hand, toxic handlers can play a valuable and fulfilling role in both personal and professional relationships, Robinson said.\n\nIn their Harvard Business Review article, Robinson and co-author Kira Schabram of the University of Washington examined how toxic handlers can play an important role in the workplace.\n\n\"Toxic handlers absorb the negativity in day-to-day professional life and allow employees to focus on constructive work,\" Robinson and Schabram wrote.\n\nIn other words, toxic handlers -- sometimes called \"toxin handlers\" -- \"serve as a shield for some of the negative emotions of the workplace, keeping dysfunction and upset from affecting their coworkers, often the coworkers below them,\" said Andrea Bonior, a licensed clinical psychologist and adjunct professor at Georgetown University, who was not involved in the article.\n\nHowever, for a toxic handler, taking on the stress of others can have negative consequences too -- especially if the toxic handler is experiencing toxic venting.\n\nJudith Acosta, a psychotherapist based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, had a friend a few years ago who constantly vented about his boss and his work -- and he suddenly quit his job. She described him as a toxic venter.\n\nThough Acosta said that she never chastised her friend for his decision, when she asked about how he planned to support himself moving forward, he became defensive and irate. One telephone conversation ended abruptly when he hung up on her, and Acosta said she never heard from him again. \n\nThat was the end of their friendship.\n\n\"I wasn't saying what he wanted me to say, and I wasn't agreeing with what he wanted me to agree with,\" said Acosta, who wrote a blog post about this toxic venting experience in The Huffington Post in 2011. \n\nEven as a therapist, Acosta said, she didn't realize she was in the role of a toxic handler until she wrote about it.\n\n\"The full kind of awareness came as I was writing the article and putting it together and thinking, 'Oh, that's what that was,' \" she said.\n\n\"I love my friends, and I'm happy to be there for them, but there's something else with toxic venting that happens. It's the sensation of being used and of being inconsequential, except insofar as you contain their dumping,\" she said.\n\nAcosta said another friend in her life has the qualities of a toxic venter, but now Acosta focuses more so on her friend's other qualities.\n\n\"She's generous. She's thoughtful. Does she vent too much? Yeah, but you know, friendships are not perfect. I'm not perfect. She's not perfect,\" Acosta said. \"So you make accommodations for people like that.\"\n\nWhen you have a friend who brings nothing else to the table but toxic venting, Acosta added, that's when it might be time to re-evaluate the relationship.\n\nHow 'handling' may hurt your health\n\n\"Typically, when we take on others' stress, we are putting ourselves in situations where we have all the drawbacks of a problem -- fear, worry, stress -- without any way of actually doing something about it,\" Bonior said. \"We also are prone to feeling guilty or responsible for things that are not our fault or our duty to handle.\" \n\nThose negative feelings can interfere with your stress levels and, as a result, might impact your mental and physical health, she said. \n\nAlso, if you are a toxic handler, \"you may be so busy helping others that you aren't helping yourself or getting those others to be there for you, too,\" Robinson said.\n\nTherefore, experts suggest nourishing your personal and professional relationships while keeping toxic handling to a manageable level.\n\nAfter all, there are many health benefits associated with maintaining a social life. Numerous studies suggest that friendships can boost longevity and your immune system, and even reduce stress -- when toxic handling is done right.\n\n'These expectations are not real'\n\nStepping back from the toxic handler role actually did more good than bad for the relationships in Shelby Sever's life, she said.\n\nSever realized she put herself in a toxic handler role in her friendships during her last year as an undergraduate student at Oklahoma State University in 2014. Sever is currently a second-year graduate student of educational leadership studies at the university.\n\n\"I didn't feel like my friends appreciated all the things I did for them,\" said Sever, who wrote a blog about her experience as a toxic handler two years ago.\n\nShe said she was the friend who would have three-hour-long conversations to listen to someone else's problems, even if she didn't have the time. \n\nAfter taking a month to herself, during which she stopped communication with her friends, she eventually opened up and told them how she was feeling.\n\n\"When I told my friends, they said, 'Well, we don't know how to talk to you, because you never let us know how you're feeling,' \" she said. \"That's when I realized ... I was trying to feel important, and I really didn't need to enforce that. People valued me anyway, and they wanted to be my friend whether or not I took on their burdens.\"\n\nSince then, Sever said, she has started to say no to staying on the phone for hours and yes to taking care of her own well-being first. Now, she feels healthier and more confident in her relationships.\n\n\"I think the most important thing is understanding that these expectations are not real. ... I guess, understanding that the expectations you think others place on you are things that you put on yourself,\" Sever said. \n\n\"Now, my friends feel more valued in my life because I let them know who I am versus I just did things for them,\" she said. \"I'm still friends with all those people but it's so much better because we communicate on a more authentic level.\"\n\nHow to stop, without losing friends\n\nTo determine whether  you are toxic handler, consider how much of your time in a relationship is devoted to fixing problems; it shouldn't be all day and night, said Dr. Abigail Brenner, a San Francisco and New York-based psychiatrist and a fellow of the American Psychiatric Association.\n\n\"Nor should you feel that you need to take on the role of a therapist. Nor should you feel guilty if you aren't available to take care of people. Nor should you get physically or emotionally ill by assuming this role. Nor should you be taking on the role of a toxic handler in order to feel needed,\" Brenner said. \n\n\"A person who finds themselves in this role eventually needs to take a look at all of the dynamics, most especially their own, in ongoing relationships,\" she said.\n\nStepping away from the toxic handler role comes down to establishing boundaries, Bonior said.\n\n\"Put more faith in people. Help build them up and support them rather than absorbing their stress,\" she said, adding that it's important to let go of things that are not your problem.\n\nThough friendships involve supporting each other in times of need, a healthy friendship does not require that you damage your own well-being on a regular basis in return, Bonior said.\n\nAdditionally, \"look at how your own specific behaviors and what you say to others draw people toward seeking you out for commiseration,\" said Robinson, the co-author of the Harvard Business Review article. \"That's the place to start. Those are the things you can work on changing to lessen this dynamic.\"\n\nIf those tips don't help and toxic handling continues to wear you down, Robinson recommends consulting with a trained psychotherapist.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.90055251121521, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1309, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.23421922317, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170119140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.6042780748663101, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/26/us/miami-fidel-castro-death-reaction/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00ed": [1752]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 716, "scraper_regex": 1015}}, "headline": "Crowds flood streets of Miami's Little Havana to cheer Castro's death ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1015, "date": "20161127020000", "story_content": "News of Fidel Castro's death was quick to reach Miami, the center of the Cuban exile community, where an outpouring of emotion brought jubilant crowds onto the streets of Little Havana.\n\nIt was a party decades in the making, and you could hear it before you could see it.\n\nBrandishing pots and pans, hundreds of elated Cubans paraded through the Miami neighborhood of Little Havana on Saturday night.

Gimenez, said Castro's death \"closes a very painful chapter\" for Cubans and Cuban-Americans \"affected by his cruel and brutal dictatorship.\" \n\nHe said he hoped a \"free and democratic Cuba\" would emerge but cautioned that Fidel's younger brother, President Raul Castro, remained in charge of \"one of the world's most repressive governments.\"\n\nPainful decades of exile\n\nThose out on the streets included Cuban-Americans of all ages, including some who first came from Cuba in 1959 after Castro's revolutionaries ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista.\n\nOthers left in the following decades, many joining their fellow exiles in Miami and elsewhere in the United States.\n\nMore than 260,000 Cubans left in a US-organized airlift between 1965 and 1973.  In 1980, Castro let another 125,000 leave in the chaotic Mariel boatlift. Among them were criminals released from Cuban jails who brought a violent crime wave to Florida. At other times, desperate Cubans fled the island nation in makeshift boats across the treacherous Straits of Florida. Thousands died from drowning or exposure to the brutal Caribbean sun.\n\nFew who left back in 1959 would have believed Fidel Castro would hang on to power for so long, only ceding the presidency to his brother Raul in recent years.\n\nSpeaking alongside other lawmakers from Florida, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, who is Cuban-American, said, \"Today is a reminder of how inevitable it is that the Castro dictatorship will soon enough be a nightmare of the past.\"\n\nCastro lived long enough to see a historic thaw in relations between Cuba and the United States. The two nations re-established diplomatic relations in July 2015, and President Barack Obama visited the island this year.\n\nThat thaw was welcomed particularly by younger Cuban-Americans but was more problematic for many of the older generation, who have supported strict US sanctions for decades as a means to pressure the repressive Cuban government.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 21, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.3285899162292503, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 716, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.94047609189, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161127020000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.18994413407821, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/13/europe/russia-from-anti-us-to-anti-obama-dougherty/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Why Russia is happy to see the back of Obama", "wordcount_as_scraped": 680, "date": "20170113110000", "story_content": "The Obama presidency is almost over -- and Russian officials can't wait.

In October, he called him \"psychotic.\"\n\nThe comments about Obama often have a rueful subtext: If only Obama hadn't ruined relations with Russia, the world would be a much better place.

And this frustration is an expression of their bad manners and Russophobia.\"\n\nCriticism of Obama on Russian social media and the Internet has gone even further. 2016 was the Chinese Year of the Monkey, and racist cartoons of Obama were rife. \n\nAs Obama's last hours in office slip away, Putin remains above the fray, leaving it to his underlings to criticize the outgoing US President. Putin did engage in some diplomatic dissing by not responding to Obama's December decision to expel 35 Russian diplomats in response to Russia's alleged election hacking -- a way of saying to Obama: \"You're not important enough to even respond to.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's government-funded RT television news network has rereleased an ad it made in 2015 for its 10th anniversary.

Channel in 1802, although his plans included an artificial island mid-channel where horse-drawn carriages could make maintenance stops.\n\n\"This tunnel defined the term 'mega project,'\" says Matt

which takes 20 minutes to drive through -- led to innovation in the use of behavioral science and driver psychology in the design to reduce driver fatigue and improve safety,\" says Sykes. \n\n\"This resulted in large, colorfully lit caverns every six kilometers, providing points of interest and a unique driver experience.\"\n\nLength: 24.5 kilometers (15.2 miles)\n\nFast fact: Engineers separated

interstate highway system. \n\nIt played a significant role in the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema was hired as a construction worker in 1972. \n\nHer supervisor misread her name as James, but realized his mistake and reassigned her to administrative duties after workers -- many of whom were former miners -- cited the common superstition that a woman's presence can bring bad luck to a mine. \n\nBonnema sued and was allowed to return to the tunnel. \n\nA new equal rights law was subsequently passed.\n\nLength: 2.72 kilometers (1.7 miles)\n\nFast fact: Prior to the tunnel's official opening in 1972, a drunk driver believed he should be the first person to take a vehicle through and was arrested for trespassing. \n\nCharges were subsequently dropped because the signs prohibiting traffic were considered inadequate.\n\nMore info: Colorado Department of Transportation\n\nMORE: 25 of mankind's greatest engineering achievements \n\nSpiralen Tunnel (Drammen, Norway)\n\nThe dramatic Spiralen road tunnel, built in 1961 and comprising six spirals covering 1,649 meters (5,413 feet), leads to one of the most spectacular viewpoints in the industrial town of Drammen. \n\n\"Despite being an expensive country, Norway builds some of the cheapest tunnels,\" says Alun Thomas, head of tunnels at engineering consultancy Ramboll. \n\n\"This is because the engineers strip the design down to the bare essentials required for the flow of traffic in the tunnels.

At the same time, one should remember the cost and the fact that several villagers were killed during construction.\"\n\nLength: 1.2 kilometers (0.74 miles)\n\nFast fact: The tunnel was built jagged and steep due to the village's primitive tools, earning it the nickname: \"The road that does not tolerate any mistakes.\"\n\nMore info: Guoliang Tunnel\n\nSMART (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia)\n\n\"SMART is a combined road and flood relief tunnel,\" explains Thomas at Ramboll. \n\n\"It can be completely flooded to get rid of storm water and turned back into a road in a few hours.\" \n\nThe tunnel, the longest in Malaysia, was built to solve the problem of flash flooding in Kuala Lumpur. \n\nSMART can operate in three ways. \n\nWhen there's no flooding, it serves purely as a road tunnel.\n\nWhen there are floods, rainwater can be diverted into a lower channel, and the upper level will remain open to traffic. \n\nWhen exceptionally heavy floods occur, the tunnel closes to all traffic and watertight gates open to allow floodwater to flow through.\n\nLength: 9.7 kilometers (6.02 miles)\n\nFast fact: The tunnel is expected to prevent billions of dollars of possible flood damage and costs from traffic congestion. \n\nSince it opened in 2007, flood-prone areas such as Masjid Jamek, Dataran Merdeka, Leboh Ampang and Jalan Melaka have been spared inundation.\n\nMore info: SMART Motorway Tunnel\n\nMORE: Beijing's secret subterranean city\n\nBund Sightseeing Tunnel (Shanghai)\n\nThis underwater Chinese tunnel is short and sweet, but spectacular and slightly strange. \n\nIt spans the Huangpu River and connects Shanghai's Bund to Lujiazui, location of the Pearl TV tower. \n\nPassengers were originally going to be ferried from one side to the other on a moving walkway, but automated cars were installed instead. \n\nLength: 646.7 meters (2,122 feet)\n\nFast fact: A company that had worked with Disney was originally supposed to help design the tunnel, but was deemed too expensive. \n\nInstead a Shanghai-based company created the tunnel's psychedelic lights and trippy audio-visual effects. \n\nThe ride is apparently meant to represent a journey to the core of the earth. \n\nMORE: Underground Budapest: Caverns, churches and Cold War bunkers\n\nSeikan Tunnel (Japan)\n\nThe Seikan is a railway tunnel in Japan, but what makes it unique is the fact that a 23-kilometer (14.2 miles) stretch of the tunnel is 140 meters (460 feet) below sea level. \n\nUntil the Gotthard Base Tunnel came along, it was the longest and deepest rail tunnel in the world.\n\nIt spans the Tsugaru Strait, connecting Aomori Prefecture on the island of Honshu to the island of Hokkaido. \n\nWork on the tunnel started in 1964 and was completed in 1988.\n\nLength: 53 kilometers (32.9 miles)\n\nFast fact: In 1976, construction workers hit a patch of soft rock and water gushed into the tunnel at a rate of 80 tons per minute.

In an op-ed in August, he wrote the two-state solution was just \"an illusion that serves the worst intentions of both the United States and the Palestinian Arabs.\" Friedman said in a statement issued by Trump's transition team announcing his nomination that he was looking forward to relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a provocative move that could threaten US relationships with Arab allies. \n\nFriedman made the comments to Israeli TV in June, when he was advising Trump on Israel. \n\n\"What Mr. Trump believes is that any solution that Israel will propose, whether it's a two-state solution or it's some other creative, out of the box solution, which was designed to bring some incremental level of peace or tranquility to the region, he will be guided by what the Israelis want to pursue,\" Friedman told Israeli station Channel 2. \"Again, what I said earlier I'll repeat. Israel is a friend. The United States under a Trump administration is going to be loyal to its friends. It's going to trust its friend.\"\n\nFriedman added that, \"the Trump administration is not looking to cut back on foreign aid and will, in all likelihood, increase it significantly.\"\n\nFriedman, in a different interview with Israel station News10 in September, again said it would be \"correct\" to say his that Trump would back the Israeli government in whatever path they choose in the peace process.\n\nIn the June interview, Friedman said Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas was not a \"legitimate leader\" and said he didn't think Hillary Clinton or President Obama were neutral in their approach to the peace process.\n\nOn the Iran nuclear deal, Friedman said \"it will be a core foreign policy objective of a Trump administration to undo this.\" \n\nFriedman also said he believed Palestinians would rather live under Israeli rule.\n\n\"I think if you look at the Palestinians, they share something in common with the entire Muslim world, which is 90% or so of them are perfectly fine, good people.

It will add tremendous strength to our strategic defence.\u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) December 26, 2016\n\nBut some in China see the test as a provocation. And provocations can make the region less stable, which can lead to hostilities, says Victor Gao, the director of the China National Association of International Studies.\n\n\"To contemplate a war, especially involving involving nuclear weapons, against each other is completely ludicrous,\" Gao told CNN. \"And it's a misallocation of resources.\" \n\nHua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry, responded to a question about the missile launch by noting UN Security Council regulations regarding nuclear capable ballistic missiles and stressing that the two countries \"are not rivals for competition but partners for cooperation.\"\n\nAn Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman responded by telling CNN that its \"strategic capabilities are not targeted  against any particular country,\" and that the country abides by its international obligations.\n\nBut not everyone shares such a sanguine view of the Sino-Indian relationship.\n\n\"Everyone should be interested in and concerned about India's successful ICBM test, inc(luding) China because it's within range of this new missile and because it especially of the major Asian countries understands the dangers of nationalism and its volatility,\" says Yvonne Chiu, a professor of at Hong Kong University. \n\n'Precisely ambiguous'\n\nIndia and China both maintain what's called a \"no first use\" policy as part of their nuclear doctrine.\n\nThe policy means exactly what it sounds like -- in the event of a war, the country won't use nuclear weapons unless they're attacked by an enemy using nuclear weapons.\n\nBut India's hawkish defense minister, Manohar Parrikar, publicly mused in November whether India should be bound by the \"no first use\" policy.\n\n\"If a written down policy exists, or you take a stand on a nuclear aspect, I think you are truly giving away your strength in nuclear,\" Parrikar said. \"Why should I bind myself? I should say I'm a responsible nuclear power and I will not use it irresponsibly.\"\n\nIt's important to note that Parrikar said those were his personal opinions, and that India's nuclear doctrine was not changing.\n\nAnd he made those comments in November, after tensions with Pakistan were on the rise due to unrest in Kashmir.\n\nBut Parrikar isn't the only one in India questioning the \"no first use\" doctrine. \n\n\"Nuclear deterrence is a curious thing -- it succeeds when it creates doubts in the mind of the adversary state, and doubt is created in the nuclear realm by being precisely ambiguous about your intentions, your capabilities and about the possibilities of its use,\" said Bharat Karnad\u200b,\u200b a professor of national security studies at the Indian Centre for Policy Research. \n\n\"We are far too certain about our retaliatory strike certainties. It's not the kind of certainty you'd like your adversaries to believe, primarily because it undermines your own deterrent posture.\"\n\nIt could be all smoke and mirrors -- what better way to publicly sow doubt about your intentions than to publicly muse about changing them, but in private, stay committed to \"no first use.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nBut any ambiguity doesn't look great from China's position.\n\nWhat would you do if southern neighbor, which you fought a war against in the 1960s, starts beating nationalist drums and gives mixed messages on whether or not they'll fire a nuke first in a war?\n\n\"In today's world, to position yourself in terms of a nuclear strike against your neighbor is the wrong policy. And therefore I'm a little bit frightened and disappointed by this kind of high-level of excitement in India about the new ICBM capability,\" Gao said. \n\nKeeping enemies closer? \n\nIndian Prime Minister Modi has made rapprochement a staple of his China policy since he took office.\n\nModi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met early at the start of the Indian leader's premiership in 2014. The two sides spoke glowingly of what the countries could accomplish by working together. \n\nGao, who was Deng Xiapoing's translator, believes Modi has done a good job engaging with China.\n\nBut just because trade and diplomatic ties are strengthened doesn't preclude India from trying to catch up to China militarily. \n\n\"There are long-standing tensions and ongoing disputes between the two countries, and one possible path to better relations is to come at it from a position of relative strength, particularly if the increased strength in question is both a genuine threat (nuclear capability),\" Chiu, the professor at HKU, told CNN in an email. \n\nThe elephant in the room\n\nPakistan is the big wild card.\n\nThe country, which boasts its own nuclear arsenal, is India's historic adversary and considered an \"all-weather\" friend of China. \n\nThose relationships form a double-edged sword, analysts say.\n\nOn the one hand, it offers India an excuse for building up its missile systems that doesn't involve China, so \"both sides can continue relations without the sense one of them has suddenly been put under undue pressure,\" Chiu says.\n\nBut it's not clear if China is buying that argument. \n\nPatrick Bratton, an associate professor of national security strategy at the US Army War College, says that contrary to popular beliefs, China, not Pakistan, was the original focus of the Indian nuclear weapons program.\n\nAnd Pakistan was already in range of India's nuclear-capable missiles before the Agni-V was developed. \n\nThe other big concern is that Pakistan sees the Agni-V development as proof it's falling behind in an arms race. \n\n\"There are multiple audiences for this missile test and multiple possible targets, and I think India's increased capability will ultimately be more of a concern for Pakistan, since it does not yet have a missile with that range of capacity,\" says Chiu. \n\nSo by trying to level the playing field with China in terms of nuclear deterrence, India could in effect have spurred Pakistan into the arms race. \n\n\"That's both the logic and illogic of nuclear deterrence,\" Chiu says.\n\nThe good news \n\nMany analysts don't believe the countries would go to war for a host of reasons, the biggest being that both sides are acutely aware of how destructive it could be.\n\nAs far as we know, India does not currently keep its warheads and delivery systems -- the missiles and rockets that would be used to launch a nuke at an adversary -- in the same location, ready to use at a moment's notice, Bratton said in an email to CNN.\n\nAnd though the December missile test of the Agni-V was the fourth successful one, it was only the second time the projectile was launched from a canister.\n\nThat likely means India will need to conduct more tests, meaning it could be years before the system is deployed and operational, Bratton said.\n\n\"India has been working on developing this capability for a number of decades and it's no surprise for China,\" he said. \"This should not be seen as a radical departure in Sino-Indian relations.\"\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated when India and China fought a border war.

The researchers followed 14 contestants who had participated in the \"World's Biggest Loser\" reality show. During the 30 weeks of the show, the contestants lost an average of over 125 pounds per person. \n\nBut in the six years after the show, all but one gained back most of their lost weight, despite continuing to diet and exercise.\n\nWhy is it so hard to lose weight and keep it off? Weight loss often leads to declines in our resting metabolic rate -- how many calories we burn at rest, which makes it hard to keep the weight off. \n\nSo why does weight loss make resting metabolism go down, and is there a way to maintain a normal resting metabolic rate after weight loss? As someone who studies musculo-skeletal physiology, I will try to answer these questions.\n\nActivating muscles deep in the leg that help keep blood and fluid moving through our bodies is essential to maintaining resting metabolic rate when we are sitting or standing quietly. The function of these muscles, called soleus muscles, is a major research focus for us in the Clinical Science and Engineering Research Center at Binghamton University. Commonly called \"secondary hearts,\" these muscles pump blood back to our heart, allowing us to maintain our normal rate of metabolic activity during sedentary activities.\n\nResting metabolism and weight maintenance\n\nResting metabolic rate (RMR) refers to all of the biochemical activity going on in your body when you are not physically active. It is this metabolic activity that keeps you alive and breathing, and very importantly, warm.\n\nQuiet sitting at room temperature is the standard RMR reference point; this is referred to as one metabolic equivalent, or MET. A slow walk is about two MET, bicycling four MET, and jogging seven MET. While we need to move around a bit to complete the tasks of daily living, in modern life we tend not to move very much. Thus, for most people, 80 percent of the calories we expend each day are due to RMR.\n\nWhen you lose weight, your RMR should fall a small amount, as you are losing some muscle tissue. But when most of the weight loss is fat, we would expect to see only a small drop in RMR, as fat is not metabolically very active. What is surprising is that relatively large drops in RMR are quite common among individuals who lose body fat through diet or exercise.\n\nThe \"World's Biggest Loser\" contestants, for example, experienced a drop in their resting metabolic rate of almost 30 percent even though 80 percent of their weight loss was due to fat loss. A simple calculation shows that making up for such a large drop in RMR would require almost two hours a day of brisk walking, seven days a week, on top of a person's normal daily activities. Most people cannot fit this activity level into their lifestyle.\n\nFeast then famine: How fasting may might make our cells more resilient to stress\n\nThere's no question that eating a balanced diet and regular exercise are good for you, but from a weight management perspective, increasing your resting metabolic rate may be the more effective strategy for losing weight and maintaining that lost weight.\n\nThe connection between RMR and your heart\n\nMetabolic activity is dependent on oxygen delivery to the tissues of the body. This occurs through blood flow. As a result, cardiac output is a primary determinant of metabolic activity.\n\nThe adult body contains about four to five liters of blood, and all of this blood should circulate throughout the body every minute or so. However, the amount of blood the heart can pump out with each beat is dependent on how much blood is returned to the heart between beats.\n\nIf the \"plumbing\" of our body, our veins in particular, was made of rigid pipes, and the skin of our legs was tough like that of bird legs, cardiac outflow would always equal cardiac inflow, but this is not the case. The veins in our body are are quite flexible and can expand many times their resting size, and our soft skin also allows lower body volume expansion.\n\nAs a result, when we are sitting quietly, blood and interstitial fluid (the fluid which surrounds all the cells in our body) pools in the lower parts of the body. This pooling significantly reduces the amount of fluid returning to the heart, and correspondingly, reduces how much fluid the heart can pump out during each contraction. This reduces cardiac output, which dictates a reduced RMR.\n\nOur research has shown that for typical middle-aged women, cardiac output will drop about 20 percent when sitting quietly. For individuals who have recently lost weight, the fluid pooling situation can be greater because their skin is now much looser, providing much more space for fluids to pool. This is especially the case for people experiencing rapid weight loss, as their skin has not had time to contract.\n\nRaising metabolic activity\n\nFor young, healthy individuals, this pooling of fluid when sitting is limited because specialized muscles in the calves of the legs -- the soleus muscles -- pump blood and interstitial fluid back up to heart. This is why soleus muscles are often referred to as our \"secondary hearts.\" However, our modern, sedentary lifestyles mean that our secondary hearts tend to weaken, which permits excessive fluid pooling into the lower body. This situation is now commonly referred to as \"sitting disease.\"\n\nSex and other myths about weight loss\n\nMoreover, excessive fluid pooling can create a vicious cycle. Fluid pooling reduces RMR, and reduced RMR means less body heat generation, which results in a further drop in body temperature; people with low RMR often have persistently cold hands and feet. As metabolic activity is strongly dependent on tissue temperature, RMR will therefore fall even more. Just a 1 degree Fahrenheit drop in body temperature can produce a 7 percent drop in RMR.\n\nOne logical, though expensive, approach to reduce fluid pooling after weight loss would be to undergo cosmetic surgery to remove excess skin to eliminate the fluid pooling space created by the weight loss. Indeed, a recent study has confirmed that people who had body contouring surgery after losing large amounts of weight due to gastric banding surgery had better long-term control of their body mass index than people who did not have body contouring surgery.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nA much more convenient approach to maintaining RMR during and after weight loss is to train up your secondary hearts, or soleus muscles. The soleus muscles are deep postural muscles and so only require low-intensity, but long-duration, training. \n\nYou don't have to be the biggest loser to achieve weight loss success\n\nPerhaps the best strategy for training up the soleus muscles is to practice squatting. Squatting is how our primitive ancestors sat and how many people in third world countries currently \"sit\" without the use of chairs. Squatting to any degree triggers a significant increase in soleus muscle activity (PDF). Moreover, if you can learn to perform a full squat, you can maintain that position for extended periods of time, resulting in well-trained soleus muscles.  \n\nFor those who find squatting difficult, a number of tasks and exercises that require extended balancing activity provide similar training for your soleus muscles. For example, working on a ladder forces you to stand on your toes for extended time periods. And both yoga and tai chi incorporate long-duration balance exercises that serve to strengthen the soleus muscles. The heel raise exercises recommended by airlines as a means to reduce the risk of developing deep vein thromboses (DVT) on long distance flights are also a form of soleus muscle exercise.\n\nAlternatively, if squatting or long-duration balance exercises do not fit into your lifestyle, passive exercise devices will stimulate those muscles as you sit are available. (Full disclosure: Binghamton University has licensed technology to a company, which I have shares in and consult for, to commercialize such a device.) The concept here is that specific mechanical vibrations can be used to activate receptors on the sole of the foot, which trigger a postural reflex arc, which in turn causes the soleus muscles to undergo reflex contractions.\n\nIn a study of 54 women between the ages of 18 and 65 years, we found that 24 had secondary heart insufficiency leading to excessive fluid pooling in the legs, and for these women, this type of soleus muscle stimulation was found to reverse fluid pooling. The ability to prevent or reverse fluid pooling, allowing individuals to maintain cardiac output, should, in theory, help these individuals maintain RMR while sedentary. \n\nRecent, unpublished, work shows that by reversing fluid pooling, cardiac output can be raised back to normal levels. These study results also indicate that by raising cardiac output back to normal resting levels, RMR returns to normal levels while individuals are sitting quietly.

An unapologetic nationalist is bound for the White House, Republicans are in control of both houses of Congress\u2014and the world body is in their crosshairs.\n\nLast week's Security Council vote to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank\u2014a resolution on which the Obama administration controversially abstained\u2014has enraged GOP legislators. The President-elect has also lashed out, tweeting, \"The United Nations has such great potential. But right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. Sad!\" Secretary of State John Kerry tried today to defend US diplomacy at the UN, but Republicans on Capitol Hill are determined to pass legislation condemning the Council.\n\nThe US-UN relationship is fraught in the best of times -- during the George W. Bush administration when the US imposed a unilateral vision globally, or during the 1990s, when Sen. Jesse Helms bedeviled the United Nations and created a financial crisis at the institution by withholding US dues.  Conservative critics, both in and outside government, regularly scapegoat the UN for the failures of its member states. And because it lacks a domestic constituency, it is an irresistible target for nationalist demagogues.  \n\nAfter eight years of the most multilaterally-inclined US administration in history, the United Nations is in for a shock. Donald Trump is the new sheriff in town. Where President Obama proclaimed himself a \"citizen of the world,\" Trump is channeling a populist base deeply skeptical of international organizations, where paranoid fantasies about UN \"black helicopters\" as a threat to American sovereignty run deep.\n\nThe international organization is certainly flawed and often exasperating\u2014but it is the best vehicle the United States has for advancing its agenda in the world and sharing the burden with others.\n\nBy rare coincidence, the quadrennial transition to a new US administration occurs just as a new UN secretary-general takes up his five-year term. (The only previous time was in 1953, when Dag Hammarskjold took up his position as secretary-general shortly after Eisenhower took office). Into this unpromising setting walks Antonio Guterres, who on January 1 will become the UN's ninth secretary-general. Guterres is an accomplished and dynamic leader. But he will be hard pressed to ward off US assaults on the global organization.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump embraced a slew of unilateralist, nationalist and often immoral positions that put him on a collision course with the United Nations. These included promising to walk away from the Paris climate accord, rip up the nuclear deal with Iran, deny admission of refugees, reinstate torture and violate international humanitarian law in combating terrorism. Though Trump has since walked back on some of these pledges, his unpredictability makes it impossible to know whether he will again reverse course.\n\nCompounding the UN's predicament, longstanding critics in the House and Senate are determined to bring it to heel. One is US Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who has repeatedly introduced legislation to fundamentally alter US  funding for the United Nations, so that US contributions to the UN's budget are no longer automatically assessed (and legally binding) but purely \"voluntary.\" This would be disastrous for the UN, as other UN member states would inevitably follow suit. But it has long been a daydream of UN critics and was recently endorsed by former US envoy John Bolton, mentioned as a possible senior official in the Trump administration.\n\nGuterres is in many respects an ideal selection to fend off the negative impact of a unilaterally-inclined US administration and a micromanaging Congress. He is a former prime minister of Portugal, a US NATO ally, but also enjoys solid backing from both Russia and China. His long tenure as UN High Commissioner for Refugees will be indispensable at a time when the world has more people displaced by violence than at any time in history. Significantly, Guterres was chosen in a (relatively) open process that included unprecedented interviews by all candidates before the UN General Assembly.\n\nBut he will need to walk a tightrope. On the one hand, he must assure American skeptics that he will wisely steward US taxpayer dollars, as well as advance the internal reform agenda left hanging by his predecessor, Ban Ki-Moon, who made little headway in overhauling the UN's dysfunctional management practices. On the other, he cannot afford to alienate other member states by seeming to be America's lackey. Striking this balance will be tough.\n\nHis first step should be to launch quiet consultations both with the President-elect and members of Congress. Trump's inner circle\u2014including Nikki Haley, his envisioned UN envoy\u2014is entirely devoid of diplomatic experience. Guterres needs to deliver a pragmatic message to them: Regardless of the international organization's many flaws, the United States will return again and again to the United Nations\u2014just as it did under George W. Bush\u2014to get things done.\n\nThis message could resonate with Donald Trump. The President-elect clearly seeks a future in which the United States does less and others do more. The United Nations\u2014where the United States gets a dollar of effort for every quarter it puts in\u2014can help others share the burden. More specifically, if President Trump and Vladimir Putin manage to negotiate a deal on Syria, they will need the UN to bless it\u2014and assist with its implementation.\n\nThe past quarter century shows how easy it is for a UN secretary-general to run afoul of Washington. The Clinton administration denied a second term to Boutros Boutros Ghali, while his successor Kofi Annan parted sharply from George W. Bush over the war in Iraq. Guterres is a forceful personality, and he will be drawn to the secretary-general's role as the voice of humanity's moral conscience. But he would be wise to remember that American presidents prefer their secretaries-general to be (as the saying goes) more secretary than general. This will be particularly true of the incoming occupant of the White House, who already has enough generals of his own.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 31, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.21715807914734, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1019, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 8.494042637669999, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 31, "mft_sum": 53, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161228220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.20117762512267, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.81818181818}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/27/opinions/new-age-of-information-warfare-opinion-kaine/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Tim Kaine: We're in the new age of information warfare ... and we're losing", "wordcount_as_scraped": 743, "date": "20170127140000", "story_content": "When asked to comment on the Russians hacking the election, President Donald Trump has said it's time for our country to \"move on.\" In a way, he's right.  It's time that we move past questioning the intelligence community's findings and start accepting that our adversaries are waging a new kind of information war against us -- and we're losing.            \n\nAnti-democratic regimes view the free flow of information as threatening to their foundations of power. For decades, these regimes have perfected the arts of suppressing truth and spreading propaganda to protect their interests. They have weaponized the Internet against our democracies using these same tactics.\n\nRussia's interference in the US election is the latest example demonstrating that the United States is ill-equipped to respond to information warfare in the 21st century. As the January 6 Intelligence Community Assessment states, Russia's \"election operation signals a new normal\" for future influence campaigns against the United States and other nations worldwide. A fundamental change in US policy is required to secure our democratic institutions and those of our allies amid the changing character of information warfare in the digital age.   \n\nRussia is not the only adversary waging an influence campaign. For years, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which is another name for ISIS, has inspired new recruits around the world by spreading false narratives on social media. By convincing some young Muslims that Islam is at war with the West, ISIL has successfully conducted a robust online recruiting campaign at little cost to the organization. \n\nPart of the problem is that our tools for responding are predictable and not always easy to deploy. The Obama administration's responses to Russia -- sanctions and expelling diplomats -- came too late and appeared to have no impact on Putin's calculus. Task forces and traditional intelligence gathering are invaluable assets, but they have not stopped ISIL from spreading its message.\n\nThe need for better tactics and analysis, a counter-message and an over-arching influence strategy is apparent.  But who should develop this strategy?  Should the Department of Defense be charged with countering ISIL's activities on Twitter, or should this responsibility transcend the military? \n\nI am deeply concerned that we have failed to grasp the gravity of the challenge before us.  While some view this debate through a partisan lens or merely as a continuation of the 2016 campaign, Russia has moved on to targeting the upcoming elections of our European allies, France and Germany.  Already, adversaries appear to have begun eroding public trust in German Chancellor Angela Merkel through disinformation campaigns \n\nAnd the nationalist candidate in France, Marine Le Pen, has been viewed suspiciously because of loans obtained by her organization from Russian banks.\n\nWhen Le Pen was asked earlier this month to comment on the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's interference in the US election, she reportedly dismissed the findings as conspiracy theories.  \"I am not sure that there is really serious evidence behind these accusations of cyberattacks,\" she said.  Sound familiar?   \n\nIf the objective is to divide and undermine liberal democracies, future targets are in plain view.  We need to focus on supporting them by ensuring that our government has the strategy, capacity and intent to combat misinformation campaigns and defend liberal values worldwide.    \n\nSome might argue that undertaking a large-scale effort to combat information warfare will distract from more important issues: mainly, protecting our critical infrastructure and deterring military campaigns overseas. Information warfare tactics should not compete with more traditional ones -- they should complement them. We need a team or agency charged with honing informational tools to be included among the instruments of national power that we use today to safeguard our economic, military, and diplomatic interests.  \n\nIn a Senate Armed Services Hearing on January 5, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said that we need a strong agency \"that deals with the totality of the information realm...in all forums and to include social media.\"  He alluded to the once-venerable US Information Agency, which promoted American values during the Cold War but dissolved in 1999.  \n\nI agree with Director Clapper.  We must brace ourselves for continued attacks in the information realm and prepare to fight back using non-traditional tools. Congress should explore making fundamental changes to how our government is currently organized to tackle the challenges of the digital age.  A solution could be a re-invigorated US Information Agency or something entirely new.

Not so for FBI Director James Comey who sounded on Thursday like he was about to contort his 6'8\" frame into a happy dance to celebrate Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's announcement that Comey, the FBI and the Justice Department will be investigated for their handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation and other election-related issues. \n\n \n\nComey reacted to the announced probe by saying that he was \"grateful to the Department of Justice IG for taking on this review\" and further elaborated that \"everyone will benefit from thoughtful evaluation and transparency regarding this matter.\" If Mr. Comey is grateful for an investigation by the Inspector General, he must have a fondness for root canals as well.\n\n \n\nFor those who may have forgotten the salient details of the Comey matter in the avalanche of other post-election controversies, the FBI Director found himself front and center in the presidential election when his putative boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch engaged in an unscheduled airport meeting with former President Bill Clinton while the Department of Justice was investigating the matter of Hillary Clinton's email practices.\n\n \n\nThe Attorney General sought to restore public confidence in the investigation by ceding final decision-making power regarding it to Comey, placing the then widely-respected FBI director in the hottest of Washington hot seats.\n\n \n\nIn a foolish but undoubtedly sincere attempt to preserve the integrity of the FBI, he pushed his agents to wrap up the investigation, enabling him to issue what he described as an \"unusual statement\" containing more \"detail\" about the investigative process than is customary when investigations are closed. Comey noted that this was necessary because of the \"intense public interest\" in the case.\n\n \n\nLast July, he told the nation that the FBI investigation of Secretary Clinton was now closed with no evidence of criminality having been found. He then tempered this exoneration with a series of devastating criticisms of the cavalier way classified documents were handled by the Clinton and her staff.\n\n \n\nThe former Secretary of State was accused of being \"extremely careless\" in the handling of highly classified material, a term of art perilously close to the concepts of \"gross negligence \" and \"recklessness\" often used in criminal indictments. Ultimately, however, Comey concluded that no reasonable prosecutor would bring criminal charges on the evidence at hand.\n\nIn his vain attempt to put the controversial investigation to bed, Comey had supplied both Democrats and Republicans with an arsenal of inflammatory campaign rhetoric which would simmer and then flare up throughout the campaign.\n\n \n\nIt got worse\n\nThings only got worse when, 11 days before the election, the Director suggested that the investigation had to be reopened because a computer with possibly relevant information belonging to the controversial, Twitter-addicted husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin had been discovered.\n\n \n\nA few days later, just before the election, the FBI admitted that nothing relevant or incriminating had been found. Secretary Clinton was cleared again.\n\n \n\nIn the end Comey's decision to abandon the Department of Justice's sensible rule sharply limiting the issuance of interim announcements regarding ongoing investigations had disastrous results. Both the Trump and Clinton camps suspected a secret agenda focused on torpedoing their candidate while the public lost confidence in that once hallowed law enforcement institution, the FBI.\n\n\u200b\n\nNow, another investigation\n\nEnter now the Department of Justice Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, to stir the still smoking embers of the Comey investigative fiasco with yet another investigation. The investigators will now be investigated. Horowitz, like Comey, is a former assistant US Attorney as well as a former Deputy Attorney General. (The Inspector General, many will be surprised to hear, heads up an office at the Department of Justice of over 400 employees. The Department of Justice law enforcement professionals are supposed to be honest individuals, sworn to fight the bad guys and protect the public. Why do we need 400 people watching them?)\n\n \n\nHow this will ultimately turn out is hard to predict with certainty. Though the Inspector General is empowered to recommend criminal charges, if warranted, such an outcome is highly unlikely on these facts. In the end a scathing report criticizing Comey's decision to go public with investigative details of the Clinton email scandal along with appropriate reprimands is the more likely outcome.\n\n \n\nDonald Trump, upon assuming the presidency, will probably be looking to appoint his own FBI director rather than leaving the unpredictable James Comey in position to investigate the Trump Administration and/or Russian hacking and emails.\n\n \n\nWhile in theory, the new President Trump could defy recent presidential custom and practice to force the resignation of Inspector General Horowitz, such an act, though perfectly legal, would look too political and undermine Trump's quest to appear as the new honest, house-cleaning president. He sent a strong hint of his likely approach in forcing Republicans in Congress to back off on their ill-fated plan to eliminate the Congressional ethics monitoring system. The IG is a version of that committee in the executive branch, so keeping Horowitz in place would be a sensible approach. \n\n \n\nA critical report by the IG could give President Trump sufficient ammunition to push Comey out of J. Edgar Hoover's historic seat.  Although the FBI Director in theory serves a 10-year term (and Comey began his in 2013), it is hard to believe that he could survive the determined attack and opposition of the president he serves in the executive branch. Horowitz' report could give the president the \"good cause\" some legal experts believe he would need to terminate the FBI Director. \n\n \n\nMore likely the director would simply resign and secure a lucrative partnership at a prosperous private sector law firm rather than face a painful hearing process.   \n\nIn the end, Comey's end run around the DOJ rulebook may have destroyed not only the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton but also his own career and reputation.

During his Senate confirmation hearings this week, the former Exxon Mobil chief boldly declared that China's militarization of artificial islets in the South China Sea was \"akin to Russia's taking Crimea\" from Ukraine -- a comparison that will ruffle feathers in Beijing.\n\nEchoing the views of many Asia analysts in Trump's team and across the political spectrum in Washington, Tillerson criticized President Barack Obama's South China Sea policy for being inadequate -- implying that periodic naval patrols were not a sufficiently muscular response to stop China from continually \"pushing the envelope.\"\n\nBut his most controversial remarks concerned what America's South China Sea goals should be going forward. Beyond convincing Beijing to stop its island-building -- which the Obama administration has tried but been unable to do -- Tillerson said: \"We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands also not going to be allowed.\"\n\nNo one in Washington has seriously entertained this option. Blocking Chinese naval vessels from accessing South China Sea reefs would almost certainly trigger a US-China clash. More to the point: as many of the reefs are effectively a part of international waters, preventing Chinese ships from sailing to or near them would undermine the very freedom of navigation rules that the US has been trying to uphold.\n\nWhile we shouldn't read too much into this aspect of Tillerson's remarks -- after all, people make mistakes during hours-long grillings by Senate committees, especially when they're new to the issues -- the overall tone of his testimony was tough on China.\n\nIf Obama's team was at times too cautious in taking China to task, Tillerson's blunt talk of China's \"extremely worrisome\" and \"illegal\" actions will bring a sharpness to State Department policy that hasn't previously been present.      \n\nCounterproductive on North Korea?\n\nTrump and Tillerson have also harshly criticized Beijing for its failure to help the US enforce United Nations sanctions on North Korea -- a hawkish approach that may ultimately backfire.\n\nAlthough the President-elect began by tweeting about his disappointment earlier this month, Tillerson, in his hearing, turned up the heat. In unusually frank terms, he stated Washington can no longer accept Beijing's \"empty promises\" on North Korea and should consider putting \"secondary sanctions\" on Chinese entities that are violating sanctions in order to \"compel\" Beijing to finally comply.\n\nThey are correct Beijing should do more to enforce UN Security Council sanctions that seek to place pressure on Kim Jong Un's regime for its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Despite agreeing to two rounds of ostensibly tough sanctions in 2016, China has consistently found ways to avoid truly enforcing these measures -- such as not sufficiently cracking down on the vast number of small Chinese companies that import North Korean coal in excess of the UN's restrictions.\n\nBut publicly deriding China for its failure to fully comply with sanctions only pushes Beijing onto the defensive. Chinese officials have already rejected Trump's accusations and talked up their own efforts to build stability on the Korean Peninsula, and will rile at Tillerson's latest rebuke. The net effect will be an acrimonious bilateral context in which US-China coordination on North Korea, or quiet pressure on Beijing, will be more difficult.\n\nAs any long-term solution to restraining North Korea's nuclear ambitions will require the active participation of China, creating a public rift on this issue is counterproductive. Trump's foreign policy team should instead continue to place behind-the-scenes pressure on China over poor sanctions enforcement, using private diplomatic avenues that won't cause Beijing to clam up on cooperation.\n\nA more unstable US-China relationship\n\nWhile there is a need for firmer American action in the South China Sea and on North Korea, the Trump administration is shaping up to have a hardline China policy across the board.\n\nSince winning the election, Trump has continued to announce that China is stealing US jobs, manipulating its currency, and regularly hacking US institutions. He and his team have stoked uncertainty over the future of US-Taiwan relations -- a core concern for Beijing -- and talked up a larger US military footprint in the Asia-Pacific, all while criticizing Chinese inaction on North Korea and its maritime assertiveness in Asian waters.\n\nThis is a mistake. Getting tough on China on everything at once isn't going to induce Beijing to cooperate or make difficult concessions.\n\nA purely muscular approach, if this comes to pass, will make Beijing a more truculent partner for Washington across the board. The consequences will be negative for US-China relations globally -- making it harder for the two powers to work together on issues of mutual interest, such as crisis management and environmental protection, while deepening friction in major areas of disagreement, like Asia's future strategic order.\n\nInstead, Tillerson and the rest of Trump's foreign policy team should prioritize areas where a tougher approach to China is warranted -- such as in the South China Sea -- and concentrate their efforts to affect changes there. This will, at times, require strong public statements and US actions, but should be coupled with private diplomatic pressure that's not tweeted in 140 characters or less.\n\nChina has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017\n\nLess important challenges in US-China relations will have to be sidelined for the short term or managed quietly and slowly. No major power relationship can endure hostility on all fronts at once without slipping into a Cold War-esque state.\n\nAt this very early point in Trump's incoming presidency, it seems unlikely his administration will choose heed these calls for moderation. But the reality of negotiating compromises and deals with a major power competitor may well force Trump's team to pick their battles carefully in order to get things done.

There are many reasons to think about eating better, but they do not all have to do with weight loss. Your food choices can help reduce stress in your body by reducing the number of free radicals in your cells.\n\nWhile traditional holiday meals are laden with salt, fat and sugar, many foods we eat regularly, such as sweets and sodas, can also spike blood glucose and insulin levels. They also, alas, can increase the amount of free radicals, or molecules with unattached electrons, in the body, which can do serious cellular damage. \n\nHealth check: Antioxidants vs. free radicals\n\nWe hear a lot about antioxidants, and we are encouraged to eat foods that are rich in them. But what exactly are they, and why do we need them? As a researcher who examines cellular damage, I will explain the oxidative process and why it's important to curb it. Free radicals - cellular bad guys - are produced during the oxidative process. Antioxidants work to prevent some of the damage.\n\nElectron shuffling\n\nIf a substance is \"oxidized,\" it has lost electrons to another substance. In contrast, we say a substance is \"reduced\" when it has gained electrons from another substance. Oxidizing agents are called electron acceptors, because they remove electrons from a substance, putting them in a state of loss, or oxidized. Oxidizing agents keep electrons for themselves.\n\nThe oxidizing agents that have accepted electrons become free radicals if the unpaired electrons don't bind to other molecules. These free radicals mess with our cellular metabolism, even interfering with our DNA.\n\nNutrient metabolism and free radical formation\n\nOur mitochondria, which operate like little factories in our cells, are responsible for burning fuel from food and producing energy in each of our cells via a process called oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic pathway is a cellular chain reaction that involves a series of oxidation and reduction reactions in which atoms try to give or receive enough electrons to have a full \"shell.\" Most atoms have a matching number of protons and electrons, but this leaves the various \"shells\" of electrons incomplete, rendering them vulnerable to scavenge the body in search of electrons for pairing.\n\nForget the antioxidant pills; just stick with veggies\n\nNormally, when an electron separates from a molecule involved in oxidation and reduction, it reattaches almost immediately to another. But when they don't, free radicals form.\n\nUnder ordinary conditions, this oxidative process creates chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen. This in turn can lead to the production of molecules of free radicals that are unstable in high concentrations.\n\nNot all free radicals are bad. Free radical formation is crucial to the process of oxidizing nutrients from our food into chemical energy.\n\nFree radical accumulation, however, be it atoms, ions or molecules, is harmful and can have severe consequences on our health. These unstable molecules are detrimental to the proper structure and function of cells throughout the body due to their ability to oxidize cells, known as oxidative stress.\n\nFree radicals damage the growth, development and survival of cells in the body. Their reactive nature allows them to engage in unnecessary side reactions causing cellular impairment and eventually injury when they are present in disproportionate amounts.\n\nWhy most food labels are wrong about calories\n\nThey directly impair cell membranes and DNA. This leads to cell mutation and causes new cells to grow erroneously, which means free radicals are associated with both development of cancer as well as the progression of aging. Free radicals are frequently implicated with health problems that are experienced with age, such as hardened arteries, diabetes and even wrinkle formation.\n\nAntioxidant-rich holiday foods\n\nOvereating further increases free radical production. As we eat more, our mitochondria release more activated oxygen than normal during energy consumption, thus generating higher levels of free radicals. And, risk of oxidative stress is greater when certain types of foods are consumed and the degree of danger can be influenced by the way in which they are prepared or cooked.\n\nYou can avoid sources of free radicals by planning ahead and incorporating healthy foods in your everyday life, not just during the holidays but year-round. Keep in mind that free radical content is high in nutrient-poor meals and those deficient of antioxidants.\n\n    Avoid high glycemic foods, or foods that are rich in refined carbohydrates and sugars. They are more likely to generate free radicals.    Limit processed meats such as sausages, bacon and salami. They contain preservatives, which leads to the production of free radicals.    Limit red meat. It is particularly more vulnerable to oxidation because of its high iron content.    Don't reuse cooking fats and oils. Heating fats and oils during cooking oxidizes them, generating free radicals which seep into our foods.    Limit alcohol. Alcoholic drinks not only are high in calories but also can produce free radicals in the body. Try to limit your drinks to one or two per day.    Eat foods rich in antioxidants, chemicals that inhibit the oxidation of molecules by neutralizing free radicals, thereby stopping them from causing cellular damage. Antioxidants are found in a variety of plants in the form of vitamins A, C and E, selenium and certain phytonutrients and polyphenols. Cranberries are loaded with them!    Look for foods with \u03b2-carotene, lycopene and lutein, including broccoli flowers, alfalfa sprouts, Brussels sprouts, carrots, collard greens, corn, mango and tomatoes. These foods can be incorporated into several side dishes such as vegetable medleys, casseroles and salads.    Consider fruit for dessert instead of rich pies and cakes. Apples, cantaloupe, cherries, grapefruit, kiwi, papaya, red grapes, blackberries, raspberries and strawberries are delightful on their own or when mixed to create lovely fruit salads.    Grab some nuts -- always plentiful at the holidays -- and other foods rich in vitamin E, such as sweet potatoes.    Plant metabolites called flavonoids also demonstrate antioxidant functions. Some versatile antioxidant-rich flavonoids include onions, eggplant, lettuce, turnip greens, endives, pears, red wine, parsley, citrus fruits, berries, cherries, plums, legumes, soybeans, milk, cheese, tofu and miso.    Enjoy antioxidant superfoods, those with high levels of more than one vitamin. These are prunes, plums, raisins, blueberries, cranberries, figs, oranges, pomegranates, sweet red bell peppers, beets, kale, spinach and dark chocolate.    Try herbal therapy -- in your food! Many spices can not only enhance the flavor of our holiday turkeys and hams but also reduce oxidative stress. These include ginger, grape seed extract, ginkgo, rosemary and turmeric.    Take time for tea. When the evening comes to an end, you can revel in a gentle and soothing cup of warm green tea and be comforted in knowing that the polyphenols in your brew also combat oxidation.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.88953483104706, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 641, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.7296634173099998, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161230130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.87207488299532, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/world-wary-unpredictable-donald-trump/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1069, "scraper_regex": 1127}}, "headline": "World resigned, but wary of unpredictable Donald Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1127, "date": "20161110010000", "story_content": "American allies woke up to Donald Trump's victory early Wednesday deeply unsettled, questioning whether the US will remain a stalwart partner and a stable pillar of the international order.\n\nTrump himself promised change and uncertainty in his first major foreign policy address in April, saying he would \"shake the rust off America's foreign policy\" and that the US would \"have to be unpredictable, and we have to be unpredictable starting now.\"\n\nEarly Wednesday, in his acceptance speech, he said he wanted to \"tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone.\" \n\nFrench President Francois Hollande delivered an unusually bald response -- at a level of government where concerns are usually cloaked in diplomatic bon mots -- laying bare the risks international counterparts see in the wild card that is the US President-elect.\n\n\"These American elections open a period of uncertainty,\" Holland said. \"I have to say this clearly and frankly.\"\n\nLaying out the various issues France and the US collaborate on, including terrorism and climate change, Hollande went on to say that \"what's at risk is peace, the fight against terrorism, the situation in the Middle East, economic ties and the preservation of our planet.\"\n\nRELATED: Why the country can be vulnerable during presidential transitions \n\nOver the months of the 2016 campaign, the real estate mogul offered foreign policy positions that would rewrite bedrock alliances in Asia, Europe and the Middle East and re-work established international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement to stem climate change. He's emphasized isolationist, protectionist themes and adopted a slogan that echoes the \"America First\" group that advocated for the US to stay out of World War II.\n\nTrump might apply those principles from the Oval Office in targeting two of President Barack Obama's most high-profile foreign policy achievements.\n\nHe has pledged to reopen the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama administration negotiated over years with a slew of international partners, including the UN. He has also said he would consider reversing recently thawed diplomatic relations with Cuba. \n\nAt the White House, Spokesman Josh Earnest was asked about the possibility that Trump could undo the president's legacy. \"It's far too early to tell what decisions President-elect Trump will make and what impact they'll have on policies President Obama has worked so hard to achieve,\" Earnest said.\n\nIn statement after statement Wednesday, world leaders sought reassurance about their ties to the US. And after a bitter and divisive election campaign in which Trump was seen to marginalize and insult large groups of people, many looked for a reaffirmation of the values they associate with the world's most powerful country.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel offered her country's cooperation, but with strings.\n\n\"Germany and the United States (are) joined by common values -- democracy, freedom, respect for the law and human dignity -- regardless of skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political beliefs,\" Merkel said. \"Based on these values, I offer close cooperation to the future president.\"\n\n \n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk, who is wrestling with a migrant crisis driven by Syria's civil war and with Russian aggression along the Baltic states and in Ukraine, said that, \"While respecting the democratic choice of the American people, we are at the same time aware of the new challenges that these results bring. One of them is this moment of uncertainty over the future of our transatlantic relations.\"\n\nIf Trump is to be taken at his word, there will be many question marks about the future of US relations across the Atlantic and Pacific.\n\nIn Europe, Trump has questioned whether NATO is still relevant and demanded that member states pay more for defense spending. Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader, despite Russia's military incursion into US ally Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea, which triggered Western sanctions.\n\nThat act violated a central tenet of modern international relations -- that national borders are inviolate. But Trump has suggested that he and Putin will work well together and that Russia \"is not going to go into Ukraine.\"\n\nPutin congratulated Trump in a statement, saying, \"Russia is ready and wants to restore the full-fledged relations with the US.\" He added that it would \"serve the well-being of both Russia and American peoples.\"\n\nRussian parliament member Vyacheslav Nikonov told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Moscow thinks Trump \"understands some realities\" about Russia and Ukraine, as well as sanctions.\n\n\"Being a businessman, he understands too well that these sanctions are harmful -- not just for the Russian economy, they are also harmful for the European economy and for the American economy,\" said Nikonov.\n\n \n\n\"Sanctions depend on the United States,\" he added. \"If America has a will to lift sanctions, they will be lifted by the European Union the next day.\"\n\nIn another move that would counter international consensus, Trump has said he'd like to move the US Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, to Jerusalem. Previous US administrations and other countries have avoided such a shift because the disputed city isn't internationally recognized as the capital of the Jewish state.\nIn a video address to Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told him that he's \"a great friend of Israel, over the years you've expressed your support consistently, and I deeply appreciate it. I look forward to working with you to advance security, prosperity and peace.\"\n\nTrump has also said America's Arab allies will have to do \"the fighting\" in conflicts in Syria and Iraq, blasting Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar for \"not doing much\" at an August rally in Virginia. \"The Gulf states have nothing but money,\" Trump said. \"I'm going to get them to pay.\"\n\nIn Asia, Trump has suggested he'd make serious changes. He is open to a major departure from current policy by talking to North Korea to push them to halt their nuclear program, a possibility that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said wouldn't succeed.\n\nPyongyang wants to be recognized as an equal to the US and seeks talks to demonstrate that. The Obama administration won't consider engaging with the government of Kim Jong Un until North Korea starts denuclearizing.\n\n\"I would speak to him,\" Trump told Reuters in May. \"I would have no problem speaking to him.\"\n\nTrump has also voiced frustration about post-World War II alliances with South Korea and Japan, saying that the two don't contribute enough to their collective security agreement. In March, he suggested that the US could pull back and more seriously arm the two countries so they could better defend themselves.\n\n\"Right now, we're protecting, we're basically protecting Japan,\" Trump told the New York Times. \"And there'll be a point at which we're just not going to be able to do it anymore.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.6003430485725401, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1069, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.06354484339, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 46, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161110010000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 4.30308699719364, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/16/opinions/michelle-obama-future-filipovic/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "How Michelle Obama threw us a lifeline", "wordcount_as_scraped": 569, "date": "20161217000000", "story_content": "Michelle Obama said something stunning this week: Discussing the election of Donald Trump, she told Oprah Winfrey, in a clip that aired Friday on CBS, \"We are feeling what not having hope feels like.\" \n\n Welcome to the club.\n\n For many women across the United States, Mrs. Obama occupies a similar role to that of Ms. Winfrey: a widely admired, deeply trusted and well-liked figure who has broken barriers without breaking down the ways so many of us relate to her. \n\nObama is careful and polished, but her public persona is less meticulously measured than that of her husband, the President. She is the rare American figure who is both aspirational and relatable.\n\n \n\nSo when she asks, \"What else do you have if you don't have hope?\" in a moment when so many Americans have expressed hopelessness at the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency -- worried sick about a President-elect who ran a campaign infused with  embitterment, misogyny, and racism, who seems happy to disregard some of our nation's oldest democratic norms and who may have been helped along by Russian interference -- she's telling us that she's walking this scary path right along with us.\n\n \n\nPerversely, hearing Mrs. Obama talk has made me the most hopeful I've felt since Election Day.\n\n \n\nHere's why: As First Lady, she had to play according to conservative, conformist rules, and as the country's first African-American First Lady, she had to take extra care to maintain an image of sophistication and excellence. \n\n \n\nOnce her husband is out of the White House, she'll be significantly freer -- to speak her mind, pursue her own passions and advocate for the things she believes in. \n\nMichelle Obama has been clear she doesn't have electoral ambitions, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's going to retreat from the worlds of politics and advocacy. She is, after all, a brilliant and ambitious woman with years of notable work under her belt, from her years in private legal practice, to her work in the public sector, to running a nonprofit, to working in academia.\n\n \n\nHer biography has naturally been overshadowed by the President's, but Michelle Obama's life has been one of hard work and substantial accomplishment, much of it in the service of making the world \u2014 certainly her community -- a better place. \n\n \n\nWhat she'll do next is still a question mark. Perhaps it'll be something in the health universe, along the lines of her \"Let's Move\" program promoting child and adolescent health. And maybe now she'll have the ability to go bolder -- her ambitions to change the American food system were thwarted by corporate food interests that have immense influence in Congress. Even what she could say in public seemed inhibited by her husband's position. \n\nWhen she's no longer the First Lady, perhaps we'll see her taking a louder and more forceful stand.\n\n \n\nOr maybe we'll see her embrace the important issues long neglected by prominent politicians. I would personally love to see her promote abortion rights, which have been deemed too controversial for full-throated advocacy from many middle-of-the road Democrats, or maternal health -- African American women, after all, continue to die during pregnancy or childbirth in astounding and shameful numbers, and their plight has been largely ignored by the political establishment. \n\n \n\nPerhaps like Michelle Obama, I've spent the past month in what feels like a bottomless well of hopelessness.

The cause of the blaze remains under investigation.\n\nNevertheless, the city received repeated complaints over the years about the warehouse-turned-art space, a dilapidated two-story structure at 1315 31st Ave., and its adjacent lot.\n\nThe site had become cluttered with old cars, oil containers, pests and trash, according to those complaints.\n\nMany of the complaints were directed at the lot, pointing to a \"ton of garbage piling up on the property\" as well as the \"illegal interior building structure\" at the warehouse, according to city records released this week. \n\nThe most recent complaints were filed three weeks before Friday's fire.\n\n\"I am disappointed that we weren't more assertive and aggressive to deal with that property,\" said Gallo, the councilman whose district includes the Ghost Ship.\n\nGallo cited budget cuts that resulted in layoffs of firefighters, fire marshals, building inspectors and police officers in the wake of the financial crisis as one reason for the apparent lack of scrutiny.\n\nBut he said there was also a disconnect between complaints reported to the city through his council office and the handling of those complaints.\n\n \"We turn (them) in,\" Gallo said. \"But we can't tell staff what to do and how to do it.\"\n\n He said he's been shocked by what's he's learned in the wake of the deadly blaze.\n\n\"Minute by minute, we're discovering these things that have been going on -- and not been going on -- for all these years,\" he said.\n\nGallo said there had been a deluge of calls and email complaining about similar situations since the fire.\n\n\"How many of these types of operations do we have throughout the city?\" Gallo asked. \"No one can tell me.\"\n\n He said the problem stemmed in part from skyrocketing rents pushing young people out of nearby San Francisco to look for affordable housing across the bay.  \"We're a sanctuary,\" he said.\n\nHe said the City Council was going to instruct city administrators to come up with a plan for determining how many other problem properties are out there and how much additional staffing will be required to ensure they come up to code. \n\n\"We need to get our act together,\" he said.\n\nGallo said the city was in part to blame for the problem, but that property owners bore some responsibility as well.\n\n\"I'm a homeowner.

His appointment schedule is right on time and you might not like his choices but they make sense. They have so far been a rejection of the \"team of rivals\" approach associated with Obama and modeled on Lincoln's administration.\n\nTrump is happy to flirt with former opponents like Mitt Romney, whose name is being floated for Secretary of State, but the words \"loyalty\" and \"coherence\" are more important to him -- which is probably what he should be looking for.\n\nMuch of the apparently improvised nature of the transition likely comes down to an expectation of defeat. Presidential candidates who believe they are going to win often plan their potential cabinets well in advance. Trump had to throw together an organization more or less overnight. So it's significant that his first serious moves were essentially about White House management, something that many President-elects leave until later. Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon have been swiftly elevated to chief of staff and chief strategist. Chris Christie is out.\n\nHaving righted the ship, Trump has moved on to policy portfolios. Recent presidents have used the transition period to send messages about the kind of administration they want to run. Bill Clinton chose a cabinet that looked like America, full of female and minority faces, and which stressed economic experience. Trump's preferences are different. Take Wilbur Ross, one name mentioned for commerce, whose background eerily matches Trump's own. A billionaire who has helped failing coal and steel industries; a critic of free trade. And, like many potential cabinet members, an early and enthusiastic Trump backer. \n\nBut the biggest emphasis in Trump's nominations is on national security. He clearly respects tough-minded men who are unafraid of defying Washington in the name of defending America from its enemies. Army Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, a possible National Security Adviser, took on Obama. Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis (tipped for defense secretary) is blunt; he criticized the Iran deal. \n\nKansas Rep. Mike Pompeo (CIA) hounded Hillary Clinton over Benghazi. Far from representing an isolationist revolution in foreign and military policy, the new administration will likely maintain an active role in the world, and give America's security agencies its full support. This is a pity because dovishness was one of Trump's most attractive qualities in the election.\n\nSo perhaps it's no surprise that Mitt Romney, an old-fashioned hawk, showed up at Trump's door to discuss, reportedly, the Secretary of State post. This would be a coup for Trump. To put on his team a man who is hugely respected and yet also an outspoken rival could look like he is reaching out. \n\nThis is another thing that many President-elects have tried to do. Obama kept Bush appointee Robert Gates on at defense and made Hillary Clinton, his constant critic in the primaries, Secretary of State. Moreover, Romney is strongly associated with opposition to Moscow -- it was he who tried to put Russian hegemonic ambitions on the election agenda in 2012. \n\nSome fear that Mike Flynn is too friendly with Putin, so Romney would add some nice balance. Jimmy Carter went for a similar model when he appointed two very different men, Cyrus Vance and Zbigniew Brzezinski, as Secretary of State and National Security Adviser in the 1970s.\n\nBut that relationship was frayed and eventually counterproductive. So, too, might be appointing Romney. Trump leads from the top, and he has made it clear in the last few weeks that he sees a grand alliance between Russia and America as the best solution to the crisis in Syria. If Trump taps Romney, then he risks creating dissension within the administration. If Romney accepted such a role, he would damage his own integrity. \n\nThen again, leaving Romney out in the cold might allow an alternative political court to grow that fosters Republican criticism of the new administration. In other words, how Trump handles his conservative opposition is going to be just as important as how he deals with the Democrats. Democratic rebellion is expected and many votes will dismiss it as mere partisanship. But Romney, or the Bush family, have the capacity to create truly damaging headlines.\n\nAnd if the cabinet is entirely made up of conservative Republicans with Trumpish tendencies, Trump leaves himself open to criticism from a GOP establishment that, since the surprise victory, has been otherwise happy to assent to his leadership. \n\nFor all this, the transition is actually going quite smoothly. Most presidents aim to have it done by Christmas and Trump is way ahead of that. It's unlikely that a Republican Congress will block any appointments -- even Jeff Sessions for attorney general, troubled by accusations of racism, will likely sail through. Any heat seems to be cannily generated by Trump himself, via Twitter. His war with the cast of Hamilton feels like a brilliantly choreographed distraction from, among other things, his selection process.\n\nDoes Trump want to construct consensus in Washington or push forth aggressively with his own agenda? Perhaps that's a silly question. Expect a cabinet that largely does as it's told.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.65198242664337, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 851, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.49627822141, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161121220000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.4077555816686202, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/09/politics/ohio-abortion-bills/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1132, "scraper_regex": 1210}}, "headline": "Ohio passes 2nd bill restricting abortions; both await Kasich's signature", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1210, "date": "20161209200000", "story_content": "Ohio lawmakers for the second time this week have passed a bill that would restrict abortions, the latest of which would ban the procedure after 20 weeks' gestation.\n\nThe state's current law generally bans abortions after a fetus has begun its 20th week of gestation, unless a doctor determines that the fetus isn't viable outside the womb. Exceptions are made if the pregnancy puts the woman's health at serious risk.\n\nThe latest measure, Senate Bill 127, would eliminate the viability test and simply ban abortions past 20 weeks. The woman's-health exception would still apply.\n\nGov. John Kasich will now have before him that measure, which passed Thursday, and the \"Heartbeat Bill,\" which passed on Tuesday. The \"Heartbeat Bill\" aims to ban abortions from the moment the heartbeat of a fetus can be detected -- which usually occurs about six weeks into a pregnancy.\n\nSome Ohio legislators criticized the latest measure. \n\n\"It's not about the babies; it's about the attack on women,\" Democratic Rep. Teresa Fedor said.\n\nFedor proposed an amendment to SB 127 that would have made an exception for victims of rape and incest. But the amendment failed, and the House passed the bill Thursday with a 64-29 vote. \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio said SB 127 would harm Ohio women. The bill would prevent those \"who are facing the difficult decision to terminate a wanted pregnancy from receiving the care they need in our state,\" the group said in a statement published on its website.\n\nThe law \"would effectively eliminate all options for women without the financial resources to travel for abortion care,\" the ACLU said. \n\nIn a statement, Iris E. Harvey, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio, said: \"For the second time in a week, the Ohio Legislature has inserted itself into women's private and personal health care decisions.\"\n\n\"These bans are a deliberate attempt to make abortion illegal in the state of Ohio,\" she said. \"If signed into law, these bills would force women to travel long distances and cross state lines to access abortion. For many women, the expense and time these restrictions would force upon them would make access impossible.\"\n\nPassed in the lame duck period \n\nOnce the new bills reach Kasich, he will have 10 days to decide whether to sign or veto them. A veto would stop a bill unless three-fifths of the state House and Senate vote for an override.\n\nThe bills were proposed at the end of the state's House session -- known as the \"lame-duck\" period. \n\n\"A hallmark of lame duck is a flood of bills, including bills inside of bills,\" Kasich press secretary Emmalee Kalmbach told CNN,  referring to a larger child abuse bill within which the \"Heartbeat Bill\" is contained. \"We will closely examine everything we receive.\"\n\nConsensus to move forward \n\nDonald Trump's election, and a presumption that he'll appoint conservative Supreme Court justices, spurred Ohio Republicans to pass the \"Heartbeat Bill,\" which would effectively be the nation's strictest time-based abortion law, according to a legislator. \n\nState legislators had considered the bill in previous years but it never passed the Senate. \n\n\"One, a new President, new Supreme Court justice appointees change the dynamic, and that there was a consensus in our caucus to move forward,\" Ohio Senate President Keith Faber, a Republican from Celina, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nAsked if he thought the bill would survive a legal challenge, he said: \"I think it has a better chance than it did before.\"\n\nShould either bill become law, a court battle likely would ensue. The ACLU of Ohio already has said it would press a legal challenge. \n\nHow does this compare to other states' laws?\n\nForty-three states currently restrict abortions, with some exceptions, by time or phase of fetal development. \n\nSome of those states prohibit abortions after a doctor determines the fetus is viable. There's no fixed time period in such laws, but the nonprofit American Pregnancy Association says that viability generally can begin as soon as 24 weeks.\n\nOther states prohibit abortion after a certain time following conception -- as soon as 20 weeks in some states.\n\nBecause heartbeats develop at around six weeks, Ohio's \"Heartbeat Bill\" appears to offer what would be the country's shortest window for abortions.\n\nAt least two other states -- Arkansas and North Dakota -- passed fetal heartbeat abortion laws. But those measures were found to be unconstitutional in federal court.\n\nWhere does Kasich stand on abortion?\n\nKalmbach, a former Ohio Right to Life staffer, said previously the governor does not typically comment on pending legislation. \n\nEarlier this year, Kasich told CNN that he was \"pro-life with the exceptions of rape, incest and the life of the mother.\"\n\nKasich signed the state's current viability restriction in 2011. \n\nAnd earlier this year, Kasich signed a bill to ban the state from contracting for health services with any organization that performs or promotes abortions -- a measure widely seen as a way to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe Columbus Dispatch and the Cleveland Plain Dealer have reported that Kasich expressed concerns about previous attempts to pass a \"Heartbeat Bill,\" including that it may not withstand legal challenges. \n\nMike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, has said his group is neutral on the heartbeat bill because it doesn't believe the measure would hold up in federal court.\n\n\"We believe in an incremental approach,\" Gonidakis has said. \"When you overreach, sometimes the courts get the last say. There's a reason why no state has a 'Heartbeat Bill' yet.\"\n\nGonidakis previously said he believes the 20-week bill has a greater chance of surviving court challenges, in part because other states have such a restriction.\n\n'Expensive lawsuits'\n\nThe ACLU of Ohio tweeted this week: \"Just a reminder, if the unconstitutional #HeartBeatBill passes and becomes law, we will challenge it in court.\"\n\n#stopthebans #ohgovxmas @ProChoiceOH @WHOohio @OhioRCRC pic.twitter.com/djlNG0aStF\u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPAOhio) December 7, 2016\n\nOhio state Sen. Joe Schiavoni, a Democrat from Boardman, said that the heartbeat bill would lead to \"expensive lawsuits\" that would divert resources away from more pressing issues like the opioid crisis.\n\n\"To the taxpayers of Ohio, I am sorry that your money will have to be used to defend this bill in the court system.\"\n\nJohn Fortney, a spokesman for the Senate's Republican caucus, has said that \"as far as the threat of abortion advocates suing, we don't base our decisions on protecting the lives of babies on the threat of someone threatening to file a lawsuit.\"\n\nTrump and the Supreme Court\n\nPresident-elect Trump has expressed interest in reversing the 1973 Roe v. Wade landmark decision that made abortion legal nationwide.\n\nTrump will get to nominate at least one justice during his term to fill the seat vacated by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. Scalia was known for dissenting opinions on abortion rights.\n\nIn an interview with \"60 Minutes\" last month, Trump said opposition to abortion would be a criteria for nominating justices.\n\n\"The judges will be pro-life,\" he said.\n\nBut replacing Scalia with someone of the same mold alone may not change the status quo. In June, the Supreme Court ruled 5-3 against a Texas abortion access law that opponents argued would have shut down all but a handful of clinics, with perennial swing-vote Justice Anthony Kennedy joining the court's four liberal justices.

This region is home to the second largest and more diverse concentration of Latinos in Florida after Miami and the southern part of the state where Cuban Americans are the majority.\n\n\"We have people from about 15 cultures in our congregation,\" says Yoan Hechavarria, the head of this church, who said Ministerio Daytona is part of a much larger church based in Jacksonville.\n\nAnd while politics are not part of the pastor's sermon, Hechavarria admits the presidential election is part of the conversation before and after the service.\n\n\"We have an obligation to be in tune and to be informed about the politics of our country,\" Hechavarria says.\n\nRELATED: These Americans would live in the shadow of a Trump wall\n\nAround 2 million Latinos are registered registered to vote in Florida, according to a study by the City University Of New York commissioned by CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. The study adds that Latinos will cast about 20% of the votes in that state on November 8, and that some 500,000 of those votes will come from the I-4 corridor.\n\nThe number of evangelical Latinos is rising. A report by Pew Research Center found in 2013 that 16% of Latinos identify as evangelicals an increase from 2010 when only 13% did according to the CUNY study.\n\nThat growth would be good news for the GOP who generally speaking enjoys the backing of the religious right. In 2006, the Republican Party enjoyed a lead among Latino voters in Florida. Back then 37% of the Latino electorate was registered as Republican. \n\nThis year Republican affiliation has dropped to 26% compared to almost 39% registered as Democrats and 33% registered as independent.\n\nRELATED: Political Prediction Market: Clinton's chances for the White House dip\n\nBut the conservative values championed by the Republican Party that appeal to evangelicals could be lost this year by the party's nominee for president. Hechavarria adds that his church members are confused because neither presidential candidate offers them a clear choice.\n\n\"As Christians we are usually more inclined to follow the Republican party, but Donald Trump doesn't seem to represent our values,\" Hechavarria says, adding that while he thinks Hillary Clinton seems to be qualified to occupy the White House, her views on social issues are not aligned with his, particularly on abortion and same-sex marriage issues.\n\nHarry de Jesus, an army veteran who worships at Ministerio Apostolico, says national security and veteran's care are top priorities for him in choosing a president and thinks Trump would be better at handling them, but he rejects the offensive comments Trump has made about woman and immigrants. \n\n\"As the father of a girls I can't condone him,\" he says.\n\nBut Clinton should not see De Jesus' rejection of Trump as a vote for her. He says that besides disagreeing with her on abortion and same-sex marriage, he didn't find her to be honest even before she ran for president. \n\nReality Check: Trump on Clinton allowing abortions 'in the 9th month, on the final day'\n\n\"She is hiding a lot behind the curtains,\" he said.\n\nSamuel Peinand, who also attends Ministerio Apostolico, also finds Clinton to be dishonest but is willing to give her a chance.\n\n\"I am inclined to vote for her because of her experience, not her ideas,\" he said.\n\nRELATED: Bracing for the final stretch\n\nBut not everybody is rejecting Trump.

America's shock, and its grief for the more than 2,000 US military dead on this date of \"infamy\" led to overwhelming unity of purpose as we entered a world war.\n\nYet America's unity was matched by its profound fears about national security in the days after Pearl Harbor. Well before December 7, 1941, Americans believed that enemy spies and saboteurs lived among us. Some did, though not nearly as many as we imagined. In 1940, the FBI reportedly received 3,000 complaints or tips every day regarding acts against America's national defense.  \n\nAmid this climate of fear, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover ordered the Immigration and Naturalization Service to detain and question thousands suspected of having ties to America's enemies. Many Germans and Italians were arrested in the days after Pearl Harbor, but the American people's fear of \"persons of Japanese ancestry\" hardened the most.\n\nIn the months after the attack, the US government acted decisively on these fears, physically relocating more than 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry, more than two-thirds of whom were American citizens, to 10 inland camps across Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Many more temporary detention centers and assembly centers dotted the American landscape in 1942. \n\nAlthough administered by an agency called the War Relocation Authority -- and referred to by the government as \"relocation centers\" -- these were American concentration camps.\n\nAmerican congressmen used the term themselves. In January 1942, Republican Leland Ford of California suggested to Hoover and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox \"that all Japanese, whether citizens or not, be placed in inland concentration camps.\"  Ford was not alone. On February 18, his Democratic colleague John E. Rankin of Mississippi took the floor of the US House of Representatives and announced: \"I am for catching every Japanese in America, Alaska, and Hawaii now and putting him in concentration camps.\"\n\nThe day after Rankin spoke on the House floor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 authorizing relocation. The order did not mention Japanese-Americans specifically, nor did it use the term \"concentration camps.\" It did, however, claim that the \"successful prosecution of the war requires every possible protection against espionage and against sabotage.\" The order permitted the government to exclude people from prescribed areas. The forced relocation of \"persons of Japanese ancestry\" soon began. Thousands of Japanese-Americans lost their jobs, homes and liberty.\n\nOne month after FDR's order, a public opinion poll revealed that 93% of Americans thought we were \"doing the right thing\" in moving \"Japanese aliens\" from the Pacific coast. \n\nJapanese-Americans used their country's legal system to fight back. At least 12 challenges to curfew, evacuation and detention orders made it to the courts during the war. Four of these cases reached the US Supreme Court. In each case, the courts concluded that the war powers of Congress and the President justified the acts. \n\nEven as the Supreme Court sided with the US government in a 1943 case, Associate Justice Frank Murphy noted in a concurring opinion that \"restriction of the personal liberty of citizens ... bears a melancholy resemblance to the treatment accorded to members of the Jewish race in Germany and in other parts of Europe.\" Murphy warned that sanctioning discrimination on the basis of ancestry \"goes to the very brink of constitutional power,\" though he rationalized that \"conditions of great emergency\" indeed justified the government's actions.\n\nSome of the clearest thinking in response to ginned-up fears about internal enemies came from African-Americans, who were at the same time waging their own campaigns with federal authorities to integrate the US Army and defense industries.\n\nIn September 1942, the NAACP's magazine, The Crisis, ran an article titled \"Americans In Concentration Camps,\" which courageously noted that \"Color seems to be the only reason why thousands of American citizens of Japanese ancestry are in concentration camps. Anyway, there are no Italian-American or German-American citizens in such camps.\" \n\nIn fact, approximately 11,500 people of German ancestry and 3,000 people of Italian ancestry -- many of them citizens -- were detained at some point during the war. But this was not a comprehensive removal program, as experienced by people of Japanese ancestry.\n\nToday, there is little doubt that The Crisis was correct to put prejudice at the center of this egregious violation of rights. By summer 1942, after the Battle of the Midway, the possibility of internal sabotage on the Pacific Coast diminished. Officials in the War Department knew that relocation was no longer necessary because the threat of air raids or invasion had nearly vanished. Yet the government stuck to its relocation policy for another three years. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan offered a formal apology and redress of $20,000 to every living survivor of these camps.\n\nOn this anniversary, we should not forget the service of 16 million troops and millions more Americans on the home front who made great sacrifices to win the war. Nor should we create false equivalencies between the forced removal of Japanese-Americans and the vast web of concentration and death camps that enabled the genocide of Europe's Jews. Yet, we do a disservice to this solemn day if we fail to acknowledge the way a climate of fear enabled the US government to identify, demonize and incarcerate its own citizens in American concentration camps.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.951115608215329, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 848, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 11, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.4736314862800004, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 39, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207120000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.5990566037735805, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.54545454545}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/opinions/europe-follows-trump-right-andelman/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [731], "\u00e7": [586, 3337]}}, "headline": "Europe follows Trump to the right", "wordcount_as_scraped": 900, "date": "20161129190000", "story_content": "As Donald Trump nears his choice for secretary of state, one of the first orders of business for the successful candidate will be grappling with instability from the populist revolution emerging across the Atlantic, upheaval similar to that which propelled Trump to power -- a sudden and powerful lurch toward the right. This restlessness presents both potential opportunities and peril for the next president of the United States -- and those who would carry out his vision.\n\nOn Sunday, French Republicans overwhelmingly threw their support behind Fran\u00e7ois Fillon as their party's candidate for next year's presidential election. Fillon easily beat conservative rival and Bordeaux Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 for the right to face the Socialist Party and far-right National Front party leader Marine Le Pen in the first round of the presidential contest in April. But whether or not it is, as seems likely, the center-right or the far-right that claims the French presidency, the leaders of Russia and the United States will likely have an enthusiastic ally in their corner.\n\nFillon has, as Le Monde noted, played billiards with the Russian autocrat at his summer retreat in Sochi when the two were prime ministers of their respective nations. Putin, meanwhile, has used the kind of language to describe Fillon that many thought reserved for the US President-elect. \n\nIn the case of Le Pen, Russia's state-controlled RT quoted the French presidential hopeful as suggesting that an alliance between her country, Russia and the United States \"would be good for world peace.\"\n\nPerhaps. Either way, the stakes for all three nations are enormous, including for the Trump administration. After all, Donald Trump and the new European right-wing apparently share a skepticism of a solid NATO alliance, a united European Union and the regime of sanctions that have hamstrung Russia.\n\nThe danger of course, is that with the United States and France both leaning toward cutting Russia some slack and lifting some of the more debilitating embargoes, this might encourage an emboldened Putin to seize any opportunity to achieve his seeming goal of reassembling the Soviet empire, whose demise he has long mourned.\n\nBut the victory of Fillon suggests an even broader problem the Trump administration must confront -- that Europe itself is fragmenting. Marine Le Pen has indicated that one of the core planks of her campaign is to join Britain in an outright withdrawal from the European Union, which would threaten the euro as a continent-wide single currency. And above all, of course, she has pledged to shut France's frontiers to Middle East immigrants. \n\nOn the surface, this should sound quite congenial to Trump. But careful. Every nation that joins Britain in withdrawing from a united Europe means one more set of tariffs that needs to be negotiated with the United States. Should a French withdrawal embolden similar movements from Denmark to the Netherlands to Austria, even Italy, the entire European system could crumble and with it would arrive a host of new tariff barriers.\n\nBut such practical considerations may not deter French voters, many of whom have, like much of Europe and a substantial chunk of the American electorate, pretty much had it with the left. The popularity of incumbent French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has fallen to a record low of 4%, leaving many of his fellow Socialist party members to hope desperately he won't throw his hat in the ring for a second term.\n\nAgainst this tumultuous backdrop, Fillon wants to seize this opportunity for France to assume its place as a world leader (or, at least, as leader of the European continent). But Fillon is not the only one whose fate will be decided at the polls in the coming months. Indeed, early next month, Italy's charismatic, center-left Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has placed his political future on the line for a constitutional reform referendum that many see as likely to be defeated in the face of determined opposition. That opposition has come from two Trump-like figures: brash comedian Beppe Grillo and anti-migrant extremist Matteo Salvini, photographed recently in a rolled-up shirt, smiling and boogying with Marine Le Pen in Milan. A \"no\" vote could mean an abrupt end to Renzi's government. \n\nBut an even more imminent challenge to the European project could be the victory of the far-right in Austria's presidential election later this week. There, right-wing candidate Norbert Hofer has taken an anti-immigrant page from the Trump campaign's playbook, chastising his leading opponent for criticizing the American leader: \"It is not clever to describe a president as a rabble rouser.\" \n\nAll this suggests that the incoming Trump administration could quickly be confronted with potentially the greatest social, political and economic transformation in generations as European politics realign. It would mark a seismic shift in the world order, one that America needs to handle adroitly. \n\nHow should the incoming Trump administration respond to all this? Well, choosing a secretary of state that has the full and clear trust and backing of the President, and signaling a commitment at the highest levels of the administration to holding together a fragmenting NATO alliance and European continent, would be a welcome start. \n\nSuch moves would go a long way to assuring America's place in the world going forward, and would encourage a stable and prosperous transition to a new world that is dominated by a re-energized political right.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher, and President-elect Trump cannot act too soon.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.620475709438324, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 887, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.6974584301, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161129190000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.0439684329199506, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/10/opinions/rafsanjani-seyed-hossein-mousavian/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Death of Iran's Rafsanjani: Ex-president was a man of peace", "wordcount_as_scraped": 794, "date": "20170111030000", "story_content": "The news of the sudden passing of Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has utterly shocked Iranians of all walks of life. \n\nThe prominent statesman had been involved in public life going back to his youth during the Shah's dictatorial regime, when he was a leading activist and endured years of prison, torture, and exile. \n\nAfter the success of the Iranian revolution in 1979 and the return of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to the country, Rafsanjani emerged as the closest aide and confidant to the revolutionary father and would play an instrumental role in managing the country under his leadership. \n\nCentrist leader\n\nAfter Saddam Hussein's Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, Rafsanjani juggled serving as speaker of parliament and a top war commander for eight years. He also played a decisive role in ending the conflict as he made sure Iran held its head up high even when virtually every global and regional power had supported Saddam. \n\nAfter the war, he initiated a massive reconstruction program to rebuild the country during his two terms as president between 1989 and 1997. \n\nWhen Rafsanjani was elected president, Iran was also gripped by political polarization and radicalism among its leftist and rightist political factions. He set on championing the idea of moderation as a guiding philosophy in foreign and domestic policy and fought to entrench centrism in Iranian politics -- a cause to which he remained dedicated to till his last day. \n\nI knew Ayatollah Rafsfanjani for over 30 years. I experienced firsthand how he always emphasized the importance of relations with Eastern countries such as China, Russia, and India, while at the same time ceaselessly endeavoring to improve Iran's ties with the West and decrease US-Iran tensions. \n\nAkbar Hashemi Rafsanjani: the man who mirrored an ever-changing Iran\n\nRelations with the West\n\nDespite American support for Saddam, Rafsanjani was receptive to President George HW Bush's promise that \"goodwill begets goodwill\". \n\nWhen Washington and European officials appealed to Iran to help release Western hostages trapped in Lebanon between 1982 and 1992, Rafsanjani delivered. He dispatched Mahmoud Vaezi -- now minister of communication -- and myself to engage in diplomacy that ultimately secured the release of all European and American hostages. \n\nBush, however, would not follow through on his promise and reciprocate the goodwill gesture. Despite this, Rafsanjani persisted and in 1995 offered Iran's first oil contract to a foreign firm since the revolution to the US company Conoco. Valued at over $1 billion, the contract would fall victim to an executive order by then President Bill Clinton barring it and other similar investments in Iran. \n\nRafsanjani also made every effort during his presidency to improve Iran's relations with Europe and its Arab neighbors. \n\nIn one meeting, then-German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and I discussed with Rafsanjani options for developing friendlier ties with the Persian Gulf states. Rafsanjani told Genscher that Tehran supported the establishment of a security and cooperation system among Persian Gulf countries similar to the EU. Genscher was elated and said he would notify Washington. A short while later he informed us in private that Washington opposed the idea.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1997, I served as Iran's Ambassador to Germany. The German chancellor at the time, Helmut Kohl, was eager to defuse tensions between Iran and the US. Rafsanjani welcomed Kohl's efforts and informed him that Iran was ready for cooperation on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, combating terrorism, and safeguarding human rights. \n\nWith great hope, Kohl travelled to Washington to notify US officials. Some weeks later, I was told by the chancellor's office that that Kohl had spoken with President Clinton, who strongly opposed the entire initiative. \n\nModerator\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah\u2014who was effectively already running the country as his brother's health was ailing\u2014reached out to Rafsanjani and suggested talks. Saudi-Iran ties had vastly deteriorated due to Saudi support for Saddam in the Iran-Iraq War. \n\nAlongside a son of Rafsanjani, I traveled to Riyadh and negotiated for days with the Crown Prince. The result was a series of agreements that maintained amicable ties between the two countries from 1997 until President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election in 2005. \n\nRafsanjani was a man of peace and cooperation in foreign policy and of construction and development in Iran. He worked to build a modern, progressive nation true to its history and religion while remaining at peace with its neighbors. \n\nHis most significant legacy, however, will be of ingraining a mindset of moderation and aversion to radicalism in Iran and the region. While many in the West did not comprehend this in his time, costing him dearly politically, he passed the torch to a new generation in Tehran, making it still possible to right past wrongs and reach the breakthroughs he long fought for but never lived to see.

On November 2, Yau and Leung were dragged from LegCo by security guards as they found themselves at the center of a legal battle that threatens to undermine the city's already shaky political system. \n\nOathgate\n\nThe saga began as lawmakers were taking their oaths of office last month. While pro-democracy politicians have used the ceremony as a venue for protest in the past, Yau and Leung took it a step further. \n\nThey swore and insulted China and displayed flags with the words \"Hong Kong is not China,\" leading to their oaths being rejected, along with several other lawmakers who flubbed their vows. \n\nThe pair were due to retake their oaths properly the following week when everything got a lot more complicated. Hong Kong government officials sued to prevent them being sworn-in again, arguing they had forgone their opportunity. \n\nBefore the court could rule, Beijing too waded in, using a rarely-used power to re-interpret Hong Kong's constitution. \n\nYau and Leung could not retake their oaths, and would not become lawmakers, Beijing said. This was later backed up by a Hong Kong court, though the pair are appealing. \n\n\"We were elected by over 50,000 voters,\" Leung said, adding that he was fighting to \"protect our system and the separation of powers and the rule of law.\" \n\nYau defended the pair's protest as a tradition, pointing to occasions in the past where other lawmakers used the oath-taking session \"for a performance or chance to show their ideologies.\" \n\nDisplaying the flags was just a statement of fact, Leung added, \"Hong Kong is not China.\" \n\nThey would not comment on the content of their oaths, due to the ongoing appeal.\n\nWhat's at stake?\n\nBeijing's ruling came as a shock to much of Hong Kong. \n\nLast week, wearing black and led by a marshal holding a black umbrella, more than 2,000 lawyers marched on the city's top court, in a silent demonstration against what they saw was a blow to the city's judicial autonomy. \n\n\"This is treachery on behalf of the (Chinese government) to the Hong Kong people. How can they ever trust them again?\" said Alan Leong, a former barrister and co-founder of the pro-democracy Civic Party, adding that Beijing's ruling was \"completely unnecessary.\" \n\nThe fear is that Beijing's interpretation, which requires officials to pledge allegiance to Hong Kong as an inalienable part of China, will undermine judicial independence and the \"one country, two systems\" principle under which the city is governed. \n\n\"By preventing the two pro-independence politicians from taking office, the Chinese government has opened the door to disqualify anyone from Hong Kong's government if they are determined to not be loyal to Beijing,\" pro-democrat lawmaker Claudia Mo wrote in an op-ed after the ruling. \n\nSome fear that Beijing is also indicating a willingness to change the constitution at will. Before the most recent interpretation, the power had only been used four times in the past 19 years.\n\nWhy did Beijing act?\n\nThe oath-taking saga comes amid increasing support in Hong Kong for independence from China, which has caused concern and outrage in Beijing. \n\nIn the run-up to the LegCo elections in September, several pro-independence candidates were banned from taking part, including Edward Leung (no relation to Baggio), then the city's most famous separatist politician. \n\nYau and Leung's actions \"hit the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle and posed a grave threat to national sovereignty and security,\" China's top lawmaking body said in a statement this month.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said last week that \"pro-independence forces in Hong Kong want to split the nation.\" \n\nLeung accused his and Yau's critics of \"blaming the victim,\" and argued that it is Beijing which has fostered support for independence through its heavy-handed actions.\n\n\"They're the ones who caused a generation of Hong Kongers to think that 'one country, two systems,' isn't working,\" he said. \n\nYau added that people should recognize the arrangement is \"a failed experiment, no country would choose to rule a city in this way.\" \n\nIf Hong Kong does not become independent, she said, then it is just the same as any other Chinese city. \n\nDivided city\n\nDespite widespread outrage over Beijing's intervention, including mass protests, Yau and Leung have also come in for a whirlwind of criticism, even from anti-Beijing quarters. \n\nChinese state media said that it was \"the will and demand of the entire population of China\" that the pair be ejected, and pro-Beijing groups staged a protest against them holding signs such as \"Yau and Leung get out of China.\" \n\nWhile other pro-democrat lawmakers have largely stood in solidarity with the pair, outside LegCo reaction has been decidedly mixed, with some supporters even expressing frustration over Yau and Leung's actions. \n\n\"The most prevalent sentiment is that Yau and Leung have overplayed their hands -- and rather unnecessarily so,\" said Jason Ng, a lawyer and author of \"Umbrellas in Bloom: Hong Kong's occupy movement uncovered.\" \n\n\"By doing what they did, they have not only damaged their own political careers, but they have also jeopardized those of other anti-establishment lawmakers.\" \n\nIntense criticism\n\nWhile Yau and Leung said they are determined to keep fighting to the end (the case has not yet reached Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal), it is clear events are taking their toll. \n\nLeung said he was moved to tears reading an article quoting his election volunteers' despair and dejection after months of work to get him his seat was wasted.\n\n\"Most Hong Kongers are sympathetic to us,\" Yau said. At times however, criticism has turned personal. \n\nThe youngest woman ever elected to LegCo, Yau has frequently been the target of offensive and sexist comments, and at a protest last month pro-Beijing groups displayed a naked sex doll with her face on it.\n\nWhile Yau denied that her gender has been a factor, she said the criticism has made her family worry for her safety.  \n\nParaphrasing a song lyric by Canto-rock singer Candy Lo, Leung said he could handle being \"abandoned by the world\" so long as he had something to love. \n\n\"Hong Kong is like a sinking ship,\" he said, but one he hoped to save.

But while the response to her comments is welcome, the incident is about so much more than a message that sounded like it came directly from the Ku Klux Klan. \n\nWhile the actual date of the so-called sermon is unclear, the video went viral this week, just days before she was scheduled to appear on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" hosted by one of the most visible \"homosexual spirits\" on the planet. \n\n\"Everybody in this room who's filled with the homosexual spirit, beg God to free you,\" Burrell ranted in the video. \"You play with it. What does that mean? You'll die from it. You play with it in God's house in 2017, you'll die from it.\" \n\nHow Christ-like of her.\n\nFollowing an epic backlash on social media, Burrell released an asinine apology for, and defense of, her ugly message on a Facebook Live. \"I never said God was killing gays in 2017. I said people who operate with that spirit in the church, with deception and attached themselves, are going to have to face the master. That's what I said, and death is attached to their behavior,\" she said. \n\nShe also blamed the reaction for her alleged sermon on \"the enemy\" being at work. \n\nBurrell is clearly terrified her \"business of church\" will be affected by the media firestorm. After all, the church is a corporation -- one that doesn't pay taxes -- and appearing on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" would no doubt give her business a boost. \n\nBut according to reports Tuesday, Burrell won't get a chance to put her soul on the auction block for a boost in sales for her single with Pharrell Williams, \"I See a Victory.\" DeGeneres reportedly canceled her appearance. Ironically, the song -- which Burrell was scheduled to perform on the show -- is from the movie \"Hidden Figures,\" which stars Jim Parsons, an openly gay actor, and Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Monae, all of whom have been advocates for \"homosexual spirits.\"\n\nBurrell, it seems, is happy to benefit from \"homosexual spirits\" even while damning them to hell. \n\nIn her Facebook Live defense, Burrell trotted out a familiar argument.\n\n\"To every person that is dealing with the homosexual spirit -- that has it -- I love you because God loves you. But God hates the sin,\" Burrell said. But as Dr. Kenneth Samuel explained in my documentary \"Holler If You Hear Me: Black and Gay in the Church,\" \"That doesn't make sense, because if you love the person, you love all of them. You say that you hate the sin but you love the sinner. It's impossible because you are talking about a person who cannot separate him or herself from the body that they are in.\" \n\nYet this isn't really about Burrell, who wasn't born with unbiblical bigotry. Instead, her mindset is a hate that has been passed down from the pulpit, by church leaders who endorse a doctrine that is caging people's souls, ruining their ability to love and placing them in an entanglement of self-hate.\n\nAs James Baldwin once said, \"Because I was born in a Christian culture, I never considered myself to be totally a free human being.\" This brand of theological violence represents everything that is wrong with the church, specifically the African-American church. And while homophobia in religion is by no means exclusive to the black church, there is something unique going on: The black church could not function without the LGBT community. \n\nI have always said, if you want to meet a whole bunch of black gay folks, just go to a black church. From the choir to the pastors, the LGBT community has been serving the black church since the African-American church existed. But this anti-love language is why so many black queer youths are suicidal; why would you not take your life if you believe you will burn in the lake of fire? Hateful language from so-called faith leaders is partly why some 50% of black men who have sex with men are at risk of becoming HIV-positive; why would you not protect yourself with a condom if you are taught you are an abomination?\n\nThere is blood on the hands of many black churches. \n\nBut why would Burrell or church leaders listen to a commoner like me, one with a homosexual spirit? They won't, but the backlash is a promising step in a loving direction. \n\nThis is not an assault on conservative Christians. Instead, this is a call for a panoramic view into the structural underpinnings of the use of religion as a tool of oppression. Sure, not everyone who is anti-gay or opposes equal rights for LGBT people is hateful. But those who follow the supercult of religion have no idea they are being fed microwaved soul food. \n\nSpiritual development unfolds and regenerates itself in various ways through different periods of human existence and cultures, but the current construct of religion is a spiritual mini-mall. Nothing handcrafted, just an assembly line of reversible, matching little outfits for the spirit, attaching shame to the human potential for spiritual ascendance and transcendence. \n\nI thank God for the response to Kim Burrell. Ten years ago, she could have made these comments and her offering plate would overflow. But such rhetoric is no longer as marketable -- and, at the end of the biblical day, pastors want to make tax-free money. So, in 2017, hypocrites will not get a pass on discrimination by using the name of Jesus. You will not use the LGBT community while calling for their death.

Dean Heller, along with Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas -- two senators who lost out to Trump in the primary race for the Republican nomination last year.\n\n\"Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state of Israel, and that's where America's embassy belongs,\" Rubio said in a joint statement announcing the bill. \n\n\"It's time for Congress and the President-elect to eliminate the loophole that has allowed presidents in both parties to ignore US law and delay our embassy's rightful relocation to Jerusalem for over two decades.\"\n\nCruz added: \"Unfortunately, the Obama administration's vendetta against the Jewish state has been so vicious that to even utter this simple truth -- let alone the reality that Jerusalem is the appropriate venue for the American embassy in Israel -- is shocking in some circles.\"\n\nThe bill, called the \"Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act,\" requires the US to act on a 1995 proposal calling on the US to relocate the diplomatic mission from Tel Aviv. \n\nSince the 1995 bill's passage, every president -- both Republican and Democrat -- has waived the requirement of the move, citing national security considerations.\n\nThe Jerusalem question\n\nJerusalem has always been among the most difficult questions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even after the world recognized the State of Israel in 1948, it left the final status of Jerusalem -- home to some of the most sacred sites in Judaism, Islam, and Christianity -- open to future negotiations. \n\nIsraelis see Jerusalem as their united capital. Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\n\nTrump has said he'd like to try making peace between Israelis and Palestinians, but he's also vowed to relocate the embassy and recognize Jerusalem as Israel's official capital -- moves Palestinian leaders have denounced as the death of the \"two-state\" solution.\n\nTrump's pick for ambassador to Israel -- David Friedman, a New York lawyer and Orthodox Jew -- is another signal the President-elect is willing to upend decades of US policy in the Middle East. \n\nFriedman, known for his hardline views, has called the effort to find a two-state solution an \"illusion\" and said he welcomed moving the embassy.\n\nFriedman has also argued that Israeli settlement construction in Palestinian areas shouldn't be illegal -- a position that puts him at odds with the outgoing Obama administration and much of the international community. \n\nTensions over settlements\n\nThe US and most other nations consider Israel's construction of new housing tracts in the West Bank and East Jerusalem -- lands Palestinians see as part of their future state -- as an obstacle to the hopes of a \"two-state\" solution between Israelis and Palestinians. \n\nFor years the US has pleaded unsuccessfully with Israel to stop building new settlements. But in December, relations between the two countries sunk to a new low after the US allowed a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning settlement construction to be adopted. \n\nThe resolution -- which passed because the US, which holds veto power, abstained from voting -- says the construction of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.\"\n\nAs to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\u2014 Donald J.

We could not just keep away without coming to say farewell to our dear brother, farewell revolutionary.\"\n\nA partner in liberation\n\nAs the Cold War seeped onto African shores in the 1950s, it was Castro's revolutionary ideas that inspired liberation leaders on the continent.\n\nFreedom fighters saw similarities in their struggle, a seeming David and Goliath story of a small group trying to stand up against an outsized enemy, whether it be the United States, as in the case of Cuba, or the grip of colonizing powers, as in Africa.\n\n\u202fAfrica was in need of friends, and while western leaders largely ignored the independence struggle, Fidel Castro did not.\n\nSouth Africa's Nelson Mandela spoke of approaching the United States government for assistance during the nation's anti-apartheid struggles, only to be refused.\n\n\"But Cuba, the moment we appealed for assistance they were ready to do so and they did so,\" Mandela is quoted as saying during a 1990 documentary.\n\n\"Why would we now listen to the Western world when they say we should have nothing to do with Cuba? It's just unreasonable.\"\n\nCuban soldiers in African world\n\nCastro's influence on African independence movements went beyond revolutionary thought. He backed it up with manpower.\n\nAcross the continent, Castro provided arms and training to guerrilla movements.\n\nIt was Castro who came to Angola's assistance in 1975 by sending 36,000 Cubans to resist the South Africans, despite opposition from its ally, the Soviet Union. Thousands of Cuban soldiers died and drained Cuba's economy in a war with no obvious military victory in what became known as \"South Africa's Vietnam\".\n\nThe stalemate, however, inspired a resurgence of resistance to colonial power in Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, in large part due to Castro's stance.\n\nIn the mid-1960's it was Castro's instruction to Che Guevara that had the Cuban doctor fighting alongside the socialist Lumumba loyalists in the Democratic Republic of Congo as they tried to remove the US-backed Mobutu regime.\n\nCastro's move to \"Cubanise\" African independence struggles did not go unnoticed, and served to further isolate Castro's Cuba from the West in the height of the Cold War.\n\nHowever, for many Africans, there was no finer proof of solidarity than the willingness of Cubans to lay down their lives for African freedom. And in Castro, many Africans found a lifelong comrade.\n\nAn outsize influence\n\nSigns of the tiny Caribbean island's influence on the vast African continent remain.\n\nWithin days of the Ebola crisis two years ago, it was Cuba which sent the largest contingent of international doctors in West Africa in those frightening first days of the outbreak.\n\nIn South Sudan's capital of Juba there's a community known as 'Cuban Jubans,' refugees fleeing civil war, who found education and shelter in Cuba before returning home.\n\nIn remote regions of South Africa, you may come across a Cuban doctor. And from Ghana to Namibia, many more African doctors were trained by Cubans. More than a\u202fthousand South African medical\u202fstudents also travel to\u202fCuba every year.\u202f\n\nMandela showed his appreciation by traveling to Havana soon after his release after 27 years behind bars. And when Africa's most loved president found himself being inaugurated as South Africa's first black President, Castro was in attendance. Mandela called him \"a source of inspiration to all freedom loving people.\"\n\nAnd when President Obama shook Raul Castro's hand for the first time, arguably setting in motion the thawing of diplomatic relations, he did it at Nelson Mandela's funeral on African soil.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.4531043767929097, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 686, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.3868974564, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6443148688046603, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/16/travel/womens-skis/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 543, "scraper_regex": 583}}, "headline": "Beyond 'pinking it': Women's skis evolve", "wordcount_as_scraped": 583, "date": "20161216180000", "story_content": "For a long time, women's skis suffered from a phenomenon known as \"pink it and shrink it\": take a men's model, make it shorter (and softer) and give it a pastel topsheet.\n\nIn the late 1980s, K2 described its LTP as \"a ladies' top performer, very flexible and smooth,\" while reassuring potential customers that \"the graphics on the LTP are beautiful and coordinate extremely well with the latest colors and fashions.\" \n\nAnd that company actually was a pioneer in the women's market! In the 1990s it even named a line, the T:9, after Title IX, a US law prohibiting sex discrimination.\n\n\"For several years we were the only company with skis designed from the ground up for women,\" says Adam Ruscitto, K2's product line manager.\n\nImportant demographic\n\nThankfully we've come a long way since. The offerings have improved and last season the best-selling ski in specialty shops was the Black Pearl from Blizzard -- the first time a women's ski had ever topped the overall list. \n\nAnother first was when Head started using its proprietary material Graphene in its unisex line after introducing it in the Joy line for women (usually, innovations are R&D'ed for men's skis then applied to women's skis).\n\nOne of the reasons for this evolution is catering to a demographic with renewed importance to the industry. \n\nSisters on the slopes: The rise of women's ski camps\n\n\"Overall there are far fewer skis sold internationally than there were 10 or 15 years ago,\" says Jackson Hogen, who works at a snowsports store in Reno, Nevada, and edits the review site Realskiers. \"But one segment is responding: the recreational woman skier.\"\n\n\"There are some women who don't take ownership of their outdoor experiences, so there needs to be a product line that attracts them,\" says Tricia Pugliese, who co-runs Pugski and works at a store at the Tahoe resort of Northstar. \n\n\"In a perfect world companies would be able to market according to what ski is best for the person, whether it's a small guy or a big woman. \n\n\"But we don't live in a perfect world so we need a market that says, 'This is a women's ski, it's going to be soft and easy for you to initiate a turn while you're learning. Then as you move up you can go to a stiffer ski that holds up stronger once you've initiated the turn.'\"\n\nMore options and a refreshing irreverence\n\nIn Lake Tahoe, Jen Gurecki took matters into her own hands and three years ago introduced Coalition Snow, the only women's ski and snowboard manufacturer in the US.\n\n\"An expert woman could purchase a men's ski, but wouldn't you want to have more options?\" Gurecki says. \"You can also choose to support businesses that are overtly pro-women. All of that aside, we make f----ng good skis!\" \n\nMeanwhile, the big brands are doubling down. A year ago, Blizzard and its sister boot company, Tecnica, started the Women to Women project, which will unveil its debut collection next year. \n\n\"We've held multiple global women's focus groups, as well as done surveys and on-snow scientific research into the stance and balance point while on skis,\" says Leslie Baker-Brown, marketing manager at Blizzard. \n\nFocus groups aside, a measure of refreshing irreverence remains in the industry. One of Armada's most popular skis is the JJ, and its women's version is called ... the VJJ. \n\n\"Armada was just having fun and guess what?

For the first time in memory, this is no longer an academic question.  \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has questioned why the United States invests so much in these security partnerships when it seemingly receives so little in return. \n\nBy either abandoning or neglecting commitments, or seeking to shake down allies for better deals, a Trump administration might lead us to a world without robust US security alliances -- the very foundation of the \"globalist\" American posture many Trump supporters disparage. And that would be an extremely high-risk gamble.  \n\nOur recent book, \"America Abroad,\" examines what a world without US alliances would look like; we conclude that a large-scale pullback would serve America's interests only if four assumptions are true.\n\nMore nuclear states\n\nFirst, you have to believe that the spread of nuclear weapons will occur in a responsible way, with all the new nuclear weapons states building up the kinds of survivable forces that have little risk of accidents and miscalculations.  \n\nMake no mistake -- there will be many new nuclear states. Trump has mused that it might actually be good if allies currently under the US security umbrella were to seek nuclear deterrents. But proliferation would not stop there: Alarmed neighbors would almost certainly follow suit.\n\nCould we count on new nuclear powers to secure their forces, to make sure they do not get into the wrong hands and are subject to reliable control in a crisis? Reams of scholarship says no. To take one example: Pakistan has built what scholars say is a highly unstable hair-trigger nuclear arsenal, and is mainly responsible for proliferating nuclear capability to North Korea.  \n\nA world without US security guarantees risks more such states, with the attendant risks of nuclear war and leakage to hostile nonstate actors.\n\nArms races and risk of war\n\nSecond, you have to believe that decreased security abroad will not make the United States less secure. Removing US security guarantees clearly makes allies less secure, and that fear will drive arms races and risk war. Just think about what happens if we were to stop underwriting Japan's security -- given the historical animosities involved, what happens when Japan responds on its own to China's growing military power, how do Beijing and other regional powers react, and so on? \n\nRegions engulfed in rivalry, arms racing, crises and possibly armed conflict would escalate the challenges of dealing with the security problems of today while also generating new ones.\n\nThink addressing threats such as ISIS and al Qaeda is hard now? Try dealing with those issues if Europe and Asia were also destabilized and themselves generating different and possibly even more challenging threats.\n\nWar costs everyone\n\nThird, you have to believe that instability and war abroad will not affect prosperity at home. There is little doubt that war and instability \"over there\" would affect prosperity here. To believe otherwise, you have to believe that US firms and investors can somehow avoid being harmed by the turbulence in the markets that would inevitably follow conflicts overseas.  \n\nAcademic studies debunk that belief for what it is: a relic of your grandfather's world economy (back when financial markets were not tied together in an elaborate web and when vast swaths of American firms were not highly reliant on overseas plants, research facilities and suppliers as they are now).\n\nAlliances take hard work; why put that to waste?\n\nFourth, you have to believe that the United States can create coalitions on an ad hoc, as-needed basis. But alliances of the kind the United States now possesses can't just be assembled the moment Washington faces a crisis and wants help from other states.\n\nUS alliances are deeply institutionalized relationships, reflecting complicated bargains that cannot be reduced to a zero-sum \"who gets what?\" real estate transaction. Their construction in the early Cold War took immense efforts, and conditions were uniquely favorable: The United States produced some 40% of global output, Europe and Asia lay wrecked from the world war, and America and its partners faced the overpowering need to contain the threat of Soviet power.\n\nConsider, also, how few and unreliable Russia's and China's long-term allies are. Moscow can often depend on Belarus and it may have a loyal partner in Bashar al-Assad's Damascus. For its part, China has North Korea. Would they like to have more? Sure, but building up alliances is hard to do -- something to ponder before putting current US alliances on the chopping block.\n\nTo think that pulling back will go well for America requires confidence that many other important things would work out right: that global oil prices will always quickly stabilize if a conflict emerges in major oil-producing region; that maintaining the openness of the sea lanes will not be made more difficult and perilous; that abandoning alliances with the world's leading economies will not sap the US ability to prevent the global economic order it constructed after World War II from being changed in ways damaging to America's interests; that inter-state cooperation on all sorts of other issues, from terrorism to global crime to the environment, will work just as well without the leverage the United States gains from its alliances.  \n\nHaving reviewed the relevant scholarship, it's hard to find any basis for optimism on how these issues would pan out.        \n\nThere are good reasons most national security experts condemned loose talk about US alliances being \"obsolete\": The world that would emerge in their absence would be much more dangerous.

The names of the now-defected foreign fighters in this story have been changed to protect their identities.\n\nAnother former jihadi said the wedge being driven between Muslims living in the West and their governments is exactly what ISIS wants. \n\n\"[Trump's] helped ISIS a lot, he's basically being a tool for them in a way,\" Abu Obaida, a British former Jabhat al-Nusra fighter in Syria, told CNN via direct message. \"On social media right now there's a lot of people quoting Anwar al-Awlaki (the late spokesperson for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) and his last speech when he said that America will turn on the Muslims.\"\n\nJihadist sympathizers hail Trump's ban on social media\n\nAs Obaida indicated, sympathizers of Islamist militant groups are already hailing Trump's ban online.\n\nIn conversation on social media, various jihadists have said the executive action unveiled America's \"hatred towards Muslims,\" according to US-based SITE monitoring service. A pro-ISIS account on Telegram -- an encrypted app favored by the militant group -- praised Trump as \"the best caller to Islam,\" signaling the President's ban would attract new believers. \n\n\"When US President Donald Trump says 'We don't want them here' and bans the Muslim immigrants from Muslim countries, there is one thing that comes to our mind,\" stated one account on Facebook, sharing an image of Awlaki, who was killed in a 2011 US drone strike in Yemen, with his quote.\n\nCharlie Winter, senior fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at King's College London, who has studied ISIS propaganda for years, told CNN he has not yet seen the ban appear in official releases from the militant group. But Winter said the policy is \"far more potent than any video or other piece of propaganda\" the group could put out.\n\n\"He's a caricature of the evil crusader that they want to convince everyone exists,\" Winter said.\n\nTrump has already featured briefly in at least two propaganda videos released by ISIS, as well as one clip published by the Somali terrorist group al-Shabaab. President Obama was also shown in similar videos.\n\n'Sweet music' to ears of Islamist militants\n\nIt's not just ISIS that might capitalize on the ban, al Qaeda is likely to use it, too. \n\n\"By banning Muslims, lumping them with radical Islamism, Donald Trump provides ammunition and motivation for al Qaeda and ISIS,\" said Fawaz Gerges, chairman of contemporary Middle East studies at the London School of Economics and author of \"ISIS: A History.\" \n\nGerges said that to group more than 1 billion Muslims with Islamic extremists is \"foolishly counterproductive\" to the battle against ISIS.\n\nTrump has said this is not a Muslim ban. Responding to the outcry over the executive order, the President wrote: \"This is not about religion -- this is about terror and keeping our country safe.\"\n\nBut Gerges said Trump has provided ideological inspiration to ISIS, and also contributed to deepening anti-American sentiments throughout the Muslim world.\n\n\"The policy can easily be interpreted, and is being interpreted, as a ban against Muslims,\" Gerges said. \"If you are serious about defeating ISIS, the last thing you want to do is portray the fight as Islam vs. the West.\"\n\nIn the years since 9/11, the Bush and Obama administrations were careful not to mix up a \"war on terror\" with a war with Islam. But the Trump team put the fight against \"radical Islamic terrorism\" at the heart of its campaign. This, paired with Trump's previous calls for a \"Muslim registry,\" set the stage for the President's travel ban.\n\nClint Watts, a former FBI counterterrorism special agent and US Army infantry officer, said, as a result of Trump's rhetoric, the US administration will have a harder time partnering with Muslim-majority countries in the region to fight ISIS and other terror groups.\n\n\"This isn't an isolated policy. Moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Calls for bringing back torture. All of these in combination amplify the rhetoric,\" Watts said. \"Not only are we increasing recruitment, but we're making it harder for our partners around the world to fight with us against terrorism.\"\n\nA lifeline for ISIS\n\nBy most accounts, Trump entered office to a diminished ISIS threat. A survey by IHS Conflict Monitor released earlier this month suggested the group has lost nearly a quarter of its territory in Iraq and Syria last year alone, and more than a third since its peak. Its finances have also taken a hit and 180 \"senior\" leaders have been taken out by airstrikes, according to the US-led coalition.\n\nIraqi-led forces trying to retake Mosul from ISIS have made significant gains since launching the offensive late last year.\n\nGOP Sen. John McCain blasted Trump's executive order in an interview with CBS on Sunday, saying he was worried about how the ban would be received in Iraq, where American forces are fighting alongside Iraqi troops to retake Mosul from ISIS.\n\nMcCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, added that the ban would only \"give ISIS some more propaganda.\"  \n\n\"The Islamic State is on the back foot militarily, it's losing territory. This kind of action more than makes up for that,\" Winter said. \"Even if ISIS loses Mosul and Raqqa, the ideology will live on because of statements like these, policies like these.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.0696516036987305, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 920, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.26982493302, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170130210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.02173913043478, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/10/politics/donald-trump-transition-drain-the-swamp/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Team Trump is already filled with Washington insiders", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1075, "date": "20161111140000", "story_content": "To shape his administration, President-elect Donald Trump is drawing squarely from the \"swamp\" he has pledged to drain.\n\nTrump's transition team is staffed with long-time Washington experts and lobbyists from K Street, think tanks and political offices. \n\nIt's a far cry from Trump's campaign, which ended only Tuesday night, and message that he would \"drain the swamp\" in Washington. He has advocated congressional term limits and proposed a \"five-point plan for ethics reform\" that included strengthening restrictions on lobbying, including five-year bans for members and staff of the executive branch and Congress from lobbying, and expanding the definition of lobbyist to prevent more revolving door activity.\n\nBut he has so far fully embraced lobbyists within his transition, and all signs point to a heavy influence from longtime Washington Republican circles on his transition. And with Trump mostly skipping detailed policy proposals during his campaign, they can have a powerful impact on his agenda. \n\nLeaders in his transition include former Rep. Mike Rogers, former Reagan Attorney General and Heritage Foundation fellow Edwin Meese, former President of Heritage Edwin Feulner, former Bush administration official and lobbyist Christine Ciccone, former Dick Cheney adviser Ado Machida, former Senate Budget Committee staffer Eric Ueland and Sen. Jeff Sessions' former chief of staff Rick Dearborn. The effort is chaired by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Trump counts former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sessions as close advisers.  \n\nLower level staffers assigned with crafting different departments are also heavily drawn from K Street, the center of lobbying in Washington, and congressional staff, according to a staff organizational chart obtained by CNN.  \n\nWelcome to Trump's America\n\nSources close to the operation say Sessions and the conservative Heritage Foundation have had a strong role in shaping the transition, in addition to staffers from the Bush administration, K Street and Capitol Hill.\n\nAt a Heritage Foundation event Thursday, John Yoo, a Berkeley Law professor and scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, got a warm reception from the crowd by cracking about the closeness.\n\n\"I'm surprised there are so many people here because I thought everyone at Heritage was working over at transition headquarters,\" Yoo said on the panel about Trump's win. \"I asked the taxi cab driver to take me to Trump transition headquarters and he dropped me off here, instead.\"\n\nThe crowd let out an appreciative laugh. \n\nInsiders seek to sway Trump's policy direction\n\nTrump's policy is likely to be shaped largely by Republican stalwarts. Trump's policy positions throughout the election have been thinner than traditional campaigns, and he has made contradictory statements at times or has changed his state policy goals amid criticism. \n\nMeese told CNN that in general, the transition is going \"very well,\" and suspected the heavy involvement from key Heritage personnel shows that his think tank will have a strong influence on Trump. With Trump having less experience in some areas of policy, he will have to draw on others' expertise to craft his positions, Meese said.\n\nEarly in the transition process, staff including Chairman Chris Christie held a series of meetings on K Street in Washington with different industry groups and key lobbyists. \n\nSources in those meetings said the conversations were top level, but when asked about specific policies, the transition team signaled they would be open to input from K Street.\n\nIn one financial services meeting, an attendee asked about Trump's past positions on reinstating Glass-Steagall, legislation that regulated banks. While the GOP platform called for reinstating Glass-Steagall and Trump's campaign manager at the time promoted it, Christie told the financial services lobbyists gathered that Trump is often open to changing his mind when he gets input from people with expertise. \n\nTrump meets with Obama at the White House\n\nLobbyists around Washington feel that the Trump administration could be heavily influenced by their input, as his campaign's policy positions were considerably thinner than Hillary Clinton's, and some of his promises could be open to interpretation.\n\nIt also helps K Street that the Republican Party is far from united on policy. Establishment Republicans and allies of House Speaker Paul Ryan expect Ryan's \"Better Way\" agenda to drive much of Trump's administration, as Ryan has been working to promote it for years in the House and has even toured the country touting it.\n\nBut social conservatives and farther right Republicans like the Heritage circle have seen hope in Trump's campaign promises and closeness with Sessions -- signaling hard-line positions on immigration and social issues. \n\nFighting with K Street to fill jobs\n\nBoth sides are trying to influence his policy development and have representation on the transition team. Trump's Cabinet appointments could signal which way he's leaning. \n\nA senior aide to Vice President-elect Mike Pence said that the former congressman would have a strong role in Trump's administration working with Congress and on legislation. But the aide also said that the transition would have to find people outside of Washington to staff the administration. \n\n\"This campaign was an outsider campaign. It would be foolish to go ahead and place a whole bunch of DC insiders into roles, right?\" the adviser said. \"So it'll be a mix.\"\n\nTrump is also competing with lobbying shops themselves for some of the top talent in Washington. Having prepared mostly for a Hillary Clinton presidency, Washington had been hiring Democratic talent. After Trump's surprising win, K Street is also trying to staff up with the best GOP policy staff from Capitol Hill and around DC.  \n\nJames Wallner, group vice president of research at Heritage, said he is encouraged that Trump will heed the recommendations of his organization for two reasons. One is that their ideals line up with many of his campaign promises, and two is that Heritage has made an effort to craft all of their recommendations in an easy-to-use manner.   \n\n\"You don't have time to digest a huge tome of material to have some moment of enlightenment to say, 'Oh I've figured out how to solve our health care problem.' You really need actionable type information that you can then process and make up your own mind on how to proceed and how to advise people to proceed,\" Wallner said. \"As long as President-elect Trump appoints people to this administration that are going to do things that are consistent with the promises he made while campaigning for this office that the American people clearly supported, then I'm optimistic about where we're going.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.19047617912292, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1029, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.50160669205, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161111140000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.23517978620019, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/opinions/europe-handing-putin-a-win/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e7": [2371, 2454]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 791, "scraper_regex": 861}}, "headline": "Europe is handing Putin a win -- and Trump a headache", "wordcount_as_scraped": 861, "date": "20161205140000", "story_content": "It was a split decision for moderation in Europe on Sunday, but the balance seemed to tip toward a new fragility for an already endangered European Union -- not to mention a further victory for Vladimir Putin.\n\n \n\nIn two critical national ballots, Austrian voters dealt a surprise defeat to the far-right candidate for the symbolic post of president, only to be followed by a stunning rebuke for Italy's stylish 41-year-old center-left Prime Minister. \n\n \n\nIn Italy, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi staked his leadership, and perhaps the country's membership of the EU, on a constitutional amendment to free the nation from the stranglehold of legislative paralysis. He lost. \n\n \n\nThe winners turned out to be two populist leaders -- comedian-turned-politician Beppo Grillo, who seized on Donald Trump's \"drain-the-swamp\" chant. \"Our movement has some similarities,\" he boasted. \"We became the first political movement in Italy, and the media didn't even realize it.\" \n\nThe other Italian exulting in the victory over Renzi is the equally anti-EU, right-wing politico Matteo Salvini, whose Northern League supporters delighted in holding up photos of their beaming standard-bearer next to Trump.\n\nRelated: Italy's PM Matteo Renzi to resign\n\nSweeping populism?\n\n \n\nSunday's referendum was just the latest blow dealt by the potent forces of populism that seem to be sweeping across the continent, taking special encouragement from Trump's surprise victory last month. \n\n \n\nAll share, too, a stunning affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who can only be exulting in his attraction to the expanding forces of opposition to the EU in a growing number of EU nations. \n\nLast month, Salvini, who's expressed interest in becoming prime minister of Italy, paid his fourth visit to Moscow. \n\nHe'd already curried favor with Putin after becoming one of the first European politicians to visit Crimea after Russia had seized it. \n\n \n\nThough a right-wing victory in Austria would have seen a clean sweep for Putin and against EU unity, Italy -- the third largest economy in Europe, after Germany and France -- is by far the bigger prize. \n\n \n\nThis weekend's balloting is only the first crest of a wave expected across Europe in the first half of next year.\n\n \n\nThe first victim, last week, was France's socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who took himself out of the running for re-election, days after Fran\u00e7ois Fillon swept to victory in France's Republican primary. Either Fillon, or the extreme right-wing National Front leader, Marine Le Pen, now seem poised to seize power in that country next spring.\n\nBoth have trumpeted their friendship with Putin -- Fillon boasting of the billiards he played with Putin in his Sochi villa, Le Pen pledging she'll cozy up to both Putin and Trump in the \"interest of world peace.\" She's already been photographed by Italian paparazzi boogying with Salvini.\n\n \n\nBoth Fillon and Le Pen have expressed their skepticism of the value of France remaining in the European Union, while Grillo has called at a minimum for an exit from the eurozone currency system. \n\n \n\nFurther high-stakes voting will come thick, fast and furious in the new year. Next March, Dutch voters will vote for a new parliament and hence prime minister, with Geert Wilders' far-right, anti-Islamic and anti-immigrant Party for Freedom leading in some polls.\n\nMerkel's challenge\n\n \n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has already announced she'll stand for a fourth term next fall, but faces a strong challenge from the potent right-wing Alternative for Germany party, a close ally of France's National Front and Britain's pro-Brexit UKIP. \n\nAlternative party leader Frauke Petry sent one of the early messages of congratulations received by Trump after his victory, and an equally confirmed tweeter, she quickly put out a claim that \"this night changes the USA, Europe and the world.\" The party's leadership has also not hesitated to line up behind Putin.\n\n \n\nA multitude of forces are bolstering the populist movements taking hold in Europe. Anti-immigrant, anti-Islamic feelings are paramount in many member states. Returning economic power to the people is another issue driving this anti-EU surge.\n\n \n\nWithout question, the populist movements in each European country are subtly and often bizarrely different. But most share a common thread: skepticism over the value being returned to the people of their country by a bloated EU bureaucracy, and a desire to capitalize on overtures from Putin and the new Trump regime, which all seem to be espousing similar values.\n\n \n\nA headache for Trump?\n\nWith Trump's victory, a model for most of these new-wave populists, the President-elect leader must take particular care as to how he deals with these potent new forces. \n\n \n\nHaving already endorsed Brexit even before the surprise vote by Britain to leave the European Union, a full-scale dissolution of the EU could prove catastrophic for US interests.\n\nNegotiating individual tariff agreements with 28 nations in Europe, while facing similar challenges in broad swaths of Asia after opting out of the Trans Pacific Partnership and threatening to pull out of NAFTA in North America, could leave America's trade position in a shambles.\n\nAt the same time, giving a carte blanche to Putin for further adventures on the fringes of Europe and the Russian periphery can provoke critical challenges to a NATO alliance that is already, in some European circles, feeling endangered as well.\n\n ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.26146793365479, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 1, "wordcount": 791, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.24992053304, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.7926675094816695, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/north-carolina-voter-rolls/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "The man who helped purge thousands from voter rolls in North Carolina", "wordcount_as_scraped": 865, "date": "20161105150000", "story_content": "As Donald Trump warns of a \"rigged\" system fueled by voter fraud and other irregularities, some private citizens have taken it upon themselves to protect the nation from what they see as the potential for a stolen election.\n\nMichael Hyers, an Air Force retiree from Fayetteville, North Carolina, has spent hours upon hours combing through records, cross-checking addresses and submitting thousands of challenges to voter registrations in an effort to purge voter rolls at the local Cumberland County elections board. He claims to have removed 6,000 people from voter rolls since 2014.\n\nHe believes it is his duty. \n\n\"I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution,\" Hyers told CNN, explaining his belief that Democrats have conspired to commit massive voter fraud and he has a responsibility to scrub rolls of voters who have died or moved away.\n\nThe challenges submitted by Hyers and his group, the Voter Integrity Project, a conservative organization that believes systemic voter fraud exists, became part of a federal lawsuit that accused officials in three North Carolina counties of illegal voter-roll purges that disproportionately targeted African-Americans.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the NAACP, garnered the attention of the Justice Department and independent elections-monitoring groups, and on Friday, a federal judge ordered the state and local boards to restore the purged voters.\n\nFederal judge Loretta Biggs described the purges as a \"flawed process\" and specifically noted that one individual in Cumberland County -- where Hyers lives -- challenged the registration of approximately 4,000 local voters.\n\nThe North Carolina Board of Elections has no evidence the election will be affected by fraud, and in a statement to CNN, a spokesperson said the board works to ensure the integrity of the elections process by investigating allegations, conducting audits during the early voting period and working in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nStudies have found limited occurrences of voter fraud, such as a 2014 report by Rutgers University political science professor Lorraine Minnite, who concluded, \"The scant evidence of arrests, indictments or convictions for any of the practices defined as voter fraud means that little fraud is being committed relative to the millions of votes cast each year in state, local and federal elections.\"\n\nBut Hyers says he has come across news reports and hearsay to the contrary.\n\nHe also specifically references videos produced by James O'Keefe, the conservative political activist, and his organization, Project Veritas, which shows Democratic operatives purportedly discussing questionable methods to skew the election against Trump. Most of those videos have been found to be inaccurate and highly edited to promote O'Keefe's conservative narrative.\n\nHyers told CNN this has led him to painstakingly research voter records for names and addresses of individuals he says have not voted in two or more federal elections. \n\nHe then mails letters to those individuals' addresses that explain how his group has determined they may be inactive and urges them to re-register or face possible challenges to their voting status.\n\nIf the letter comes back to Hyers with the marking \"return to sender,\" he says he files a challenge regardless of the voter's race or political affiliation.\n\n\"The system is broken,\" Hyers said. \"(The law) was written by the Democrats in such a way as to keep the rolls bloated, so that voter fraud could be done.\"\n\nJay DeLancy, who co-organized the Voter Integrity Project in 2011, said his group depends on people like Hyers to do the work that he says official elections boards can't.\n\n\"We know that there is some level of voter impersonation fraud going on, but it's not prosecutable unless you catch the person in the act, which is impossible to do because there's no ID required,\" Delancy told CNN.\n\nMultiple county officials did not to respond to CNN's request for comment regarding how they proceed when private residents such as Hyers challenge registered individuals' eligibility to vote.\n\nBut in the eyes of Jimmy Buxton, who heads the Fayetteville chapter of the NAACP, all of this amounts to politically motivated voter suppression.\n\nBuxton said some individuals such as Hyers and others have found a way to side-step the official process of election boards to examine the accuracy of voter rolls since North Carolina law allows private citizens to submit residency challenges.\n\nBuxton said this allows non-government groups to suppress the votes of African Americans, who more often align with Democrats.\n\n\"It's undercover racism,\" Buxton said.\n\nThe North Carolina branch of the NAACP filed suit to challenge the en masse cancellations on the grounds that the National Voter Registration Act prohibits systemic voter removal programs within 90 days of a federal election. The suit also charged that the efforts disproportionately targeted African-Americans.\n\nIn a statement of interest in the case, the Justice Department wrote, \"the purge program at issue here rested on a mass mailing and the silence of voters largely unaware of the potential injury to their voting rights.\" The DOJ also has sent election monitors to at least one North Carolina county, Robeson County.\n\nThe judge's ruling on the case Friday orders the election boards to stop further purges and ensure that voters have the right to vote in person or receive an absentee ballot if they had been denied.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.68227434158325, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 847, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.29788311768, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161105150000, "PurityVirtue": 3, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 4.13223140495868, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/22/travel/vietnam-by-motorcycle/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [3869], "\u00e0": [1840], "\u00ea": [1846]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1303, "scraper_regex": 1391}}, "headline": "Vietnam by motorcycle: History and culture on two wheels", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1391, "date": "20161223000000", "story_content": "Vietnam is a nation that moves on two wheels.\n\nA 200,000-kilometer road network connects cities with farming villages, beach resorts to mountain escapes and dense jungles to a jagged coastline.\n\nOver 37 million scooters snake their way from the Mekong Delta in the south to the snow-dusted peaks on the Chinese border. It's the favored mode of transport for the 90 million people that call Vietnam home, and tourists are catching on.\n\nThe country sees almost 8 million visitors every year, and recently a new type of traveler has started arriving -- motorcyclists.\n\nA popular tourist route connecting Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City has developed, with riders seeking history and culture to accompany adventure. \n\nMechanic shops and backpacker hostels now fix and flip bikes by the hundreds to fearless foreigners.\n\nIntrigued, I ended up in Vietnam with my own two wheels. \n\nWith no time frame and a curious desire to explore, I rode 10,000 kilometers. Here are a few of the highlights I experienced along the way. \n\nIn search of the perfect ride\n\nHanoi, the bustling capital, is the beginning for most motorcyclists in Vietnam. \n\nSome riders seek out the services of reputable companies like Flamingo Travel, Cuong's Motorcycle Adventures and FlipSide Tours, while young backpackers scour the streets in search of cheap, Chinese-built bikes.\n\nBut while many purchase a motorcycle and head directly south, those in the know head north, aiming for Vietnam's majestic mountains.\n\nMORE: The ultimate Vespa city tour\n\nVietnam's majestic north\n\nOffering an idyllic farming lifestyle, peaceful Mai Chau is an enchanting first stop on the northern loop before continuing towards the golden rice terraces in Nghia Loa, Than Uyen and Sapa.\n\nHome to the country's highest summit and gateway to the Ho\u00e0ng Li\u00ean Son mountain range, Sapa has been a tourist hotspot for years. \n\nMost riders find themselves here for at least a night to experience cultural home stays with the Hmong people.\n\nFarther north, the real adventure begins, with a ride to Ha Giang via the ethnic markets in Bac Ha. Sizable Ha Giang is the entrance to the Dong Van Karst Geopark, a mountainous landscape on the border of China that requires special permits to visit.\n\nArguably the most exquisite terrain in the entire country, the drive to Dong Van and onwards to Bao Lac is home to 17 minority groups, beehive-like peaks and the deepest canyon in Southeast Asia, Ma Pi Leng.\n\nTemperatures can plummet in these mountains and the rough roads can leave the body bruised and shaken, but the discomfort is canceled out by the thrill of experiencing Vietnam's most epic panoramas. \n\nMORE: Northern cruising: A journey up Vietnam's Red River\n\nBeyond the caves of Phong Nha\n\nSome 560 kilometers south of Hanoi lies a cave system that has kick-started the development of tourism in a region that was once one of the poorest in the nation. \n\nPhong Nha-Ke Bang National Park is best known for the recent discovery of the largest cave in the world, Hang Son Doong, and adventurers have since been flocking to the park and its bucolic village Phong Nha in droves. \n\nBut there is more to the town than just the colossal caves.\n\nSet between glorious rice paddies and stunning karst mountains, Phong Nha and its amicable locals are so captivating that I decided to hang up my helmet and call it home for three months after first riding through. \n\nThe \"Cave Kingdom\" has gone from relative obscurity to being one of the most visited tourist destinations in all of Southeast Asia.

Collectively known as the Ho Chi Minh Trails, they were an entire system of hidden transport routes that crossed through the jungles, over borders and even out to sea.\n\nToday, the sealed Ho Chi Minh Highway follows the inland passage through some of the country's deepest jungle. \n\nMost motorcyclists choose to follow this route, and the Western Ho Chi Minh Highway is the most fabled section of all.\n\nFrom Phong Nha, the road cuts through the canopy, offering 240 kilometers of twisting, narrow pavement. \n\nOnly a handful of settlements are scattered along the way, making this one of the most remote trips in the country.\n\nThe highway ends at historic Khe Sanh, the location of an infamous battle during the Vietnam War. \n\nA visit to the open-air museum, scattered with tanks, vehicles and aircraft from the war is an integral part of the journey.\n\nThis day's ride requires extra concentration and preparation.

Teeming with wildlife and lush mangroves, here the locals live in harmony with the mighty river.\n\nThe delta forms a labyrinth of narrow alleys that are best explored by boat. In the larger sections vendors sell fresh produce and fish from their vessels in charismatic floating markets.\n\nA loop back towards Saigon signs off the final chapter of this motorcycle journey. \n\nThe city is filled with a new batch of eager motorcyclists, also searching for their perfect ride. \n\nOver pho and iced coffee, stories are traded and keys exchanged.

They also point to the numerous allegations of sexual misconduct levied against Trump that they say should disqualify him from office.\n\nThe President-elect's previously stated position on preventing refugees from entering the United States has also raised the ire of protesters, who believe the country is morally obligated to resettle families escaping foreign wars and persecution.\n\nMany of the protesters have taken a note from Britain's playbook in response to Brexit by wearing safety pins as a symbol of solidarity with minorities. \n\nMost of all, protesters are annoyed that Donald Trump will assume the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Clinton, 47.3% to 47.8%, respectively.

The race had appeared close, but on Sunday Hofer conceded to left-wing independent Alexander Van der Bellen when early returns ran against him.\n\nThe far-right refugee-blocking candidate campaigned hard on the issue of migrants, calling for a complete end to immigration in a bid to preserve the country's \"ethnic culture.\" \n\nThe migrant crisis reached a tipping point for many in 2015 when almost a million refugees crossed into Europe from the Balkans. At least 700,000 of them traveled via Austria. \n\nAlthough the country has largely been a transit stop in the migrant journey, Austria received over 88,000 asylum applications last year. \n\nThe trendy young face of Austria's far-right\n\nFrance\n\nThe popularity of France's National Front has soared in the wake of terrorist attacks and an influx of refugees fleeing Middle East unrest. \n\nMarine Le Pen, leader since 2011, has tried to \"detoxify\" the party founded by her father Jean-Marie of its reputation for racism and xenophobia -- and has seen its share of the vote rise to 27% in last year's regional elections.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNN, Le Pen said that her party can cure France's economic malaise; since the 2008 economic crisis unemployment has risen from 7.1% to around 10%, while almost a quarter of the nation's youth is now out of work. \n\nEconomic growth in France, the eurozone's second-largest economy, has also slowed in recent months to just 0.2% of GDP.\n\nLe Pen is hoping that the recent rise in populist parties and politicians around Europe and the United States will continue in April and May 2017 when French voters go to the polls to elect a new president. \n\nThe National Front leader has utilized similar tactics to the US President-elect by tapping into frustrations of the French electorate and focusing on a more nationalistic agenda to sway voters to her corner. This week she vowed to oversee a return to France's glory days, saying if she were in power, the country would be \"nothing like you have seen in the last 30 years.\"\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande will not seek re-election \n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) enjoyed a surge of support at the 2015 general election under the leadership of Nigel Farage.\n\nFarage was one of the chief architects of the Brexit campaign for Britain to leave the European Union.\n\nUKIP's share of the vote was 12.6% behind the traditionally dominant Conservative and Labour parties.\n\nThe party finished second in 118 of the 650 parliamentary contests. However, it only gained one seat in the House of Commons because of the UK's first-past-the-post system.\n\nUKIP's personal record of 3,881,099 votes came at a time when immigration into the country was at its highest rate since the turn of the century. \n\nUKIP has become a major influence in the political scene, giving a voice to those frustrated with the perceived \"Westminster elite.\"\n\nBut recent infighting and Farage's flirtations with the US President-elect have distracted a party which must now regroup under new leader Paul Nuttall\n\nCan Europe survive the Trump effect? \n\nGermany\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel took a bold step by vowing to welcome one million refugees in 2015, and in 2016, she paid for it at the ballot box. \n\nFormed in 2013, the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany (AfD) was initially galvanized into action by what it saw as Merkel's bungled handling of the eurozone crisis -- specifically the multiple Greek bailouts. However, since then the party has assumed a more nationalistic platform strongly opposing the influx of migrants. \n\nAfD contributed to defeats for Merkel's Christian Democratic Union in Berlin and her home state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern during regional elections this year. Among the top issues for voters: rising rents, increasing gentrification and refugees.\n\nWith national elections due in the autumn of 2017, and following a poll suggesting that 82% of Germans were unhappy with her open door policy, Merkel admitted the country was not handling the influx as well as it should.\n\nOpinion: Europe follow Trump to the right\n\nNetherlands\n\nVoters in the Netherlands are set to elect a new parliament in March 2017, when the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant Party for Freedom (PVV) hopes to build on its strong showing in the past two elections. \n\nIts leader, the flamboyant Geert Wilders, made his name internationally in 2008 with the provocative online film \"Fitna,\" which juxtaposed the aftermath of terrorist attacks with verses from the Quran. \n\nThe Netherlands has a rapidly growing Muslim population -- an estimated 6% of the total in 2010. \n\nWilders has run on a party manifesto focused on a so-called \"de-Islamification\" of the Netherlands, in which he lays out an 11-point plan pledging, among other things, to shut down all the country's Islamic schools and close the borders to migrants from Islamic nations.\n\nExplore more on Europe's far-right movements ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.265721887350082, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1029, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.26013618686, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161204020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0126336248785197, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/09/politics/donald-trump-foreign-policy-sacred-cows/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1414, "scraper_regex": 1507}}, "headline": "Which foreign policy sacred cows will Donald Trump slaughter next?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1507, "date": "20161209120000", "story_content": "Donald Trump shook up America. Now it's the world's turn.\n\nThe President-elect's decision to flout 40 years of diplomatic convention and take a call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen last week suggested he may be just as disrespectful of protocol on the world stage as at home.\n\nThe call produced days of speculation about how the President-elect's impulsive style will reverberate around the globe and whether it could threaten the architecture of international relations.\n\nThere are many global traditions and arrangements that he could target, though each could carry a geopolitical or diplomatic price -- one reason even presidents who have come into office with all guns blazing often find that there's a reason why some taboos last so long.\n\nHere are some of the conventions Trump could shake up once he becomes president next month.\n\nTalking to North Korea's Kim Jong Un\n\nEven Obama, who was willing to engage historic US enemies like Iran and Cuba, has balked at speaking to North Korea's unpredictable leader, Kim Jong-un. The George W. Bush administration also snubbed Kim's equally volatile father and predecessor, the late Kim Jong Il. President Bill Clinton did mull a visit to North Korea late in his second term, but eventually decided not to go.\n\nThere have been direct contacts with Pyongyang through a channel at UN meetings between officials from the two sides in Beijing, and post-presidential missions to the Stalinist state by Clinton and Jimmy Carter.\n\nBut the idea of direct, presidential-level engagement with the leader of North Korea, who rules with an iron fist, has been taboo. One reason is that such talks would be seen as a reward for threats and behavior apparently designed to win concessions from Washington.\n\nBut with North Korea making swift advances in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and threatening to precipitate the first international crisis of the Trump administration, could that change?\n\nWhen asked by Reuters in May if he was ready to talk to Kim, Trump replied: \"I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him.\"\n\nAgain, it's easy to make such remarks on the campaign trail. A conversation would risk squandering presidential prestige unless it came with a high diplomatic deliverable, so Trump might balk. Still, given the President-elect's unpredictability and faith in his own skills as a deal-maker, it would be unwise to rule out contact with Kim just yet.\n\nMoving the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem\n\nTrump, like his predecessors Clinton and Bush, has voiced support for moving the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It's an easy vow for a candidate to make, especially since the issue is hugely important to the critical bloc of evangelical voters.\n\nBut it's one of those campaign vows that looks a lot less attractive viewed from the Oval Office.\n\nThe embassy is situated in Tel Aviv because the international community has not recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Furthermore, the Palestinians also claim Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, so moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would be extremely sensitive and seen by Arab states -- key to other US goals in the region -- as a sign that Washington is pre-judging final status peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThough Congress has passed legislation mandating the move, these complications prompted Presidents Clinton, Bush and Barack Obama every six months to employ the law's waiver provision to put off the move on national security grounds.\n\nBut it's not clear that Trump will take the same stance.\n\n\"We will move the American Embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem,\" Trump said at the annual meeting of the America Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington in March.\n\nStill, once he is embarked upon a presidency that will beset by global challenges, Trump may decide he doesn't want to ignite another crisis. So the White House will be under intense scrutiny once the next waiver is due, by June.\n\nHuman rights as a foreign policy priority\n\nFor successive administrations, the cause of human rights has been at the center of American foreign policy.\n\nThe issue does wax and wane in importance for different presidents. And there is often debate about whether a certain administration has de-emphasized human rights as a driver of relations with other countries. But human rights campaigners are especially worried about Trump.\n\nHe barely talked about the issue during his election campaign. And when he did, he provoked searching questions. In an interview with The New York Times in July, he declined to criticize Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for jailing thousands of political opponents and pointed out that the United States had its own share of problems.\n\n\"When the world looks at how bad the United States is, and then we go and talk about civil liberties, I don't think we're a very good messenger,\" Trump told the Times.\n\nTrump's admiration for the strongman leadership of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is accused of severely curtailing civil liberties, also worries critics -- as do his warnings during the campaign that he would target the families of terror suspects in airstrikes, an apparent infringement of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nThe President-elect's recent telephone call with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was also an eye-opener. According to a readout from the government in Manila, Trump invited Duterte to the White House and seemed to convey understanding of his bloody extra-judicial war on drugs.\n\n\"It was, a bit, very encouraging in the sense that I supposed that what he really wanted to say was that we would be the last to interfere in the affairs of your own country,\" Duterte said.\n\nThe Trump transition has not offered its own details of the call. But Duterte's interpretation begs the question of whether Trump will skip over human rights issues as he seeks better relations with leaders like Duterte and Putin, who have been ostracized by the Obama administration.\n\nCasting doubt on US alliances\n\nFor 70 years, US global power and the relative peace and security of the order that America built in the aftermath of World War II have been anchored on alliances. In Europe, NATO has often been referred to as the greatest defensive partnership in history and helped win the Cold War. In Asia, Washington's partnerships and security guarantees with Japan and South Korea kept the peace in a region now grappling with China's rise.\n\nBut if Trump makes good on some of his campaign rhetoric, those alliances could be in for radical reassessment.\n\nThe President-elect called on South Korea and Japan to pay the United States more for their protection by US troops.\n\nHe also appeared to cast doubt on the US-Japan security alliance.\n\n\"If somebody attacks Japan, we have to immediately go and start World War III, okay? If we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us. Somehow, that doesn't sound so fair,\" Trump said in South Carolina in January.\n\nSuch statements were one reason why Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hurried to New York last month to visit the President-elect.\n\nTrump's intentions towards NATO have also been questioned ever since he said Washington's willingness to defend its partners in the alliance would depend on whether they had met their financial and military obligations toward the organization.\n\nHe also said that NATO was \"obsolete\" and wasn't doing enough to fight terrorism.\n\nAmid alarm in Europe, there are signs Trump has been backtracking in calls with allied leaders.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday that he was \"absolutely certain\" the US would remain committed to the transatlantic alliance and security guarantees to Europe.\n\nBut the nervousness will persist until Trump visits Europe in person to deliver those sentiments publicly as president.\n\nDropping the careful talk about Islam\n\nThe two presidents in office since the September 11 attacks have been highly sensitive to any suggestions that the US war on terror was a war against Islam. Bush visited an Islamic cultural center in the days after 9/11 and Obama flew to Cairo in 2009 to offer \"a new beginning\" with the Muslim world. Just this week, Obama warned that stigmatizing \"good, patriotic Muslims\" feeds the narrative of terrorists.\n\nBut Trump is not known for careful language.\n\nA year ago, he called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" after a radicalized couple launched an attack in San Bernardino, California.\n\nThe President-elect has since watered down the Muslim ban but is still planning to bar refugees from Syria and in the campaign mulled surveillance of mosques and databases for Muslims in the United States.\n\nHe has not renewed such calls since winning the election, but he has also not laid out a clear alternative policy either. And his elevation to national security adviser of retired Gen. Michael Flynn, who has a history of emotive rhetoric critical of Islam, has alarmed Obama administration officials and even some Republicans.\n\nA more strident critique of Islam from the Oval Office would mark one of the most consequential breaks from the conventions followed by Trump's immediate predecessors.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.47769021987915, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1414, "FairnessVirtue": 6, "HarmVice": 11, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.25702992538, "HarmVirtue": 12, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 5, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 66, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209120000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.66760961810467, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 6.0}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/russia-congressional-hearing/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 725, "scraper_regex": 774}}, "headline": "GOP senator: Investigate Russia", "wordcount_as_scraped": 774, "date": "20161117000000", "story_content": "A leading Republican lawmaker is calling for investigations into alleged Russian cyberhacks during the US election despite President-elect Donald Trump's repeated calls for warmer ties with Moscow. \n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and one of the chamber's most experienced foreign policy hands, said the attempt by a foreign country to interfere with the US voting process needs better understanding and a vigorous response.\n\n\"Assuming for a moment that we do believe that the Russian government was controlling outside organizations that hacked into our election, they should be punished,\" Graham told reporters Tuesday. Referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Graham added that, \"Putin should be punished.\"\n\nGraham, who wants the hearings to examine all Russia's \"misadventures throughout the world,\" has the support of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. As other Republicans issued warnings about Russian activities, the hearings could become a source of tension between the GOP and the new President.\n\n\"You could see, going forward, a Congress that's really at loggerheads with the White House on policy toward Russia,\" said Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University.\n\nTrump's America\n\nGraham, who ran against Trump in the Republican primaries, admitted that \"clearly Donald and me have issues.\" But he added that he'll do \"everything I can to help him because he will be commander in chief in dangerous times.\" \n\nRussia, Graham said, is a \"bad actor.\"\n\nTo that end, Graham said hearings into Russia's activities should also address Moscow's annexation of Crimea and interference in Ukraine, its cyberattacks against US allies, and examine whether Russia is guilty of war crimes due to its intervention and bombing campaign in Syria.\n\nSplits on Russia\n\nThere have been splits on Russia in the past between Trump and fellow Republicans. GOP lawmakers have long called for the US to arm Ukrainian forces fighting Russian-backed rebels in the eastern part of the country. But the Trump campaign stripped that language from the Republican platform before the party's national convention in July, angering some lawmakers.\n\nThe intelligence assessment about Russian hacking during the election highlighted an even more dramatic split between Trump and many in his party. \n\nIn an October 7 statement, the US intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security announced they were \"confident that the Russian Government directed\" the theft of emails from US institutions including the Democratic National Committee and individuals, including Democratic campaign officials. \n\nThose emails were later leaked by groups such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and the online persona Guccifer 2.0. \n\nYet during the campaign, Trump said he didn't accept the intelligence community's assessment that Russia was behind the hack, suggesting instead that it \"could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\"\n\nSen. Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said early classified assessments he saw were inconclusive. \n\nDonald Trump's team of bitter rivals\n\n\"But do I personally think Russia's somewhere in the mix? Yes.\" Corker said he was \"all for more fully understanding what happened\" through hearings.\n\nVirginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the vice-presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket with Hillary Clinton, said the investigation would be well worth it. \n\n\"It's really important to know what a foreign government was trying to do to influence this election,\" Kaine said. \n\n'Stop it from happening again'\n\n\"Just the knowledge that it happened isn't the same as knowing everything about how it happened,\" Kaine said. \"Knowing how it happened can help everybody protect themselves, a lot of insight can come from that. It can stop it from happening again.\"\n\nIn Russia, there's a widespread sense that Trump's election will bolster ties with the US, leading to better trade and economic relations and perhaps the easing of sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\nTrump has repeatedly praised Putin as a strong leader and speaks of the need for better relations with Moscow. Putin was one of the earliest leaders to congratulate Trump on his victory, and has said he wants to improve relations with the US.\n\nSen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday \"we should put as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America's allies, and attempted to undermine America's elections.\"\n\nGraham urged Republicans not get sidetracked by the fact that the hacks may have helped their party. His fellow GOP lawmakers shouldn't \"let allegations against a foreign government interfering in our election process go unanswered because it may have been beneficial to our cause,\" he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.93050193786621, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 725, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.3914448069, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161117000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.89655172413793, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/sessions-marijuana-enforcement/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Could America's next top cop send marijuana legalization up in smoke?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 736, "date": "20161119020000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump's selection of Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general set the marijuana industry ablaze Friday. \n\nMore specifically, his nomination has left supporters of pot legalization troubled about what his confirmation could mean for the future of legalization efforts at the state level given that the drug remains illegal under federal law. \n\n\"(I)t couldn't be much worse for the marijuana law reform movement and our recent legalization victories,\" said Erik Altieri, Executive Director of NORML -- an advocacy group that supports legalization of the drug -- in a post on the group's website.\n\n'Good people don't smoke marijuana'\n\nSessions has not kept his strong feelings against marijuana use a secret. \n\n\"Good people don't smoke marijuana,\" Sessions said during a Senate hearing in April. \"We need grown ups in Washington to say marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized, it ought not to be minimized, that it is in fact a very real danger.\"\n\nIn 2014, Sessions also took aim at FBI Director James Comey for making a joke at a hearing about the FBI having to relax its marijuana rules if it wanted to attract more young people to join the bureau.\n\n\"Do you understand that that could be interpreted as one more example of leadership in America dismissing the seriousness of marijuana use?\" Sessions asked. \"And that could undermine our ability to convince young people not to go down a dangerous path?\"\n\nSeparately, a Justice Department staffer once claimed Sessions said in the 1980s he thought the Ku Klux Klan \"were OK until I found out they smoked pot.\"  \n\nSessions' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nFederal law is 'crystal clear'\n\nWhile roughly half of US states and the District of Columbia have decriminalized or legalized marijuana use, it remains illegal under federal law and, if confirmed, the Alabama senator will hold the power over the federal enforcement arm of criminal laws, such as the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nThe marijuana industry currently benefits from a legal memorandum issued by the Justice Department in 2013 that essentially adopted a policy of non-interference with marijuana-friendly state laws, so long as they don't threaten other federal priorities, such as preventing the distribution of the drug to minors and supporting cartels. But a Justice Department with Sessions at the helm has the ability to rip this up and simply issue a new memo -- reverting back to the old regime where states were left in a more precarious position.\n\nJohn Hudak, deputy director of the Center for Effective Public Management and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies marijuana policy, points out that Sessions could not only empower federal prosecutors across the country to begin targeting drug crimes again, but if the Justice Department sues individual states, it is unlikely to lose that battle in court.\n\n\"The law is crystal clear on this -- what states are doing is a federal crime,\" Hudak told CNN in an interview Friday.\n\nBrian Vicente, a Denver-based marijuana industry attorney, explained that the cloud of prosecution hangs over the heads of many proponents of the drug, especially those who use medical marijuana.\n\n\"Medical marijuana patients are scared,\" Vicente told CNN. \"They're scared they are going to be arrested by (federal agents) for following their doctor's orders.\"\n\nWill Trump save pot?\n\nThe question on many industry groups' minds Friday is whether Trump will serve as a check on Sessions' staunch opposition to marijuana use.\n\n\"President-elect Trump has said on multiple occasions that he respects states' right to establish their own marijuana policies. We would expect appointees who serve at the pleasure of the president to stick to the president's position on this subject,\" said Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project in a statement to CNN.\n\nOthers suggest he will see the majority of Americans support legalization efforts.\n\n\"If Trump is smart about this, he is going to look at the political landscape and say a lot of people support this,\" Hudak told CNN Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, others expressed hope that attacking marijuana use would simply take a back seat in Trump's administration given all of the other issues on his plate. \n\n\"I hope this administration maintains the status quo,\" said Hilary Bricken, an attorney in Seattle who represents marijuana businesses. \"But with a Republican majority-controlled Congress, if (Sessions) wants to say the war on drugs is back on, he won't face much opposition.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.265251994132996, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 720, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.66353485084, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161119020000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.30555555555556, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.edition.cnn.com/2017/01/16/politics/donald-trump-presidency/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1269, "scraper_regex": 1384}}, "headline": "Tumult surrounds Trump days ahead of his presidency", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1384, "date": "20170116220000", "story_content": "Donald Trump is four days away from assuming the presidency after one of the most tumultuous transitions in modern history, setting the stage for a rocky period of dramatic change, partisan acrimony and unpredictable results.\n\nTrump will take office with far lower poll ratings than his recent predecessors, with majorities of Americans doubtful of his capacity to handle the job. He's at war with the nation's intelligence agencies, has a dysfunctional relationship with the press, is fighting claims that he's too cozy with Russia and is brushing off conventional ethical standards for an incoming president. China has warned him about changing policy related to Taiwan and Mexico has threatened retaliation if Trump imposes a border tax.\n\nJohn Lewis became one of the most prominent Democrats to call the legitimacy of Trump's presidency into question, prompting a weekend retort from the President-elect, who tweeted that the civil rights icon is \"all talk\" and \"no action.\"\n\nFor any other incoming president, such a pile of controversies and crises would suggest an early political disaster is imminent for the new White House. But Trump broke the mold in his outsider campaign and has repeatedly shrugged off scandals and controversies that would have downed normal politicians. He appears determined to shake up conventions that have built up around the presidency for two centuries and has little time for those who say he lacks presidential demeanor.\n\nIn fact, many of the political storms raging as he takes office have been instigated by Trump himself. Inciting chaos and disruption has been the key to his political career, helping him rupture the Republican establishment and win the White House. He seemingly has no plans to change tactics in the White House.\n\n\"He is reinventing the modern presidency,\" said Timothy Naftali, a CNN presidential historian.\n\nBut as Trump takes office, his signature style, designed to keep everyone off balance, is facing its most significant test. Will his confrontational, brazen approach, the prosecution of personal grudges on social media and tendency to stir disorientation prove to be a workable template for a presidency? And will his method of deliberately picking at societal fault lines work when Trump is president of all Americans?\n\nMetrics for success\n\n\"Only time will tell whether he succeeds as a leader,\" said Naftali, who also teaches at New York University and warns that while Trump often plays by different rules, history will not. \"We know the metrics for success haven't changed -- public opinion, bills passed, confidence around the world, confidence at home, a strong economy. All these things are the same metrics.\"\n\nTrump, he continued, \"is reinventing the style of the presidency and every president has the right to do that. But he's going to be tested the same way.\"\n\nTrump will begin his administration in a deepening hole with public opinion.\n\nHis approval rating stood at 44% a week before the inauguration, according to Gallup. President Barack Obama was at 83% at the equivalent moment, George W. Bush was at 61% and Bill Clinton at 68%.\n\nA Pew Research poll found that 39% of Americans approve of the way Trump has outlined his policies while a Quinnipiac poll put his approval rating at 37% last week.\n\nGallup also found Trump under 50% on questions about whether he will handle military force wisely, how he would steer an international crisis and on his capacity to avoid major scandals in his administration. He does better over his ability to handle the economy and defend US interests abroad, but he still lags other previous incoming presidents at the equivalent time. \n\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, however, said Trump has a mandate even as Democrats point out he lost the popular vote and question the legitimacy of his victory.\n\n\"Donald Trump won a landslide election,\" Pence said Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"The American people spoke decisively, they wanted change and I promise ... come noon this coming Friday, change really begins and we are going to make America great again.\"\n\nStarting from such a low base of approval gives Trump little leeway should things begin to go wrong in his administration. Presidents who get into trouble in the polls generally become less effective in molding public opinion in times of crisis and in exerting leverage on Capitol Hill.\n\nIt's also notable that while Trump took care to keep his supporters on his side during his post-election \"thank you\" tour, he's done almost nothing to reach out to the millions of Americans who view his inauguration with anxiety.\n\nHe has instead spent his transition waging personal vendettas on Twitter, castigating CNN and other media organizations while putting more credibility in the statements of Russia and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange than those of US intelligence agencies.\n\nSenate probe into election hacking to review possible links between Russia, campaigns\n\nBut if Trump proves skillful at handling the presidency, it's possible his approval rating could quickly rise. And for Trump's supporters, who sent him to Washington to fundamentally dismantle the political class, blasting Meryl Streep on Twitter, slamming journalists, defying the intelligence establishment and ignoring conventions on avoiding conflicts of interests is not troubling at all.\n\nFuture problems?\n\nStill, the President-elect could be storing up future problems that could return and haunt him later in his administration.\n\nEthics lawyers have condemned his decision to flout the normal practice of presidents by not putting his assets in a blind trust as far short of what is necessary. Trump will hand over the running of his businesses to his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and has pledged not to discuss them. But he will retain his financial stake, which means he can still boost his own wealth indirectly by decisions he will make as President.\n\nThe President-elect will also take office beset by looming political challenges in Congress.\n\nTrump said at last week's news conference that Obamacare should be repealed and replaced nearly simultaneously, a sentiment that House Speaker Paul Ryan seemed to endorse at a CNN town hall. But no workable plan has emerged that could pass Congress and insure millions of people who will lose coverage if Obamacare is dismantled.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is calling for a \"stable transition period\" between the two moving parts of building a new GOP health care plan and several Republican senators are anxious about moving too quickly.\n\nTrump vs. his Cabinet\n\nDisagreements are also brewing at the heart of Trump's own cabinet. While most of his nominees appear to be heading for confirmation, clear differences emerged between the President-elect and his national security team at their hearings on Russia, torture, the Iran nuclear deal and the need to preserve US alliances.\n\nTheir positions raised questions about how their conventional views would fit with a president who seems intent on disrupting foreign policy traditions. Trump tweeted on Friday that there was no reason to worry.\n\n\"All of my Cabinet nominee are looking good and doing a great job. I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine!\"\n\nTraditionally, new presidents begin their administrations by using their inaugural address to call on the nation to unite after fractious political campaigns. Trump may do the same, though his scorched earth style leaves him with perhaps a bigger challenge in this area than any recent president. His handling of lingering questions about the extent of Russian interference in the election and the treatment of Hillary Clinton by the FBI could also be crucial to establishing credibility with those who oppose him.\n\nFor now, however, he remains hyper sensitive to the merest suggestion that his election victory was marred by outside influences, suggesting that corrosive questions about 2016 will linger long into his presidency\n\n\"What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the F.B.I. Based on the information they had she should never..... have been allowed to run \u2014 guilty as hell,\"  Trump said in consecutive tweets on Friday.\n\nFBI Director Comey's political firestorm, explained\n\nFormer Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said on CNN last week that such comments bode ill for Trump's presidency.\n\n\"I think those tweets are just the latest indication that Donald Trump is someone very insecure in his victory,\" he said last week. \"Every day, there are new developments and new shoes dropping, so to speak, that call into question the legitimacy of his win.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.88461542129517, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1269, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.42916167562, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170116220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.5216706067769903, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/04/us/california-oakland-fire/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [4074, 4150, 4486, 4571, 4671, 4798, 6349, 6510]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1169, "scraper_regex": 1084}}, "headline": "Warehouse fire: 33 bodies found; 70% of building still to be searched", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1084, "date": "20161204140000", "story_content": "At least 33 people have been confirmed dead, including teenagers and a deputy's son, in a massive blaze that gutted a converted warehouse over the weekend during an electronic dance party.\n\nThe death toll is expected to rise as crews search the wreckage of the two-story building, which burst into flames late Friday night.

So the key thing is, you've got to move slowly and you've got to preserve the scene at the same time so that the fire investigators can in fact determine the area of origin and subsequently the point of origin (of the fire), and then determine the cause.\" \n\nImpact Your World: How to help\n\n'You could feel the heat of the flames'\n\nFreelance journalist Sam Lefebvre said many people were just arriving at the warehouse when the fire started, because the dance party was supposed to go very late. The warehouse is a \"sort of live/work art space with a lot of old decorations and furniture,\" Lefebvre told CNN. An electronic music DJ known as Golden Donna was scheduled to perform. \n\nBy the time John Evanofski arrived at 31st Avenue, giant flames lit up the night sky amid the billows of black smoke.\n\n\"You could feel the heat of the flames,\" he said. \"Most of us were crying or unable to react. It was so hot and so terrible knowing that so many of us were still inside.\"\n\nConcerned family and friends used social media to find loved ones and offer support. \n\nA Facebook page created for the event became a forum for friends and family of the victims, who posted frantic messages seeking information about loved ones. Those who survived shared their names to show they were safe.\n\n'I had to let him go'\n\nFor filmmaker and photographer Bob Mul\u00e9, the warehouse was both his home and his community.  \n\nThe 27-year-old Mul\u00e9 said more than 20 people living in the warehouse paid rent and were all involved in the creation of the space.\n\nOn Friday night, Mule stopped upstairs to listen to some music he described as a \"very tame setting.\" Afterward, he headed downstairs to work on a painting. From his studio, he smelled smoke. \n\nAfter seeing the flames, Mul\u00e9 ran to find a fire extinguisher. He found one, but could not open the pin. When Mul\u00e9 turned back to save his camera and laptop, he spotted a fellow artist who called out for help. Mul\u00e9 suspected that heavy-set artist had broken his ankle after falling from the second floor. \n\n\"I was pulling him out,\" said Mul\u00e9, who suffered burns from the fire. \"The flames were too much. There was too much smoke and ... I had to let him go.\"\n\nThe Oakland 'Ghost Ship'\n\nThe building is known as the \"Ghost Ship.\"\n\nPhotos posted online show an interior cluttered with drums, keyboards, guitars, clocks, ornate beds, plush sofas, mirrored dressers, tables, benches and artifacts. Exotic lamps hang from the ceiling, and paintings adorn some of the walls.\n\nDarin Ranelletti, Oakland's interim director of planning and building, told reporters Saturday the city had only approved permits for the building to be used as a warehouse, not for residences. City officials also had not signed off on a special permit for the event, Ranelletti said. In addition, firefighters found no evidence of sprinklers in the warehouse.\n\nLast month the warehouse's owners had received notification of city code violations for hazardous trash and debris, property records show. Officials had not yet completed an investigation into a November complaint about an illegal interior building structure.\n\nCNN has reached out to the property owners for comment. \n\n31st- pic.twitter.com/8TX6jk0iYq\u2014 Oakland Firefighters (@OaklandFireLive) December 3, 2016\n\nCoping with a nightmare\n\nMore than 40 people gathered Saturday at the Chapel of the Chimes in Oakland for a vigil for victims.

The towering inferno of death and destruction shocked and saddened Iranians and exiles around the world.\n\nWatching the scene unfold on television last Thursday made my heart sink. For along with the tragic loss of life, a part of Iran's history was lost, and so was a part of my very own history.\n\nThe Plasco was built by my grandfather, Habib Elghanian, and his brothers to become, upon completion in 1962, Tehran's first high-rise on the capital's skyline. The brothers named the building after their pioneering plastics manufacturing company, PlascoKar.\n\nThe building was as famous as, say, the Chrysler and Empire State buildings but more analogous to New York's earliest skyscraper, the Woolworth Building.\n\nThe entrepreneurial brothers had built the commercial high-rise on land near Tehran's bazaar and fitted it with a one-of-a-kind shopping mall and commercial office space. Visitors would go to the rooftop of the 17-story building and enjoy 360-degree breathtaking view of Tehran.\n\nThe building -- which was completed even before the Shah's 1963 White Revolution that attempted to transform the economy and traditional social system -- was cherished as a symbol of Iran's modernization efforts. Its story, however, embodied the discord between those who wanted to modernize the nation and the clerics who opposed those efforts. The clerics were disdained by the participation of Iran's Jewish minority, which included my grandfather, in the country's economic progress. Shortly after Plasco was finished, a Shiite cleric named Mahmoud Taleghani protested over the idea that a Jewish family was the owner of Iran's tallest building.\n\nBut my grandfather, who grew up poor in Tehran's Jewish ghetto, remained very proud of the building, and continued to contribute to the economy by building an aluminum factory that made refrigerators and expanding his plastic factory, which made consumer products that had not been readily available in Iran.\n\nThe self-made entrepreneur loved Tehran and refused to budge when the 1979 Islamic revolution was brewing. When Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took over, my grandfather was imprisoned, put on trial for less than 20 minutes without a lawyer on trumped-up charges of espionage. A firing squad shot him at dawn. His execution, on May 9, 1979, sent shock waves through the Jewish community and most of the estimated 100,000 Jews left in Iran.\n\nAnd now almost 40 years later, it hurts to watch the loss of innocent lives in the destruction of this tangible part of my family's legacy. In fact, my grief over the disappearance of this artifact cannot compare to the immense pain of relatives mourning the loss of life in the fire. I received many messages of sympathy, from both inside and outside Iran, evoking my grandfather's memory.\n\nAccusations of negligence \n\nPeople were blaming the building's current owners, the Islamic Revolution Mostazafan Foundation (also known as the Foundation for the Oppressed), which is tied to the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guards, who control much of Iran's wealth.\n\nThough the Elghanian ownership of the building ended in the mid-1970s when Plasco was sold, the state-controlled foundation confiscated the landmark from the new owner during the 1979 revolution.\n\nInstead of preserving the edifice, the building's new owners allowed what had once been a bright, shining tower of Tehran's skyline to turn into a ramshackle space, dwarfed and supplanted by thousands of new skyscrapers. Space originally designed for offices had been carved up and converted into hundreds of garment workshops.\n\nFollowing last week's tragedy, Tehran municipal spokesman Shahram Gilabadi, speaking to the AFP news agency, said: \"More than 30 times we warned the building's owners that it was not safe, but unfortunately they did not pay attention\".\n\nFire brigade spokesman Jalal Malekias said: \"Even in the stairwells, a lot of clothing is stored and this is against safety standards. The managers didn't pay attention to the warnings.\" The head of the shirt maker's union, Mojtaba Droodian, told local Fars agency that the fire extinguishers were empty. \n\nSince the collapse of the building, a Twitter hashtag calling for the resignation of Tehran's mayor, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, over mismanagement was trending in Iran.\n\nThe head of the Mostazafan Foundation Saeedi Kia said the foundation had handed all the buillding's units over to the tenants and therefore didn't have control of anything apart from the overall ownership of the building. \"We wont shun our responsibility in this regard,\" he told local media.  He also says that they will rebuild the building according to global standards in two years' time.\n\nIf they were aware of the building's violations, why hadn't the owners or the city shut Plasco down until it was up to code? Clearly, the owners' indifference and the abusive sway of their power were at the root of this tragedy. They always loathed the landmark that was built by my family, but the least they could have done was to ensure the safety of the people inside.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.5377359390258802, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 761, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.4995867427, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.23390275952694, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/12/us/dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock-officers/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Standing Rock protest: The view from the other side of the fire hose", "wordcount_as_scraped": 666, "date": "20161212220000", "story_content": "They're the images history will remember: law enforcement using hoses on protesters advancing toward the Dakota Access Pipeline site last month.\n\nThe drone images from above, played on national television and shared on social media, conjure thoughts of the '60s, when water cannons were used on civil rights protesters.\n\n\"I agree, that is a bad optic out there,\" said Lt. Tom Iverson of the North Dakota Highway Patrol. \"But people are watching clips on Facebook; what's missing is the totality of the circumstances and what led up to that.\"\n\nIverson took CNN to the law enforcement side of the Backwater Bridge, the flashpoint for two major confrontations between police and protesters in what was otherwise nearly eight months of peaceful assembly at the Oceti Sakowin camp. That's where upward of 10,000 people from as far away as Hawaii ebbed and flowed into the makeshift camp about a mile from where the pipeline is being constructed on treaty land adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.\n\n\"Day in and day out agitators kept coming up to that line (at the bridge),\" Iverson said. \"What do protesters want us to do right there? Should we just let them run over us? Well, if that's what they want of us, that's not what you're going to get.\"\n\nIverson said on the night law enforcement used fire hoses -- he says calling them water cannons is inflammatory \u2014 hundreds of protesters had gathered near the bridge, and some were trying to get around the law enforcement line.  Police first tried using tear gas, he said.\n\n\"The wind was not conducive to that because the wind was blowing it right back at us,\" Iverson said. \"At that point the agitators started fires and a water truck was called up to the scene\" to put out the fires.\n\nIverson said the commanding officer made a decision that since other methods to contain the crowd were not working, the fire hose was the next viable option.\n\n\"I can guarantee you that there was not a single person there that got wet who did not want to get wet,\" he said. \"You put yourself in that situation of where you were right on the front lines intentionally knowing that water was there, because you were given plenty of heads-up warning.\"\n\nIverson said some protesters stood their ground in the freezing temperatures anyway because it made for a dramatic image in the national spotlight. \n\nBut members of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation have a different view, saying police amped up protesters with a militaristic approach.\n\n\"They showed up with military Humvees and armored personnel carriers, in full military garb,\" said Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network, an organization dedicated to protecting sacred land. \"They instigated a situation that did not need to be instigated.\"\n\nGoldtooth doesn't deny that \"we have to do our best to hold our folks accountable,\" but he said a tit-for-tat discussion over whom is to blame misses the point that the police approach furthered generations of hurt within the Native American community.\n\n\"It was so triggering for a lot of our people who carry a genetic memory of that same experience, but more dangerous and more lethal, going back a number of generations,\" Goldtooth said.\n\nStanding Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault is ready to move to the next phase of the conflict, battling Donald Trump's administration, which is largely expected to overturn the Army Corps of Engineers' decision to effectively reroute the pipeline.\n\nArchambault has told campers to go home until Trump takes office next year and the legal fight resumes (some have vowed to stay). In the meantime, Archambault wants history to remember most the mass of humanity that gathered at Oceti Sakowin on the tribe's behalf. \n\n\"This is the first time in our history that we have been joined by people of all races to support us against huge odds in the dead of winter,\" Archambault said. \"It means something because Native Americans feel like we are finally being heard.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.7302725315094, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 651, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.58505416129, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161212220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0721966205837203, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/29/middleeast/syria-ceasefire-russia-turkey-analysis/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1111, "scraper_regex": 1171}}, "headline": "How Russia and Turkey brokered peace in Syria -- and sidelined the US", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1171, "date": "20161230050000", "story_content": "Call it a pop-up alliance. After spending much of this year berating each other after Turkey shot down a Russian jet over the Syrian-Turkish border, the two governments are suddenly the \"honest brokers\" of a ceasefire in Syria -- one that is designed to lead to political negotiations. The United States, which has long championed the stuttering diplomatic process on resolving the Syrian conflict, is nowhere to be seen.\n\nThe ceasefire -- negotiated between Russia, Turkey and the Syrian government as well as Iran and Syrian rebel groups supported by Turkey -- explicitly excludes factions deemed by the United Nations Security Council as \"terrorists.\" This rules out the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the former al Qaeda affiliate in Syria that used to be known as Jabhat al-Nusra.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin declared that the ceasefire was only the first step, with other documents signed on enforcing the truce and beginning peace talks. The Syrian military promised to cease operations nationwide at midnight Thursday. \n\nHere's how the deal looks.\n\nRussia, Turkey in driving seat\n\nRussian and Turkey are now driving what had been a UN-led political process.\n\nEach is responsible for bringing its own allies into the process: the Russians will bring the Assad regime on board and the Turks as many moderate factions as they can coax or cajole. Both sides envisage a rapid timeline, with the Turkish Foreign Ministry saying the Assad regime and opposition would meet soon in Kazakhstan, according to Turkish state media.\n\nPlenty can still go wrong, and recent history gives little cause for optimism. \n\nPutin acknowledged that \"all the agreements reached are very fragile.\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavuso\u011flu said Thursday that details on how to monitor the ceasefire and apply sanctions against those who breached it were still being worked out. And he insisted there would be no direct negotiations between Turkey and the Syrian government.\n\nBut the intent is clear: peel off moderate rebel groups from the tacit alliances they have formed with radical Islamist groups in parts of Syria. Then crush the militant groups excluded from the process. And this is where, inevitably, things get complicated. \n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said influential Islamist groups such as Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam have signed up to the process. But the Syrian army has asserted that groups linked to Fateh al-Sham, of which Ahrar al-Sham has been the most prominent, will be excluded from the deal.\n\nOne source in Ahrar al-Sham, which receives extensive support from Turkey, acknowledged that it is involved in the negotiations. But late Thursday the group said on its Twitter feed that it \"has reservations about the proposed agreement\" and had not yet signed. Its ultimate decision will be important. If Ahrar does sign up, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham will be isolated and vulnerable. \n\nObama administration ignored\n\nThe timing of the deal is critical. The Russian-Turkish entente has exploited the political transition in Washington, ignoring the Obama administration in its dying days and betting that the Trump administration will accept a process already under way. \n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has already issued the invitation. \n\n\"I would like to express the hope that as soon as the administration of Donald Trump takes office, they will also be able to join these efforts,\" he said during a meeting with Putin in Moscow.\n\nSergey Aleksashenko at the Brookings Institution says \"Trump may believe that there isn't a clear alternative at this point, since the Syrian opposition has not been able to unify or put forward a single leader.\"\n\nThe President-elect has expressed doubts about the reliability of moderate groups previously supported by the Obama administration and suggested his administration would consider joining Russia in the battle against ISIS in Syria.\n\nWhy Turkey embraced Russia\n\nThe critical event in bringing about the new entente between Moscow and Ankara was the fall of Aleppo. The Assad regime -- along with its Russian and Iranian sponsors -- turned the tide of the civil war in seizing complete control of the largest city, or what remained of it. Rebel groups -- some of them supported by Turkey and the Gulf States -- retreated in disarray. Their evacuation was negotiated between Russia and Turkey. \n\nVladimir Putin held all the best cards, and it seems that Ankara decided to cash in its chips. It was not abandoning its allies among the Syrian factions, but refocusing its efforts on creating a \"Turkey-friendly\" region in northern Syria. In the process President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought to kill two birds with one stone. \n\nTurkey has long been exasperated by US support for the Syrian Kurdish militia known as the YPG. \"Up to now, the US has given weapons to the YPG, full stop,\" Cavuso\u011flu said Thursday. \n\nWashington sees the YPG as its battering ram against ISIS in northern Syria. Turkey sees it as a terror organization intimately linked to its own Kurdish insurgents, the PKK. A CNN team inside northern Syria earlier this year saw plenty of evidence of those links, including large posters of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in many Kurdish-dominated towns.\n\nThe United States has denied supplying the YPG with weapons but says it provides tactical support to the Syrian Democratic Forces, the umbrella group in which the YPG is the main component.\n\nOne sign of the new cooperation between Russia and Turkey is the introduction of Russian air power this week to help groups allied to Turkey rid the strategic town of Al Bab in northern Syria of ISIS fighters. Another is the establishment of a hotline to monitor breaches of the new ceasefire. \n\nAssad remains a hurdle\n\nThe Russia-Turkey axis may be a marriage of convenience, and there are some major hurdles to overcome. Turkey wants the Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah -- a key military supporter of the Assad regime -- out of Syria. That will not sit well with Iran, which is also sponsoring the ceasefire process. \n\nNor has Turkey abandoned its long-term goal that President Bashar al Assad must step down. That also remains the position of the Free Syrian Army, whose representative Abu Zeid said Thursday: \"The fact that the negotiations are based on Geneva 1 [the UN-sponsored peace process] means that there is no place for Assad in Syria's future.\"\n\nIn addition, some fighters with Islamist groups -- especially in Ahrar al-Sham -- may opt to join the resistance rather than lay down their arms. And the Gulf states -- especially Qatar and Saudi Arabia -- may decide to double down on their support for groups opposed to negotiations. \n\nAbu Zeid, who took part in the negotiations on behalf of the opposition, insisted Thursday: \"Our message to the Syrian population is that our fingers will remain on the trigger.\"\n\nBut the truth is that armed and political opposition to the Syrian regime, shorn of its support from Ankara, has rarely been weaker since the uprising against Bashar al-Assad began five years ago. And the most influential actors on the ground in Syria -- Russia, Turkey, Iran and the Syrian regime -- are, for now, all on the same page.

Yet the US could be trying it again", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1088, "date": "20161118150000", "story_content": "Donald Trump and his supporters have been all over the place about his plan for surveilling Muslims. The President-elect once advocated for a Muslim database. Then he walked it back. Then his spokesman said Trump never proposed such a thing. \n\nThen a source familiar with the incoming administration told CNN there will be a database and it'll be similar to the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS). \n\nNSEERS was a Bush-era program enacted shortly after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It disproportionately targeted Arabs and Muslims and was a point of contention between rights groups and the federal government for nearly a decade.\n\nIt was also a mega failure -- both strategically and, critics say, ethically.\n\nWhat is the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System?\n\nNSEERS, sometimes referred to as \"Special Registration,\" was a program for registering non-citizen visa holders -- such as students, workers and tourists -- that President George W. Bush's administration enacted on September 10, 2002. \n\nThe program had three parts. First, it required non-citizens to register when they entered the US -- a process that included fingerprinting, photo taking and interrogation. Second, it mandated that these people, as well as others already in the US, register and regularly check in with immigration officials. Third, it kept track of those leaving the country to make sure that temporary guests did not remain illegally.  Violators were arrested, fined and even deported.\n\nWho did NSEERS affect?\n\nMostly Arabs and Muslims.\n\nAll males 16 years of age or older from 25 countries were forced to register. Although no religious groups were explicitly targeted, all but one was a Muslim-majority country. The countries included: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Egypt, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen. The sole exception: North Korea.\n\nTrump promised during his campaign to start a program that will register and track people from certain high-risk countries, such as Iran, Syria and Afghanistan. His newly named White House aide, Kellyanne Conway, said the same thing that it will focus more on country of origin. \n\nWhat was the program's purpose?\n\nUS officials at the time believed the program was necessary to identify and capture terrorists who might enter the country on false pretenses or already be living among the population. \n\nThen-Attorney General John Ashcroft said the September 11 attacks exposed \"the vulnerabilities of our immigration system\" and made the case for NSEERS. \n\n\"In this new war, our enemy's platoons infiltrate our borders, quietly blending in with visiting tourists, students, and workers,\" Ashcroft said. \"They move unnoticed through our cities, neighborhoods, and public spaces. They wear no uniforms. Their camouflage is not forest green, but rather it is the color of common street clothing. Their tactics rely on evading recognition at the border and escaping detection within the United States. Their terrorist mission is to defeat America, destroy our values and kill innocent people.\"\n\nTrump has made similar arguments to ban and monitor Muslims, as well as oppose the US' resettlement of Syrian refugees.\n\nHow is NSEERS any different from what Trump is proposing?\n\nThe President-elect has floated and walked back a number of controversial policies regarding Muslims, including a \"temporary ban,\" a process of \"extreme vetting\" and even forcing all those living in the US to register with a national database. The flip-flops make it difficult to say for sure how his program would be different from NSEERS.\n\nHis campaign promises hinted at a more draconian system that targets a specific religion, bans an entire group and imposes registration on American citizens. However, his transition team says that's not the case.\n\nA source who spoke to CNN said the program Trump is considering would register and track foreign visitors from high-risk countries, including but not limited to Muslims. The source did not specify which countries would be impacted, but said it would be a \"moving target\" given the diffuse terrorist threat.\n\nWhen asked about a complete ban on Muslims, the source said \"it's something we're prepared for, but it's unlikely,\" before adding \"all options are on the table.\"\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller denied that Muslims would be the target of a new program.\n\n\"President-elect Trump has never advocated for any registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion, and to imply otherwise is completely false,\" Miller said. \"The national registry of foreign visitors from countries with high terrorism activity that was in place during the Bush and Obama administrations gave intelligence and law enforcement communities additional tools to keep our country safe, but the President-elect plans on releasing his own vetting policies after he is sworn in.\"\n\nAssuming Trump brings back NSEERS, what will be the likely impact?\n\nIt would be pretty devastating for the Arab and Muslim communities.\n\nThe previous program registered and monitored more than 80,000 men and boys, according to a 2012 report by Penn State Law and Rights Working Group, a coalition of local, state and national rights organizations. More than 13,000 of those registrants were placed in deportation proceedings, the report added.\n\nRights groups slammed NSEERS for targeting Arabs and Muslims, striking fear into those communities, confusing registrants with ambiguous and complex instructions that resulted in needless penalties, and even uprooting and tearing families apart.\n\n\"NSEERS targets only people from Arab and Muslim countries, along with North Korea, that is discrimination based on national origin. It is time to end the shame of NSEERS,\" Mary Rose Oakar, former president of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said in 2007.\n\nNSEERS faced a number of legal challenges from affected individuals and rights groups, who called for its repeal. However, none ever achieved much success.\n\nOkay, but it was pretty effective in stopping terrorists -- right?\n\nActually, no. It didn't result in a single terrorism conviction.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union told CNN this week that NSEERS \"actually made genuine efforts at trying to combat terrorism more difficult by destroying relationships with immigrant communities and actually negatively impacting the ability of the federal government to cooperate with foreign governments in fighting terrorism.\"\n\nThe program also ignored credible data from think tanks, including the New America Foundation, showing that most domestic terror attacks are carried out by US citizens.\n\nIn 2011, nearly a decade after its creation, President Barack Obama's administration suspended NSEERS by taking all 25 countries off its list. In December 2016, it finally ended it.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) attributed the program's suspension to its redundancies and inefficiencies, not pressure from rights groups -- though it did welcome the decision.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.53718996047974, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1061, "FairnessVirtue": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.49981216809, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 16, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 61, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161118150000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 5.545454545449999, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 5.7492931196984, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/europe/may-trump-analysis-foster/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Friendliness with Trump will give Theresa May a European headache", "wordcount_as_scraped": 710, "date": "20170126140000", "story_content": "Theresa May will be making history Friday as she becomes the first foreign leader to be welcomed at the White House by President Donald Trump.\n\nIt's Trump's first test on the world stage, and we will all be tuning in to see how he does, but for the British leader, the visit is much more than a photo opportunity.\n\nShe's likely to get the nod on a trade deal, which she needs to offset the cost of Britain leaving the European Union. It will also help her show opponents, both domestically and internationally, that she has a credible post-Brexit plan.\n\nThe White House meeting has been heralded in London as a diplomatic coup, and comparisons are already being made to the special relationship enjoyed by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. But they were natural bedfellows; getting too close to Trump carries a number of risks for May.\n\nFor a start, the UK isn't allowed to negotiate its own trade deals as long as it is still part of the EU, and there is a genuine fear in Brussels that Trump is out to destroy the bloc.\n\nHe hasn't made any secret of his support for Brexit and recently told The Times of London: \"I think people want ... their own identity, so if you ask me ... I believe others will leave.\" He is even expected to confirm a Brexiteer Ted Malloch as the next US ambassador to the EU.\n\nMalloch told the BBC last week: \"Mr. Trump has clearly said that any trade deals with anyone frankly in the future will be done on a bilateral basis.\"\n\nPressed on whether other EU countries could be offered a similar deal as the UK's, Malloch said: \"I think the idea of offering such a deal -- again negotiated on a bilateral basis -- to other European countries is an ingenious one, and it circumvents a certain bureaucratic organization called the European Union.\"\n\nWhile May does need a good relationship with Trump, she also needs a good relationship with the EU, given that she's about to start negotiating with it about the terms of Britain's exit from the bloc.\n\nA US trade deal that is meant to strengthen her position could ultimately have the opposite affect if she is seen to be siding with someone set to bring the whole system down.\n\nTrump's \"early embrace\" of the British will inevitably be seen as an attempt to divide Europe, according to Jonathan Eyal at the Royal United Services Institute, an independent defense and security think tank in London.\n\n \"The last thing that the UK needs is to be regarded as a battering ram for a US administration which wishes to promote the break-up of the EU,\" Eyal wrote this week.\n\nTrump started his first week in office with an attack on free trade agreements, pulling out of one in Asia and suggesting he will do the same in North America.\n\nIf he plans to finish it by taking aim at the EU during his meeting with May, it will put her in a very awkward position. Only last week, she said: \"We do not want to undermine the single market, and we do not want to undermine the European Union. We want the EU to be a success and we want its remaining member states to prosper.\"\n\nIf Europe weren't enough of an issue, there are a couple of other issues that the two leaders seem to disagree on. Earlier this week in Parliament, May was asked by a member of her own Conservative Party to make it clear to Trump that in no circumstances will she permit Britain to be dragged into facilitating torture. She clarified: \"We do not sanction torture and do not get involved in it.\"\n\nHours later, Trump, in an interview to ABC News, suggested he could be open to bringing back torture because he \"absolutely\" believes it works.\n\nMay's meeting with Trump is a landmark moment, but it's riddled with pitfalls for her and she knows it. Her plan is to \"renew the special relationship for a new age,\" and she insists she isn't afraid to talk \"frankly\" with the US leader. \n\nWe'll see how Trump copes with that as he shares the cameras for the first time with another world leader.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 682, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.2192602199299998, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.2258064516129, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/jeff-sessions-confirmation-what-weve-learned/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 779, "scraper_regex": 874}}, "headline": "What we've learned so far from Sessions hearing", "wordcount_as_scraped": 874, "date": "20170110220000", "story_content": "Sen. Jeff Sessions -- President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general -- denied \"damnably false charges\" of racism Tuesday as he kicked off his hours-long confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n\nSessions also said he'd play no role in considering prosecuting Hillary Clinton, opposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States and said he wouldn't challenge existing Supreme Court decisions on abortion and same-sex marriage. \n\nHere's some of what we've learned so far from Session's confirmation hearing:\n\nHe was ready to talk about race\n\nNowhere in Sessions' prepared remarks was a rebuttal of the accusations that sank his 1986 nomination for a federal judgeship. But he decided to address them \"head on\" anyway, denying decades-old claims that he had offered supportive words about the Ku Klux Klan and criticized the NAACP. He said those were \"damnably false charges.\" \n\n\"I abhor the Klan and its hateful ideology,\" Sessions said. \"I never declared the NAACP was un-American.\"\n\nThe Alabama senator and former US attorney told senators that in 1986, \"there was an effort to caricaturize me as something I wasn't.\" \n\nBooker to testify against Sessions \n\nAs he discussed those allegations of racism, his wife, Mary Sessions, became emotional in the crowd. \n\nSessions said he'd seen the horrors of racism \"as a Southerner.\" \n\n\"I know that was wrong, and I know we need to do better. We can never go back,\" he said. \"I am totally committed to maintaining the freedom and equality this country has to provide to every citizen and I can assure you that's how I will approach it.\"\n\nHe doesn't support a Muslim ban\n\nSessions backed away from Trump's campaign trail promise to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. \n\n\"I have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the United States,\" the Alabama senator said. \n\nHe did, though, open the door for religion to be used as a factor in approving visas. Under questioning from Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Sessions said some people hold religious views that are \"inimical\" to the safety of people in the United States. \n\nSessions also defended Trump, noting that he has backed away from his calls for an outright Muslim ban, instead aiming that ban at countries with terrorist activity.  \n\nHe won't help prosecute Clinton\n\n\"Lock her up\" chants rang through nearly every Trump campaign rally this fall. Trump once promised to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate his Democratic rival. \n\nIf any of that happens, though, Sessions says he'll have nothing to do with it. \n\nHe said he'd recuse himself, citing his role as a prominent Trump supporter during the 2016 presidential race. \n\n\"I believe the proper thing for me to do would be to recuse myself from questions involving those kinds of investigations involving Secretary Clinton that were raised during the campaign and could be otherwise connected to it,\" Sessions said, upon questioning by Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. \"I believe that would be best for the country because we can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute.\" \n\nHow he views abortion and same-sex marriage\n\nSessions said he would respect the 1973 Supreme Court decision allowing abortion and the more recent Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage -- even if he doesn't agree with the decisions.\n\n\"I believe it violated the Constitution,\" Sessions said in response to a question from Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein about whether he stands by his past statements calling Roe a \"colossal\" mistake.\n\n\"It is the law of the land, it has been settled for some time. ... I will respect it and follow it,\" Sessions said.\n\nLikewise, Sessions said same-sex marriage is settled.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has ruled on that, the dissents dissented vigorously, but it was 5-4 and ... I will follow that decision,\" he said.\n\nHe addressed the 'Access Hollywood' moment\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, wasn't willing to let Sessions dodge one of the biggest controversies Trump faced during the election: the \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. \n\n\"Is grabbing a woman by her genitals without her consent sexual assault?\" Leahy asked. \n\nSessions responded, \"Clearly it would be.\"\n\nHe thinks waterboarding is 'improper and illegal'\n\nSessions was pressed on waterboarding -- which Trump has spoken in favor of bringing back even though the practice is considered torture under US and international law and is illegal.\n\nPressed by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, on whether waterboarding is torture, Sessions replied that Congress has, since waterboarding's use in the early Bush administration during the war on terror, outlawed it.\n\n\"Congress has taken an action now that makes it absolutely improper and illegal to use waterboarding or any other form of torture in the United States by our military and by all our other departments and agencies,\" he said. \n\nHe wouldn't commit to a special prosecutor\n\nSessions was also grilled by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, on the Constitution's \"emoluments\" clause, which bans foreign business dealings by officers of the United States -- but might not actually apply to presidents. \n\nThe Alabama senator sidestepped the question, avoiding Blumenthal's urging to appoint a special counsel if Trump or a member of his family ran afoul of the law and saying he'd have to look into it.

More than 30 families came out for a quiet, two-hour shopping experience. \n\nThe store was open to the public as usual at 8 a.m. but wasn't crowded, and the overhead music was turned off, company spokeswoman Candace Disler said. \n\nMusic can be an agitating trigger to people with autism. \"They're processing it differently, and it could maybe even sound like nails scratching on a chalkboard to them,\" Erickson said. \n\nSensory stations with activities like kinetic sand and weighted blankets helped the children get grounded, according to Erickson. \"Different sensory things help them get acclimated to the store and grounds their body so they can really stay focused and can almost ignore anything else around them that would bother them,\" she said.\n\nA boy and his bed\n\nThe shopping trip landed 10-year-old Adam Moser a new bed.\n\nAdam functions at a preschool or kindergarten level, according to his mom, Linda, and communicates through an iPad app that speaks for him based on images he recognizes. \n\nHis struggles with verbal communication, making it difficult for Adam to tell his family what he likes and how he's feeling. But when he was able to roam the quiet store, he silently locked his gaze on a bed shaped like a big red Jeep.\n\n\"It was the look on his face and the fact that he went and sat down on it and then laid down on it\" made it a winner, Linda Moser said.\n\nMoser went back by herself Monday to buy the bed. \"With the phones ringing and waiting in the crowded customer service line, we would not have been able to stand there for the 15 minutes to order the bed,\" she said.\n\nShe has to guess about most things she buys for Adam, as she's unable to take him to try them out. She often uses resources like the Toys \"R\" Us \"Toy Guide for Differently Abled Kids.\"\n\nOn Saturday, store workers also transformed one section into a toy demo and play area where families could try some items from the guide.\n\nThe chain has worked with the National Lekotek Center for more than 20 years to produce the toy guide, Disler said. The nonprofit, which specializes in helping children and increasing community inclusion through play, evaluates and recommends toys in the guide that are developmentally appropriate for children with disabilities.\n\n'A smile versus a stare'\n\nFor parents like Moser, who has three boys, two of whom are on the autism spectrum, family outings can be just as stressful for adults as they are for children.\n\n\"Having them out in the community, bolting and going in a back room they're not supposed to be in, or they're having a tantrum because they want a fifth copy of 'Goodnight Moon,' \" Moser said, describing some of the difficulties. \"They're not children that need discipline. It's literally, we're trying, and giving into them every time doesn't do them any good. You know, there's a reason for it.\n\n\"When you have those parents who mutter under their breath and stare, you know, it hurts. A smile versus a stare makes such a difference.\"\n\nThat possibility of a tantrum and the judgment and stress can be discouraging to families. Experiences in public, however, can be vital to the development of children with autism.\n\n\"If we're avoiding those situations, we're not able to teach them how to navigate them,\" said Candice Col\u00f3n-Kwedor, senior clinical director at the May Institute School for Autism and Developmental Disabilities. \n\nThis is why Erickson, who has 26-year-old daughter with autism, aimed to facilitate the shopping event, held during store hours but in a controlled setting. \"These are opportunities to grow, and we understand they can't shut down the entire world for our folks.\n\n\"We want them to go in just like any other customer, and they were able to handle it and enjoy it, and I think that's what we saw,\" Erickson said.\n\nJust in case, the employee break room was transformed into a quiet room for families whose children became agitated and needed to rest.\n\nTeachable moments\n\nThe Toys \"R\" Us \"sensory-friendly shopping\" initiative, which started in the UK three years ago, is being rolled out in the United States, Disler said.\n\nAfter encouragement from advocates like Erickson, the chain launched a US pilot program, hosting about eight shopping events at stores across the country since June.\n\nThe holiday event was geared toward adults and children who came with the Autism Society, but for traditional shoppers, literature about the disorder was also available. \"It served as a teachable moment,\" Erickson said. \n\nAdvocacy groups across the country are approaching retailers to collaborate in the effort to bring an inclusive shopping experience.\n\nStore leaders at Target in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, partnering with Wellspan Health Philhaven, planned a similar shopping event to help that community. However, the chain does not have plans to expand the events company-wide, spokeswoman Angie Thompson said.\n\nBass Pro Shop in Foxborough, Massachusetts, has partnered with the Boston-based May Institute for a \"Sensitive Santa\" event for the past two years. Families are able to meet Santa in the store before it opens to the public.\n\nAnd because surprises can be unnerving, the May Institute also aims to cut down on those, providing parents with a storyboard illustrating each step of the event, spokeswoman Julie Burgess said. \n\nAbout 1% of the world's population has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMoser hopes more businesses will continue to develop initiatives for the growing community of families who cope with these challenges. \"There's a lot of us, and getting us out in the community is really great for the kids, but we can't always do that,\" she said.\n\n\"It changes the family dynamic 24/7, turns everything upside down,\" Erickson said.\n\n\"When you have something like this, it makes it easier on everyone, and that can mean so much to a family.\"\n\nErickson is planning to co-host another Toys \"R\" Us shopping event in the spring, \"because it really is helpful all year-round.\"\n\n\"It helps with awareness, because sometimes these children are kept home and not out in the community, and people will have a greater understanding if they're out in the community. You know, now we talk about autism awareness, but we're not there yet,\" Col\u00f3n-Kwedor said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 28, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.8116883039474491, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1122, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 7.90961335787, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 28, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.2085561497326203, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/17/politics/barack-obama-last-acts-donald-trump/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Obama pushes through controversial moves before Trump takes over", "wordcount_as_scraped": 685, "date": "20170118010000", "story_content": "A flurry of actions from the President Barack Obama's White House, first noted by CNN in late December, seem designed specifically to help enshrine his legacy and potentially foil some policy priorities of his successor. And the outgoing Democrats have not slowed down as they get ready to hand over the keys of the White House to Donald Trump and Republicans on Friday at noon. \n\nHere are some more of Obama's most recent actions, how they fit into his legacy, and how they might be viewed by the President-elect. \n\nHigh-profile pardons and commutations \n\nObama issued his splashiest grants of clemency on Tuesday when he reduced the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, who provided sensitive information to Wikileaks, and pardoned Gen. James Cartwright, who was convicted of lying to investigators during a leak probe. In both cases, Obama faced resistance from Republicans, who have accused Manning of being a traitor. \n\nBut he's not finished just yet. Already an avid user of his presidential clemency powers, Obama is expected to hand down additional grants on Thursday to non-violent drug offenders, who sentences he's been commuting at a rapid pace as he prepares to depart office.\n\n \n\nWet foot, dry foot \n\nLast week, Obama announced he was ending a decades-long immigration policy that allowed Cuban migrants to gain legal residency if they made it safely onto US soil. The policy had been derided as preferential, but advocates said it was still necessary to help those fleeing political persecution on the island. \n\nProminent Cuban-American lawmakers, including Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, blasted the move. But administration officials said it was a natural extension of Obama's reopening of ties to Cuba, the future of which remains uncertain in a Trump administration.\n\n \n\nAppointments and nominations\n\nJust as he has for the past eight years, Obama is churning out the thousands of nominations and appointments required to keep the federal government running. Most of his latest don't require Senate confirmation, including naming a slate of top aides and allies to various boards and panels. But a few, including a new ambassador to Congo, would need a vote to proceed -- all but impossible in the few remaining days of his administration. \n\n\"Even if they are not confirmed for the position that they've been nominated for, there may be future opportunities in a similar area where they could continue to serve the United States,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday.\n\nGuantanamo transfers\n\nTen former Guantanamo Bay detainees arrived in Oman this week, the latest attempt by Obama's administration to empty the naval facility. One of Obama's first acts in office was ordering the facility closed. \n\nEarnest conceded Tuesday the goal would remain elusive. But he suggested the transfers wouldn't stop. \n\n\"At this time, I don't anticipate that we will succeed in that goal of closing the prison, but it's not for a lack of trying, I assure you,\" Earnest said. \"The possibility of additional transfers remains a possibility.\"\n\n \n\nEducation decision\n\nAs his term wraps up, Obama is considering a final policy shift forcing hundreds of school districts to cut spending at well-financed elementary and secondary schools and move nearly $1 billion dollars to schools with large numbers of low-income students. The policy, written by the Education Department, is under review by the White House budget office and has drawn fierce opposition from Republican lawmakers and school administrators. \n\nIt was first proposed in September, but the department appears to have rushed to adopt it since Trump won the presidential election. Adopting the regulation before Friday at noon would bind the incoming Trump administration unless Congress overturns it. \n\nNew monuments \n\nMaking last-minute use of his conservation powers, Obama designated a set of landmarks in the American South as national monuments last week. \n\nThe sites all mark the civil rights movement: A Birmingham hotel where Martin Luther King Jr. strategized, an Alabama monument to the Freedom Riders, and a South Carolina site that tells the story of reconstruction. Obama has used his unilateral powers under the Antiquities Act to preserve land and marine areas from around the Pacific island of Midway to undersea mountain ranges in the Atlantic.\n\n ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.98019802570343, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 1, "wordcount": 657, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.8982375470700001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0441400304413997, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/12/africa/ghana-wave-energy/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 824, "scraper_regex": 871}}, "headline": "Could waves become the next big renewable energy source?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 871, "date": "20161212130000", "story_content": "The force of crashing waves can generate huge amounts of energy.\n\nBut there's a catch: how do you develop technology that can withstand the sea's harsh environment with minimum disruption to the ecosystem?\n\nOne Israeli-based company, Yam Pro Energy -- believes it can offer the ideal solution and is set to build a wave-energy plant on the coastline of Accra, Ghana's capital city.\n\nWave technology is an endeavor that has recently been trying to catch up with the likes of solar and wind energy. \n\nIt exploits a resource -- the oceans -- that covers 71 per cent of our planet, it's environmentally friendly, mostly cost-free once set up and it could be revolutionary to coastal countries.\n\n\"There's so many wave power companies and as many different devices, so finding one that actually works best is trial and error,\" said Mark Jacobson, who is a Stanford University professor and director at The Solutions Project, a company which aims to help the world move to 100% renewable energy.\n\nHowever, Yam Pro Energy says its innovative technology is the \"best choice in renewable energy systems.\"\n\nThe machinery will utilize the crashing waves to harvest hydraulic pressure and turn it into electricity.\n\n\"It was easy,\" laughed Yam Pro Energy's CEO, Zeev Peretz. \"We negotiated (with Ghana) for many years, but in the end we succeeded.\"\n\n\"The demand (for energy) is very big and I think it will help people (improve) their life.\"\n\n\"Floaters\" will be connected to wave breakers on the coastline and will bob up and down as waves crash in.\n\nPeretz said their technology was much more efficient than other renewable energy sources because it can generate 65% of energy per year, compared to solar panels and wind turbines which generate between 22-24%.\n\n\"The rest is heat and just waste,\" Peretz said.\n\nThe advantages of wave power, the company argues, is that their machines do not emit pollution, waves are more predictable than other renewable sources and despite the original set up being costly, the running and maintenance costs are low.\n\n\"If the waves are too high we are given forecasts days ahead which helps to analyze the situation,\" Peretz said.\n\nWhile construction in Accra won't begin until well into 2017, Yam Pro Energy has already secured the coastline to build its power station. It has also teamed up with local partners, secured its power purchase agreement (PPA) from the local electrical company and has been given space on the grid so it can sell the energy produced.\n\nPeretz said 10,000 households will benefit from the project.\n\nNo impact on wildlife?\n\nAccording to Emanuele Taibi, an island energy analyst from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the biggest challenge with wave power is proving it can withstand the sea's harsh environments.\n\n\"There are quite a lot of prototypes and they're doing quite well, but (for an investor), the main point is over 20 years -- how will the machine perform?\"\n\nPeretz said Yam Pro Energy had taken this into consideration and that it will conduct maintenance frequently.\n\nCompared to other devices -- like buoys -- which can become destroyed and sink in rough seas, Yam Pro Energy's patent is more efficient, it says.\n\n\"We don't have to send scuba divers or boats out. All the maintenance is from the land, so we just put floaters up and you (can) do whatever you need to do (then) put them back down.\"\n\nThe company prides itself on providing renewable energy that's clean and affordable in an environmentally responsible way. But Greenpeace's UK Chief Scientist and Policy Director, Doug Parr told CNN that while it supported wave power, checks needed to be in place to ensure the technology doesn't impact wildlife.\n\n\"No source of power has zero impact on the environment,\" he said, adding that assessments need to be made to \"judge whether the clean energy benefits are justified.\"\n\nFuture predictions  \n\nJacobson, from The Solutions Project, supported the development of wave technology in Ghana, but said that its growth won't be as rapid as solar and wind. \"While there's a reasonable resource of wave power to exploit, if you're comparing it to other technologies it's just not going to be penetrating as much,\" he said.\n\nInstead, it will compliment other renewable energy technologies. \"It's definitely worthwhile doing ... We should invest (in it) as much as we can.\"\n\nThe Solutions Project predicts that if Ghana can transition to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2050, wave energy will account for 1.4 per cent of it.\n\nAnd while that may seem small, Jacobson insisted it wasn't. \"The amount of energy worldwide is enormous. So something that is large is actually small in comparison to the power demand worldwide.\"\n\nHe said there was \"no downside\" in transitioning into a world which only uses renewable energy.\n\n\"These countries can become more energy independent. There's less risk of conflict, less terrorism because there's fewer centralized plants and you solve the climate problem simultaneously.\"\n\nIRENA's Taibi was more optimistic. He said that while the growth of wave power has been gradual, it was only \"a matter of time\" before it became the \"sixth pillar\" of renewable energy that will become commercialized.\n\n\"The good news is there's quite a lot of innovation coming from different approaches to the same resource.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.9977827072143559, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 824, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.29844153246, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cnn.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 3, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161212130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.18446601941748, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/28/arts/roger-ballen-theatre-apparitions/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [2832, 2838]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1235, "scraper_regex": 1342}}, "headline": "Life after death captured in photos by Roger Ballen", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1342, "date": "20161228100000", "story_content": "His work may appear two-toned at first glance, but photographer Roger Ballen weaves deep layers of color into his complex art. \n\nBallen was born in New York and first introduced to a camera at age thirteen by his mother, an editor with Magnum photography agency. He moved to South Africa in 1982 after falling in love with the country while working as a geologist. \n\nPursuing his scientific career, Ballen took photos as \"a hobby\" wherever he went, always using black and white film and thinking deeply about his art. \n\n\"It's not something I did just in my spare moments,\" Ballen tells CNN. \"I thought about photography and have been thinking about photography every day of my life since I've been about 18 years old.\"\n\nBallen's first published photographs were documentary in style, and examined the forgotten lives and villages of South Africa's poor communities. \n\nHis portraiture series of marginalized white South Africans -- taken over a period of twenty years -- were eventually published in a book called Platteland. The book brought him global attention, but made life for him difficult. \n\n\"I spent 30 years of hardly selling the work to anybody, and doing it out of gut and passion, and there were certain years in South Africa where I was ostracized,\" says Ballen. \"I always say that in the 1990s in South Africa my only friend was my dog.\"\n\nPhotographic art\n\nSouth Africa's apartheid government may not have appreciated Ballen's photography, but his distinct, daring work eventually became so popular that he quit his job as a geologist and became a full time photographer. \n\nAlthough still deeply confrontational, he began taking more of an artistic license with his work. \n\nWhile his subjects have changed over distinct photographic periods -- from villages, birds, humans and other animals -- his focus on the mind, and the way it can trap people, is a running theme throughout his work. \n\n\"I see myself as a psychological photographer,\" Ballen says. \"There is no way out of the mind.\" \n\nHis latest work, \"The Theatre of Apparitions,\" is yet another step deeper, exploring people's subconscious and their view of the afterlife through a series of photographs of drawings made on glass. \n\nBallen reflects upon the deeper meaning of his new, otherworldly works and his career below.\n\nCNN: Why did you choose black and white photography over color? \n\nBallen: I started in black and white from the early days and I like black and white because it's very reduced, it's very abstract, it doesn't pretend to be capturing so-called reality. It's a pure art form. And you can't separate my photographs from the fact that they're in black and white. The meaning is synonymous. \n\nCNN: Which photographers have had the greatest influence on your work? \n\nBallen: People like Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz, who was a Hungarian photographer who moved to the United States. He gave me some understanding on what photography as an art could be. \n\nAnd then there were people like Henri Cartier-Bresson, who told me something about the moment. I believe it's still the most important thing to understand in photography, that you're actually freezing a moment that can't be repeated. There were also photographers like Elliott Erwitt, who taught me about humor in photography.\"\n\nCNN: What do you believe is the major difference between between photography as an art form and documentary photography?\n\nBallen: I think a work of art, first of all, deals with more philosophical, existential universal issues. You know, what is the nature of human condition? What is the nature of order versus chaos? What is the relationship of human to animal? \n\nRead: Japanese artist plays with guts and gore\n\nSo-called documentary or snapshot photography is dealing with a particular moment in a particular historical time and doesn't go beyond that period. If you don't understand the history when you look at it, then it doesn't really say very much. \n\nCNN: Your works have been described as dark, strange and mysterious, among many other adjectives. How do you describe them?\n\nBallen: Dark or disturbing wouldn't be words that I would use. Because when people say that, they are saying that the pictures are penetrating something in themselves that makes them nervous, so they call them dark. \n\nBut if the pictures are inviting and bring forth a certain emotion to the viewer and they call them dark, I guess they should probably call them light because they are giving them something that they haven't been aware of or don't want to be aware of. So dark might be light.\n\nI would say the words mysterious, dream-like, enigmatic, metaphoric might be good ways to categorize my work and I would hope my pictures are all of those or some of those. \n\nBut the best way to describe them is Ballenesque, it just deals with my aesthetic, my state of mind. And I don't see anything is necessarily dark or light or anything. Everything is just what it is and it's just a reflection of who I am, which ultimately is quite mysterious.\"\n\nCNN: How has your work changed and developed over your long career? \n\nBallen: I've changed in a lot of ways but I'm still the same, so if you look at the work over the years, there are elements in a lot of those photographs that carry a certain message, carry a certain aesthetic. On the other hand, the works have become much more complex and the aesthetic has become much more unique, and so the work has gotten to the point where people can say well that's a Roger Ballen photograph.\n\nCNN: You're very disciplined in the way your approach your work. Where does that come from? \n\nBallen: My father was super disciplined. He was a lawyer in New York City and he was a workaholic and so I think I took after him and my mother was very artistic, so I have these two sides to me.\n\n\"Sometimes I compare myself to the old superman movies that I used to watch as a ten-year-old in New York on television. He used to be Clark Kent working for the newspaper in the office and at some point he just goes out, changes into Superman. Well that's sort of what I can do, I can just shift from something very business, scientific, logical into the world that I work in within seconds, without even thinking about it.\"\n\nCNN: Your book \"The Theatre of Apparitions\" has just been published, what do the pictures in the book represent?\n\n\"This is a very different project because I didn't use physical reality, they are all drawings that I made on glass and then photographed. So they are photographs but they're not taken in three-dimensional space. I don't think I would've been able to make these without all my experience in photography. But they still are drawings and through them I was able to get to a different place in my mind.\n\nThey deal with the issue which is the most important issue that people deal with subconsciously, and that is what happens after you die.  So in all cultures, there's ghosts or ancestors, so these are photographs of spirits. Photographs that are pondering what do you look like, what does it look like in the afterlife? \n\nCNN: Did your art help you come to terms with the afterlife?\n\n\"You know, you don't get there. You can't get there, it's impossible. But I think you get to the point where I've gotten to. When I was younger I had all the answers. Then, for a couple of decades I had all the questions -- and I don't have any answers to any questions anymore.\n\n\"You get to a point where your mind just shuts off and it is what it is. I think if you pretend you have answers to these things then maybe you're on the wrong track. But it doesn't mean you shouldn't work towards something. That's a crucial point.\"\n\n\"The Theatre of Apparitions,\" by Roger Ballen, is published by Thames and Hudson and available now.
