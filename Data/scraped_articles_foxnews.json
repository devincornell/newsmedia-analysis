{"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/30/cdc-considers-lowering-threshold-level-for-lead-exposure.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [67]}}, "headline": "CDC considers lowering threshold level for lead exposure", "wordcount_as_scraped": 911, "date": "20161230160000", "story_content": "NEW YORK \u2013 \u00a0The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering lowering its threshold for elevated childhood blood lead levels by 30 percent, a shift that could help health practitioners identify more children afflicted by the heavy metal.\n\nSince 2012, the CDC, which sets public health standards for exposure to lead, has used a blood lead threshold of 5 micrograms per deciliter for children under age 6. While no level of lead exposure is safe for children, those who test at or above that level warrant a public health response, the agency says.\n\nBased on new data from a national health survey, the CDC may lower its reference level to 3.5 micrograms per deciliter in the coming months, according to six people briefed by the agency. The measure will come up for discussion at a CDC meeting January 17 in Atlanta.\n\nBut the step, which has been under consideration for months, could prove controversial. One concern: Lowering the threshold could drain sparse resources from the public health response to children who need the most help - those with far higher lead levels.\n\nThe CDC did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExposure to lead - typically in peeling old paint, tainted water or contaminated soil - can cause cognitive impairment and other irreversible health impacts.\n\nThe CDC adjusts its threshold periodically as nationwide average levels drop. The threshold value is meant to identify children whose blood lead levels put them among the 2.5 percent of those with the heaviest exposure.\n\n\"Lead has no biological function in the body, and so the less there is of it in the body the better,\" Bernard M Y Cheung, a University of Hong Kong professor who studies lead data, told Reuters. \"The revision in the blood lead reference level is to push local governments to tighten the regulations on lead in the environment.\"\n\nThe federal agency is talking with state health officials, laboratory operators, medical device makers and public housing authorities about how and when to implement a new threshold.\n\nSince lead was banned in paint and phased out of gasoline nearly 40 years ago, average childhood blood lead levels have fallen more than 90 percent. The average is now around 1 microgram per deciliter.\n\nYet progress has been uneven, and lead poisoning remains an urgent problem in many U.S. communities.\n\nA Reuters investigation published this month found nearly 3,000 areas with recently recorded lead poisoning rates of at least 10 percent, or double those in Flint, Michigan, during that city's water crisis. More than 1,100 of these communities had a rate of elevated blood tests at least four times higher than in Flint.\n\nIn the worst-affected urban areas, up to 50 percent of children tested in recent years had elevated lead levels.\n\nThe CDC has estimated that as many as 500,000 U.S. children have lead levels at or above the current threshold. The agency encourages \"case management\" for these children, which is often carried out by state or local health departments and can involve educating families about lead safety, ordering more blood tests, home inspections or remediation.\n\nAny change in the threshold level carries financial implications. The CDC budget for assisting states with lead safety programs this year was just $17 million, and many state or local health departments are understaffed to treat children who test high.\n\nAnother concern: Many lead testing devices or labs currently have trouble identifying blood lead levels in the 3 micrograms per deciliter range. Test results can have margins of error.\n\n\"You could get false positives and false negatives,\" said Rad Cunningham, an epidemiologist with the Washington State Department of Health. \"It's just not very sensitive in that range.\"\n\nThe CDC doesn't hold regulatory power, leaving states to make their own decisions on how to proceed. Many have yet to adapt their lead poisoning prevention programs to the last reference change, implemented four years ago, when the level dropped from 10 to 5 micrograms per deciliter. Other states, including Virginia and Maine, made changes this year.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is close to adopting a rule requiring an environmental inspection - and lead cleanup if hazards are found - in any public housing units where a young child tests at or above the CDC threshold.\n\nIf the CDC urges public health action under a new threshold, HUD said it will follow through. \"The only thing that will affect our policy is the CDC recommendation for environmental intervention,\" said Dr. Warren Friedman, with HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes.\n\nTo set the reference value, the CDC relies upon data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey. The latest data suggests that a small child with a blood lead level of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter has higher exposure than 97.5 percent of others in the age group, 1 to 5 years.\n\nBut in lead-poisoning hotspots, a far greater portion of children have higher lead levels. Wisconsin data, for instance, shows that around 10 percent of children tested in Milwaukee's most poisoned census tracts had levels double the current CDC standard.\n\nSome worry a lower threshold could produce the opposite effect sought, by diverting money and attention away from children with the worst exposure.\n\n\"A lower reference level may actually do harm by masking reality - that significant levels of lead exposure are still a problem throughout the country,\" said Amy Winslow, chief executive of Magellan Diagnostics, whose blood lead testing machines are used in thousands of U.S. clinics.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.65111351013184, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 869, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.37410270131, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161230160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.53164556962025, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/03/latest-official-says-partygoers-got-out-or-were-trapped.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [78]}}, "headline": "The Latest: Official says partygoers got out or were trapped", "wordcount_as_scraped": 958, "date": "20161203210000", "story_content": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2013 \u00a0The Latest on a deadly fire in a converted warehouse in Oakland, California (all times local):\n\n12:25 p.m.\n\nAuthorities say arson investigators and other fire experts will comb through the wreckage of a deadly fire in Oakland, California, but the burn site is not considered a crime scene.\n\nAlameda County Sheriff's Sgt.

But dozens of cities across the country, as well as colleges and churches, have openly defied the law. The Obama administration did not press the issue, but Trump has vowed to cut off federal funding to so-called \"sanctuary\" cities.\n\nUniversity of California will continue to admit illegal immigrants under the same criteria as U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Under Napolitano's official new policy, campus police are not allowed to cooperate with local, state or federal law enforcement agencies to \"investigate, detain, or arrest individuals for violation of federal immigration law.\"\n\n\u00a0U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement considers schools \u2013including universities and colleges - \"sensitive locations,\" where they will not act unless \"exigent circumstances exist.\" A law enforcement official told FoxNews.com that ICE does not conduct enforcement on campuses unless there is a serious and \"extraordinary\" circumstance involved, such as a threat to national security.\n\n\"The ICE and [Customs and Border Patrol] sensitive locations policies, which remain in effect, provide that enforcement actions at sensitive locations should generally be avoided, and require prior approval from an appropriate supervisory official, \" Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Gillian Christensen told FoxNews.com. \"DHS is committed to ensuring that people seeking to participate in activities or utilize services provided at any sensitive location are free to do so without fear or hesitation.\"\n\nBut those are regulations and policies subject to change under a new administration, and most observers expect Trump to take a hard line on illegal immigration. Napolitano's move appears to be a pre-emptive strike, according to Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at Center for Immigration Studies.\n\n\"She is doing this for political effect,\" Vaughan said. \"The University is trying to look like they are standing up against what a Trump Administration might do, but I think this is very problematic because if they go so far as to obstruct law enforcement, they are violating federal law and could be putting people at risk.\"\n\nThe University of California already has established facilities called Centers for Undocumented Students at their Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, and Los Angeles campuses. The policies are in keeping with those of a state with the most pro-illegal immigrant policies in the nation.\n\nAccording to California law, minors who are in California without immigration documentation may be educated in public grade schools, and if they meet the same academic requirements that all U.S. citizens do, they can attend public universities and pay in-state tuition.\n\nIn May 2016, President Napolitano announced that the university would earmark $.8.4 million a year through the 2018-2019academic year for \"undocumented student support\" across its 10 campuses.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 9, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.73333334922791, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 641, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.82589434181, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 13, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 52, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 8.11232449297972, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/05/owner-oakland-warehouse-rebuked-over-post-about-deadly-fire.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 556, "scraper_regex": 590}}, "headline": "Owner of Oakland warehouse rebuked over post about deadly fire", "wordcount_as_scraped": 590, "date": "20161205100000", "story_content": "The man who owned the converted Oakland warehouse known as the \"Ghost Ship,\" which caught fire over the weekend killing 36 people, drew scrutiny over a Facebook post in which he lamented over what he had lost.\n\nDerick Ion's Facebook-post received more than 2,000 mostly-critical comments before it was deleted, according to KTVU-TV.\n\n\"Confirmed.

The United States was trying to hide its active 'behind the scenes' roll by preparing to abstain rather than voting for the resolution. But in the context of the Security Council where only an American veto can prevent anti-Israel resolutions from automatically passing, an abstention is a vote for the resolution. And because of this automatic majority, an anti-Israel resolution like this one cannot be reversed by a future American president. A veto once cast cannot be cast retroactively.\n\nThe effect, therefore of the Obama decision to push for, and abstain from, a vote on this resolution is to deliberately tie the hands of President Obama's successors, most particularly President elect Trump. That is why Trump did the right thing in reaction to Obama's provocation. Had the lame duck president not tried to tie the incoming president's hands, Trump would not have intervened at this time. But if he had not urged the Egyptians to withdraw the resolution, he would have made it far more difficult for himself to try to bring about a negotiated resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe reason for this is that a Security Council resolution declaring the 1967 border to be sacrosanct and any building behind those boarders to be illegal would make it impossible for Palestinian leaders to accept less in a negotiation. Moreover, the passage of such a resolution would disincentivize the Palestinians from accepting Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu's invitation to sit down and negotiate with no preconditions. Any such negotiations would require painful sacrifices on both sides if a resolution were to be reached. And a Security Council resolution siding with the Palestinians would give the Palestinians the false hope that they could get a state through the United Nations without having to make painful sacrifices.\n\nPresident Obama's lame duck attempt to tie the hands of his successor is both counterproductive to peace and undemocratic in nature. The lame duck period of an outgoing president is a time when our system of checks and balances is effectively suspended.\u00a0 The outgoing president does not have to listen to Congress or the people. He can selfishly try to burnish his personal legacy at the expense of our national and international interests. He can try to even personal scores and act on pique. That is what seems to be happening here. Congress does not support this resolution; the American people do not support this resolution; no Israeli leader \u2013 from the left, to the center, to the right \u2013 supports this resolution. Even some members of Obama's own administration do not support this resolution. But Obama is determined \u2013 after 8 years of frustration and failure in bringing together the Israelis and Palestinians \u2013 to leave his mark on the mid-East peace process.\u00a0 But if he manages to push this resolution through, his mark may well be the end of any realistic prospect for a negotiated peace.\n\nOne would think that Obama would have learned from his past mistakes in the mid-East. He has alienated the Saudis, the Egyptians, the Jordanians, the Emirates and other allies by his actions and inactions with regard to Iran, Syria, Egypt and Iraq.\u00a0 Everything he has touched has turned to sand.\n\nNow, in his waning days, he wants to make trouble for his successor. He should be stopped in the name of peace, democracy and basic decency.\n\nBut it now appears that Obama will not be stopped. Four temporary Security Council members have decided to push the resolution to a vote now. It is difficult to believe that they would have done so without the implicit support of the United States. Stay tuned.\n\nAddendum\n\nAs predicted, the United States allowed the anti-Israel resolution to be approved by the United Nations Security Council. Votes in favor were cast by Russia, which has occupied Kornengsberg since 1945, after capturing that ancient German city, ethnically cleansing its population and bringing in hundreds of thousands of Russian settlers; China, which has occupied Tibet and brought in thousands of Chinese settlers; France who occupied and settled Algeria for many years; Great Britain which has occupied and colonized a significant portion of the globe; and assorted other countries, several of which have horrendous human rights records.\n\nIsrael on the other hand, offered to end the occupation and settlements in 2000-2001 and again in 2008 only to be rebuffed by the Palestinian leadership. But Israel is the only country to have been condemned by the Security Council for an occupation and settlement. This hypocrisy is typical of the United Nations as even our representative acknowledged when she explained why the United States abstained.\n\nNow peace will be more difficult to achieve, as the Palestinians become further convinced that they do not have to accept Netanyahu's offer to negotiate without preconditions.\u00a0\n\nThank you, President Obama for completing your 8 years of failed foreign policy with a final blow against, peace, stability and decency.\u00a0\n\nCongress can ameliorate the impact of this destructive resolution by enacting a statute declaring that the resolution does not represent the United States' policy, which is that peace will not come through the United Nations but only by direct negations between the parties.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., slated to speak. It is sponsored by the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization, and aimed at bringing religious communities together under common beliefs.\n\n\"My hope is that we can provide a place for members of the community, who are so fearful and concerned about our values being challenged, to speak up,\" Interfaith Organization Board Member Nahma Nadich told FoxNews.com. \"We need to affirm our values and be in solidarity with each other to protect all members of our community against hateful, divisive rhetoric.\"\n\nBut the location of the event has raised concerns, as the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center operates two mosques --one in Boston, where the event will be held, and one in Cambridge where several convicted terrorists reportedly worshipped. They include Boston Marathon bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev; Aafia Siddiqui, who plotted a chemical attack on New York City and Tarek Mehanna, who was sentenced in 2012 to 17 years in prison for conspiring to aid Al Qaeda.\n\nIn addition, a founder of ISBCC, Abduraham Alamoudi, was sentenced in 2004 to 23 years in prison for taking part in a plot to kill Saudi royal officials, has allegedly worshipped at the mosque.\n\nNeither the mosque nor top officials have been implicated in criminal activity. But critics say several speakers at the mosque have delivered fiery and hateful sermons, and that its connections to terror make it an unlikely host of an event calling for peace.\n\n\"It's ironic that they would hold a rally against hate in one of the most hateful houses of worship in New England where imam after imam has been found to preach anti-Semitism, homophobia, and hate for the United States, its people and its government,\" Director of Research at Americans for Peace and Tolerance Ilya Feoktistov told FoxNews.com.\n\nU.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz has dismissed Americans for Peace and Tolerance's claims as \"incredibly racist and unfair.\"\n\nBut Feoktistov referred to a 2010 video of Abdullah Faaruuq, a guest preacher, exhorting worshipers to \"grab onto the rope, grab onto the typewriter, grab onto the shovel, grab onto the gun and the sword.\" Faaruuq told FoxNews.com last year that ISIS was not created by Islamic teachings, but rather by America.\n\n\"It was created by the United States' encouragement into other people's countries seeking weapons of mass destruction that don't exist,\" Faaruuq said. \"Destroying their societies and leaving the bitter taste in young people's mouths.\"\n\nIn August, ISBCC appointed an associate imam, Abdul-Malik Merchant, who, according to APT shared anti-Semitic posts on social media. Merchant issued an apology to the Jewish community.\n\nLocal Jewish leaders said neither the ISBCC nor the mosques it operates should be judged by the actions of a few.\n\n\"I have been working with representatives of the ISBCC for over a decade, both as a congressional rabbi, as a leader in the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization, and as an officer of the Massachusetts Board of Rabbis, and in all of those capacities, I have found both lay and clergy leadership of the ISBCC to be partners in working for greater understanding and tolerance,\" Rabbi Toba Spitzer of West Newton, Mass., told Fox News in an email. \"The relationship is one of mutual respect and dialogue; to insinuate anything else is both false and dangerous.\"\n\nA member of the planning team for the event, Rabbi Or Rose of Hebrew College in Newton, Mass., said the ISBCC plays a key role in \"inter-religious bridge-building\" efforts in Greater Boston.\n\n\"ISBCC has graciously opened its doors to host a much-needed gathering dedicated to fostering an ethos of pluralism and standing firmly against prejudice and hate,\" Rose told FoxNews.com in an email.\n\nFeoktistov said faith leaders and elected officials are turning a blind eye to what has taken place in the mosque.\n\n\"I think lawmakers discount the hatred for political reasons because the hatred is being spouted by what they consider to be a valuable minority,\" Feoktistov told Fox News. \"They are holding this event at an extremely hateful place, and that doesn't bother them at all.\"\n\nNeither Warren nor Walsh responded to requests for comment. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said his department welcomes religious groups working together to promote a positive message.\n\n\"The Boston Police Department is committed to building relationships with the members and leaders of all the religious communities in Boston, including those at ISBCC,\" Evans told FoxNews.com. \"It is now more than ever that we need to have connections and foster trust and communication between the police and the people we serve.\"\n\nThe \"Interfaith call for Dignity & Diligence\" event will take place at ISBCC in Roxbury, on Sunday, Dec. 11 at 6 p.m.\n\nISBCC Executive Director Yusuf Vali said in a statement that the work at the ISBCC embodies a community that \"builds bridges\" and \"brings people together.\"\n\n\"That's precisely the work we will be doing on Sunday night when Bostonians of diverse faiths gather with elected officials, community leaders, and our neighbors to stand together and renew our commitment for the common good and standing up against all forms of hate and bigotry,\" Vali said. \"As Americans who are Muslim, and as members of the faith community that includes Christians, Jews, and other faiths, we stand together united against extremism, bigotry, hate, and all forms of violence.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 36, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.919020652771, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 915, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 10.011563562100001, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 36, "mft_sum": 59, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161209210000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 6.44808743169399, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 5.36363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/29/trump-holds-q-discussing-jobs-russia-israel.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [67]}}, "headline": "Trump holds Q&A, discussing jobs, Russia, Israel", "wordcount_as_scraped": 707, "date": "20161229130000", "story_content": "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2013 \u00a0President-elect Donald Trump applauded the return of 8,000 jobs to the U.S. and hailed his transition discussions with President Barack Obama in a series of comments that amounted to the most detailed interaction he's had with journalists since before the election.\n\nIn one of his cameos Wednesday on the front steps of his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump touted plans by a Japanese mogul to bring jobs to the United States. They could be the first of the 50,000 jobs that tech billionaire Masayoshi Son promised to create after meeting with the president-elect earlier in December.\n\nIn the grand scheme of the economy, the jobs announcement is unlikely to have a major impact. Still, it's another example of how Trump is trying to stoke voters' belief that he is actively fighting for their well-being.\n\nSon is the founder and chief executive of SoftBank, one of Japan's largest technology outfits. He owns the U.S. mobile carrier Sprint, which Trump said Wednesday would be moving 5,000 jobs \"back\" to the United States. Son also controls OneWeb, which Trump said would hire 3,000 workers.\n\nIt was unclear whether the president-elect was referencing the Dec. 6 commitment by Son to invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs.\n\nTrump said the addition of 8,000 jobs was \"because of what's happening and the spirit and the hope.\"\n\nStill, the U.S. job market has been robust for much of 2016. Employers have added more than 2.2 million jobs over the past 12 months -- a sign of economic health that predates Trump's presidential victory.\n\nSprint has struggled since its 2013 acquisition by SoftBank. The carrier shed roughly 9,000 workers between 2012 and 2016, reducing its staff to 30,000, according to annual reports.\n\nSprint Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said in a statement that the company is \"excited\" to work with Trump.\n\n\"We believe it is critical for business and government to partner together to create more job opportunities in the U.S. and ensure prosperity for all Americans,\" Claure said.\n\nThe Sprint jobs announcement came after tensions rose and fell Wednesday between Trump and Obama. Trump has made it clear that it didn't sit well with him when Obama recently boasted that he would have won the election if he'd been running.\n\nTrump appeared again later Wednesday night on the Mar-a-Lago steps, this time alongside legendary boxing entrepreneur Don King, who appeared to be one of several guests attending a dinner party. King carried about a dozen flags, including those of the U.S. and Israel; wore two big diamond necklaces, one with a pendant with the Star of David and another with the American flag; and sported a large pin featuring a picture of Trump.\n\nWith King by his side, Trump dismissed days of tense remarks by the outgoing and incoming presidents about who would win if they were to hypothetically run against each other, saying he and Obama had \"a very, very good talk.\"\n\n\"We talked about it and smiled about it and nobody is ever going to know because we are never going to be going against each other,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier, he had accused Obama of throwing up \"inflammatory\" roadblocks during the transition of power and said his administration was treating Israel with \"total disdain.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Eric Schultz said Obama phoned Trump. \"Today's call, like the others since the election, was positive and focused on continuing a smooth and effective transition,\" Schultz said. \"The president and president-elect committed to staying in touch over the next several weeks.\"\n\nTrump also took issue with the Obama administration's decision not to block a United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israeli settlements.\n\nHe told reporters that Israel is being treated \"very, very unfairly,\" maintaining that countries that are \"horrible places\" never get reprimanded. He refused to directly answer a question about whether Israel should stop building settlements, saying he is \"very, very strong on Israel.\"\n\nHe dodged a direct response when asked about accusations that Russia hacked the U.S. election, saying computers have \"complicated lives very greatly.\"\n\n\"We don't have the kind of security we need,\" Trump said, adding, \"Nobody knows what's going on.\" He said he believes \"we have to get on with our lives.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.31406044960022, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 684, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.24896670488, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 13, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229130000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.9005847953216397, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.1818181818200002}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/28/trump-putin-discuss-mutually-beneficial-trade-security.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [71]}}, "headline": "Trump, Putin discuss 'mutually beneficial' trade, security", "wordcount_as_scraped": 875, "date": "20170129030000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0President Donald Trump had an hourlong discussion Saturday with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 the first since Trump assumed office last week \u2014 raising questions over the fate of U.S. sanctions against Moscow and whether the two will look to enhance military cooperation against the Islamic State group.\n\nThe White House provided a thin readout on the call between the two leaders, saying it was \"a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair.\"\n\nThe two leaders discussed \"a range in topics from mutual cooperation in defeating ISIS to efforts in working together to achieve more peace throughout the world including Syria,\" the White House statement said, using an acronym for the militant group.\n\nContrary to the statement from the White House, the Kremlin emphasized that the two leaders addressed the importance of \"restoring mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between business circles of the two countries,\" hinting that the two men discussed the sanctions, implemented by the Obama administration as a consequence of Russia's actions in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin also said that Putin and Trump spoke in particular about international issues, including the fight against terrorism, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Iran's nuclear program, the situation on the Korean peninsula and the Ukraine crisis.\n\nMoscow has applauded Trump's promises to rebuild U.S.-Russian relations, which have been pushed to their worst level since the Cold War by the Ukraine crisis, war in Syria and allegations of Russian meddling in U.S. elections. Trump signed a presidential memorandum on the plan to defeat the Islamic State group Saturday, including in it the possibility of teaming up with \"new coalition partners,\" suggesting that pairing up with Russia on counterterrorism issues isn't off the table.\n\nTrump was noncommittal about whether he was considering lifting the economic sanctions ahead of the call, telling reporters Friday: \"We'll see what happens. As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether sanctions were discussed on the call.\n\nIn 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region and backed separatists fighting government forces in eastern Ukraine, drawing widespread condemnation in Europe and the United States.\n\nIn response, sanctions were implemented against sectors of Russia's economy, including financial services, energy, mining and defense. The Obama administration also sanctioned people in Putin's inner circle.\n\nShortly before leaving office, President Barack Obama also ordered sanctions on Russian spy agencies, closed two Russian compounds in the United States and expelled 35 diplomats that he said were really spies. These sanctions followed an assessment by U.S. intelligence that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump become president.\n\nTrump's tempered approach to U.S.-Russia relations has already raised concern among several European allies who believe keeping Russia in check is essential to regional security.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, whose country \u2014 as part of the European Union \u2014 also has punished Russia for its provocations in Ukraine, voiced the view of many in Europe, telling reporters in Washington on Friday: \"We believe the sanctions should continue.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence and other senior advisers joined Trump for the call with Putin, including his national security adviser, retired Gen. Michael Flynn, chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior strategist Steve Bannon. Trump also spoke on Saturday with the leaders of Japan, Germany, France and Australia.\n\nTwo Republican senators \u2014 Arizona's John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Ohio's Rob Portman, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 warned the White House about easing any punishments on Moscow and they pledged to turn the sanctions into law.\n\n\"I hope President Trump will put an end to this speculation and reject such a reckless course,\" McCain said in a statement. \"If he does not, I will work with my colleagues to codify sanctions against Russia into law.\"\n\nPortman said lifting the sanctions \"for any reason other than a change in the behavior that led to those sanctions in the first place would send a dangerous message to a world already questioning the value of American leadership and the credibility of our commitments after eight years of Obama administration policies.\"\n\nMcCain has emerged as a frequent critic of Trump among Capitol Hill Republicans. He takes a dim view of trying to reset relations with Moscow and says Trump should remember that Putin is \"a murderer and a thug who seeks to undermine American national security interests at every turn.\"\n\n\"For our commander in chief to think otherwise would be naive and dangerous,\" McCain said.\n\nMcCain and Portman are part of a bipartisan group of senators who have introduced legislation designed to go beyond the punishments against Russia already levied by Obama and to demonstrate to Trump that forcefully responding to Moscow's meddling isn't a partisan issue.\n\nThe bill would impose mandatory visa bans and freeze the financial assets of anyone who carries out cyberattacks against public or private computer systems and democratic institutions.\n\nThe legislation also mandates sanctions in Russia's all-important energy sector and on investments in the development of civil nuclear projects to rebuke Moscow for its provocations in eastern Ukraine and military support for Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Howard Amos in Moscow contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.12273216247559, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 865, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.230936828440001, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170129030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.93063583815029, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/11/iran-seals-16-6b-boeing-deal-to-buy-80-planes.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [61]}}, "headline": "Iran seals $16.6B Boeing deal to buy 80 planes", "wordcount_as_scraped": 572, "date": "20161211210000", "story_content": "TEHRAN, Iran \u2013 \u00a0Iran's flag carrier finalized a major deal with U.S. plane maker Boeing Co. to buy $16.6 billion worth of passenger planes Sunday in one of the most tangible benefits yet for the Islamic Republic from last year's landmark nuclear agreement.\n\nIran Air's deal for 80 jetliners is the biggest agreement Iran has struck with an American company since the 1979 revolution and U.S. Embassy takeover. It has the potential to transform Iran's creaking and accident-prone aviation industry, which has been hobbled by years of sanctions.\n\nThose curbs have prevented the country from buying new planes from Chicago-based Boeing and European rival Airbus, and in many cases made it difficult for Iranian airlines to secure much-needed spare parts.\n\nThe deal covers 50 single-aisle 737 Max 8s, a soon-to-be-introduced version of Boeing's existing narrow-body 737 line.\n\nIt also includes 30 777s, a wide-body, twin-engine plane typically used on long-haul routes that is popular with other Persian Gulf carriers such as Dubai-based Emirates. Half of the order will cover the 777-300ER version, while the rest will be of the 777-9 model still under development.\n\nIran's state-run IRNA news agency said the planes would be delivered over the next decade. The first will start to arrive in 2018, Boeing said.\n\nIn September, Washington granted permission to Boeing and Toulouse, France-based Airbus to sell billions of dollars' worth of aircraft to Iran. Airbus needed U.S. approval because at least 10 percent of its planes' components are of American origin.\n\nThe U.S. and other world powers agreed last year to lift crippling sanctions on Iran in exchange for it curbing its nuclear activities. The U.S. still maintains extensive sanctions on Iran for activities unrelated to its nuclear program.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and several Republican lawmakers have criticized the nuclear deal, but it's unclear whether they would scrap the agreement, which was reached with Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.\n\nIranian Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi, who attended the signing ceremony, said it was a \"historic\" day for Iranian aviation and that the deal would create 8,000 jobs for Iranians.\n\n\"The deal has a clear message for the world: we support peace and security as well as the growth of Iran based on a win-win policy,\" he was quoted as saying. \"We hope that despite changes in the U.S. administration, the country will remain loyal to its commitments.\n\nThe Republican-led House of Representatives last month voted to bar commercial aircraft sales to Iran in a move that could block the Boeing deal. That legislation must still pass the Senate, where it will likely face opposition from Democrats. U.S. President Barack Obama has said he will veto the bill if it reaches his desk before he leaves office on Jan. 20.\n\nBoeing made a point of saying it worked closely with the U.S. government throughout the deal-making process and will continue to \"follow all license requirements.\" The Iran Air deal \"will support tens of thousands of U.S. jobs\" linked to the 777s alone, it said.\n\nThe plane maker said the deal value was based on list prices, though in practice customers typically negotiate discounts for bulk orders.\n\nMost of Iran's aging fleet of 250 commercial planes was purchased before 1979, and as of June only 162 were operational, with the rest grounded because of a lack of spare parts. Iran Air, whose website lists a fleet of 43 planes, offers direct flights to over 30 international destinations, including London.\n\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.9448819160461429, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 555, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.82272160507, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161211210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.7027027027027, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/08/trump-son-in-law-kushner-moves-to-distance-self-from-business-ties.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1588, 3774, 3776]}}, "headline": "Trump son-in-law Kushner moves to distance self from business ties", "wordcount_as_scraped": 931, "date": "20170108160000", "story_content": "Jared Kushner, President-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law and one of his closest advisers, is taking steps to distance himself from his sprawling New York real estate business in what is the clearest sign yet he is planning to take a position in the new administration.\n\nKushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, must clear a series of hurdles before he takes any post in Washington. \n\nHe will need to argue that a federal anti-nepotism law that bar officials from appointing relatives to government positions does not apply to him as well as eliminate potential conflicts of interest between his family's multi-billion dollar real estate empire and his government duties.\n\nKushner, who often has the last word with the president-elect before a major decision is made, has explored stepping away from his role as CEO of the real estate business and has consulted with federal officials about resolving potential conflicts, according to his lawyer.\n\n\"Mr. Kushner is committed to complying with federal ethics laws and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take,\" said Jamie Gorelick, a partner at the law firm of WilmerHale, in a statement. \"Although plans are not finalized, Mr. Kushner would resign from his position at Kushner Companies and divest substantial assets in accordance with federal guidelines.\"\n\nGorelick said that Kushner \"would recuse from particular matters that would have a direct and predictable effect on his remaining financial interests. \u00a0He would also abide by federal rules requiring impartiality in particular matters involving specific parties.\"\n\nKushner's challenges highlight a notable pattern of the incoming administration. While some government officials will be forced to divest and rearrange their financial portfolios to comply with federal ethics laws, their boss will not be required to do the same.\n\n As president, Trump is exempt from laws aimed at ensuring federal employees' personal financial interests do not influence their decisions. The president-elect has said he intends to distance himself from his own international real estate business, but he has suggested he intends to break from precedent by retaining a stake in the company.\n\nTrump is expected to announce some plans for his business during a Wednesday news conference.\n\nThe Kushner Companies is a major real estate investor in New York and elsewhere and participated in roughly $7 billion in acquisitions in the last decade. If Kushner joined the administration, he would divest some of business interests, including his stake in a major Fifth Avenue skyscraper, according to his spokeswoman Risa Heller. \n\nKushner has spent months negotiating a redevelopment of that building with Anbang Insurance Group, a real estate giant with close ties to the Chinese government, The New York Times reported on Saturday.\n\nIn addition to working through that nest of potential conflicts, Kushner has also been consulting lawyers about a federal anti-nepotism law that bars officials from appointing relatives to government positions. \n\nThe 1967 law, which was seen as a response to President John Kennedy selecting his brother Robert Kennedy as attorney general, would also be a potential obstacle for Ivanka Trump, who is also expected to have a role in her father's White House.\n\nSome Trump advisers have argued that the law does not apply to the White House, only Cabinet agencies.\n\n\"The anti-nepotism law apparently has an exception if you want to work in the West Wing, because the president is able to appoint his own staff,\" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said in December. \"The president does have discretion to choose a staff of his liking.\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0As precedent, some Trump backers have pointed to the woman the president-elect defeated in last year's bitter White House race: Hillary Clinton. President Bill Clinton's decision to put his wife in charge of his health care reform efforts was challenged in court, but two federal appeals judges said the anti-nepotism law did not appear to cover White House staff appointments.\n\nBut if Trump finds White House roles for his daughter and son-in-law, he's walking an ethical tightrope that could set a precedent for future presidents, said Norm Eisen, who served as President Barack Obama's chief ethics counselor.\n\nFor example, if the first lady's office essentially becomes the first family's office, \"it will be like institutionalizing nepotism,\" he said. \"And I think it could be politically perilous.\" At the least, Eisen said, Trump should ensure the couple is categorized as regular government employees who must routinely publicly file disclosures about their business ties and investments.\n\nIn the campaign's stretch, Kushner was a constant presence at his father-in-law's side. He has acted as a gatekeeper to Trump in the transition and has sat in on scores of high-level meetings, including Cabinet interviews.\n\nIf he takes a government post, his presence in the West Wing would add another power center in a White House that is shaping up to be top heavy. Incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior adviser Steve Bannon were announced as \"equals.\" Conway, who will serve as counselor to the president, is also likely to have autonomy and direct access to Trump.\n\nIvanka Trump has taken steps to leave her role at the Trump Organization, which the president-elect said would be run by company executives and his two adult sons, Don Jr. and Eric.\n\nIn a brief interview Friday with The Associated Press, Trump said he has a \"very simple solution\" for addressing his business ties, but would not detail the plans. He also suggested the matter was not important to Americans.\n\n\"When I won, everybody knew that I had a very big business and a very successful business,\" he said. \"The voters knew that.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.2170385122299199, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 909, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 14, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.05336305629, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170108160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9702970297029703, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/20/merkel-summons-security-leaders-in-wake-truck-attack.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [64], "\u00bd": [855]}}, "headline": "Merkel summons security leaders in wake of truck attack", "wordcount_as_scraped": 868, "date": "20161220120000", "story_content": "BERLIN \u2013 \u00a0Chancellor Angela Merkel summoned Germany's top security officials Tuesday to discuss the government's response to the deadly truck attack in Berlin that claimed at least 12 lives.\n\nNearly 50 people were injured when a truck plowed into a popular Christmas market filled with tourists and locals outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church near Berlin's Zoo station late Monday.\n\n\"There is still a lot that we don't know about this act with sufficient certainty,\" Merkel told reporters in Berlin, in her first personal statement following the incident. \"But we must, as things stand, assume it was a terrorist attack.\"\n\nPolice, too, said that the truck appeared to have been driven intentionally. So far, no group has claimed responsibility.\n\nAuthorities arrested a man about 2 kilometers (1\u00bd miles) from the crash site on suspicion of having been at the wheel of the truck.\n\nNumerous German media reported that the suspect was a Pakistani citizen. Footage showed the suspect, his head covered in a white sheet, being pushed into a police car shortly after the attack.\n\nBerlin's public radio station RBB-Inforadio cited security sources saying the man entered Germany on Dec. 31, 2015. News agency dpa, also citing unnamed security sources, said he came to Germany as a refugee in February 2016. Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the man was known to police for minor crimes.\n\nPolice declined to comment on the reports, referring questions to federal prosecutors who said they would hold a news conference Tuesday afternoon. But Merkel, who has been criticized for allowing in large numbers of migrants, addressed head-on the possibility that an asylum-seeker was responsible.\n\n\"I know that it would be particularly hard for us all to bear if it were confirmed that a person committed this act who asked for protection and asylum in Germany,\" Merkel said. \"This would be particularly sickening for the many, many Germans who work to help refugees every day and for the many people who really need our help and are making an effort to integrate in our country.\"\n\nA spokesman for Berlin's office for refugee affairs said police conducted a large-scale search overnight at a large shelter for asylum-seekers at the city's now-defunct Tempelhof airport. Four men in their late 20s were questioned but nobody was arrested, Sascha Langenbach told The Associated Press.\n\nAmong the dead was a man in the truck, who succumbed as paramedics treated him, Berlin police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said. Police said later that the man was a Polish national, but didn't give further details of who he was or what happened to him.\n\nThe Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver, his cousin, around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. \"They must have done something to my driver,\" he told TVN24.\n\nGermany has not so far experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by the Islamic State group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach, both in the southern state of Bavaria. Both attackers were killed.\n\nThose attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, contributed to tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants.\n\nFar-right groups and a nationalist party seized on Monday's attack, blaming German Chancellor Angela Merkel for what had happened.\n\n\"Under the cloak of helping people Merkel has completely surrendered our domestic security,\" Frauke Petry, the co-chairwoman of the Alternative for Germany party, wrote.\n\nManfred Weber, a member of Merkel's conservative bloc and leader of the European Parliament's biggest political grouping, cautioned against sweeping verdicts but said it was important to ensure that extremists didn't enter the country.\n\nThe German government said Merkel spoke Tuesday with President Barack Obama, who expressed his condolences. In Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the United States was ready to help in the investigation and response.\n\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Islamic extremists must be \"eradicated from the face of the earth\" and pledged to carry out that mission with all \"freedom-loving partners.\"\n\nThe attack came less than a month after the U.S. State Department warned that extremist groups including Islamic State and al-Qaida were focusing \"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events\" in Europe.\n\nThe Islamic State group and al-Qaida have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack crowds. On July 14, a truck plowed into Bastille Day revelers in the southern French city of Nice, killing 86 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France.\n\nMerkel said Monday's attack would not cause Germany to live in fear.\n\n\"Even if it's difficult at this hour we will find the strength to live life the way we want to live it in Germany. Free, together and openly,\" she said\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers David Rising and Geir Moulson in Berlin and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.411255359649661, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 845, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 16, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.99752004614, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 39, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.615384615384619, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.54545454545}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/21/trump-s-obamacare-order-could-signal-insurance-mandate-rollback.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2032, 4340]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 582, "scraper_regex": 658}}, "headline": "Trump\u2019s ObamaCare order could signal insurance mandate rollback", "wordcount_as_scraped": 658, "date": "20170121160000", "story_content": "President Trump used his first executive order late Friday to immediately undercut his predecessor's signature health care law, ordering federal agencies to ease the \"regulatory burdens\" of ObamaCare -- a move that could be aimed at rolling back the law's so-called individual mandate.\n\nThe requirement to buy insurance is one of the more unpopular components of the law. Trump's order stated clearly that his policy is to seek the \"prompt repeal\" of the Affordable Care Act, but also said his directive to agencies in the meantime is meant to minimize the economic impact of the law.\n\nThe order stated that relevant agency heads \"shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\"\n\nThe language does not specifically cite the individual mandate -- which was at the center of the Supreme Court battle under the Obama administration that ultimately left the law in place -- but was seen as a potential swipe at that provision, among others.\n\n\"It's a sign that the Trump administration is looking to unwind the law in every way it can administratively,\" said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for information and analysis about the health care system.\n\nOne distinct possibility is for the government to find new ways to grant exemptions from the law's requirement that people who remain uninsured pay fines, if deemed able to afford coverage. For example, GOP lawmakers in Congress have proposed an exemption for people in areas where only one insurer offers coverage -- currently about a third of U.S. counties.\u00a0\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Saturday that the order indeed \"appears to target the individual mandate.\"\n\nThe California Democrat, a staunch supporter of the law, warned: \"When President Trump threatens the individual mandate, he threatens the affordable health coverage of the millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nIt may take weeks or months to discern the full impact of Trump's directive. Departments like Health and Human Services and Treasury will have to issue policies that embody the new president's wishes.\n\nThe executive order may not have much impact for 2017, since government rules for this year have already been incorporated into contracts signed with insurance companies.\n\nLeslie Dach, campaign director of the Protect Our Care Coalition, issued a statement saying, \"While President Trump may have promised a smooth transition, the Executive Order does the opposite, threatening disruption for health providers and patients.\" He called the executive order \"irresponsible.\"\n\nTrump made clear he is not unilaterally suspending the Affordable Care Act. It remains on the books, and his directive instructs agencies to act within \"the maximum extent permitted by law.\"\n\nChanging the underlying law would require Congress to act, but the Trump administration can rewrite regulations carrying out the legislation. New regulations cannot be issued overnight, but would have to follow a legally established process that requires public notice and an opportunity for interested parties to comment on the administration's changes.\n\nTrump's order also directed agency heads to \"encourage the development of a free and open market in interstate commerce for the offering of healthcare services and health insurance,\" a key component of Republicans' ObamaCare replacement plan.\n\nSimultaneously, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus directed agencies Friday not to submit any new regulations to be published in the Federal Register unless a Trump-selected agency head approves it. The memo is similar to one that Obama's chief of staff issued the day Obama was inaugurated in 2009.\n\nMost of Trump's first substantive acts as president will wait until Monday, his first full work day at the White House.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.31397172808647195, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 582, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 21, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.97653815051, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170121160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.84192439862543, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/23/advancing-justice-in-2017-and-beyond.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [539, 1553, 1637, 3641, 5553]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 794, "scraper_regex": 880}}, "headline": "Five ways Trump can change the conversation about police", "wordcount_as_scraped": 880, "date": "20161123170000", "story_content": "Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in Fox News Opinion on November 23.\n\nAmerica has endured nearly eight years of bitterly divisive politics and policies regarding law enforcement. President Obama's contentious actions and rhetoric only served to drive a wedge between three quarter million law officers and the communities they serve.\n\nIt hasn't been impossible to see instances where a police officer acted in a manner that brought doubt and suspicion on their\u00a0department. But the misguided narrative that linked the actions of a very few to an entire profession has generated a wave of mistrust against law officers and gave a voice to hateful, anti-cop groups like Black Lives Matter.\n\nIn fact, were it to be fully and fairly reported, we would know of exponentially more acts of police bravery, sacrifice and heroism than the comparatively few questionable shootings of citizens.\n\nToo often in the media we see a singular theme when it comes to law enforcement \u2013 that the police are racist, over-militarized Neanderthals who sign on to abuse the rights of citizens.\n\nBut even the spin of the left only goes so far. Over a year ago, the Washington Post began collecting information on every fatal shooting by police. In doing so, they undercut their own assumptions when the 2015 tally showed just a small percentage of \"questionable\" incidents involving unarmed citizens who may not have presented a serious threat.\n\nWith that predicate, here are five recommendations for\u00a0President-elect Trump to guide him along a far different path than his predecessor:\u00a0\n\n1. Put it in perspective. Hundreds of thousands of police officers engage in tens of millions of citizen contacts every year, the vast majority of which are entirely routine and uneventful. By comparison, police use of deadly force is extraordinary and fatalities at the hands of police are anything but an epidemic.\n\nIn fact, the risk of any citizen ending up in a fatal encounter with the police starts with a decimal point followed by several zeros. Comparatively, the risk of death from homicide, falls, traffic accidents, accidental poisonings, suicide, or medical mistakes are each exponentially higher.\n\nAccording to Gallup reports, 76 percent of Americans say they have \"a great deal\" of respect for police in their area, up 12 points from last year. That's a pretty good start.\n\n2. Keep your thumb off the scale. President Obama's background in law and national platform often led him to weigh in prematurely, and inappropriately, on law enforcement matters that were nascent or where fact-finding was ongoing.\n\nDuring incidents involving Cambridge police, Treyvon Martin, Ferguson, the FBI's pending investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails; his comments came before investigators had completed their work.\n\nThe premature comments amounted to personal opinion, yet they eroded at the trust and respect for those working to complete thorough, unbiased inquiries that might, or might not, lead to criminal charges. Know what we know; exercise caution in commenting on what we don't.\n\n3. Data matters. The lack of comprehensive data available on crime and punishment in this country creates an opportunity for those who seek benefit from a false narrative.\n\nSolid intelligence based in fact, whether from investigators on the ground or from validated collection and analysis systems, can guide future decisions and investments and fill the voids now filled with speculation and opinion about police motives and actions. Strengthen data collection and analysis systems that would truly inform. \u00a0\n\n4. Use your words and actions wisely. Build up rather than break down and recognize that the imagery of where you go, what you do and who you're with has great power.\n\nWe saw this as the president aligned himself with groups that were anti-police during the height of the debate. Building enduring coalitions locally or nationally includes recognition that black lives do matter, just like blue lives, and, yes, all lives; however, groups that presume their own viewpoints are only those worthy of consideration should be rejected.\n\n5. Invest, invest, invest. In too many places, America's police are expected to do far too much with far too little. From Philly to Cleveland to Oakland, patrol officers start their shift with 911 calls stacked in their queue, riding from crisis to crisis with little time to invest in developing community relationships that might later flower into pockets of trust.\n\nToo large a proportion of their encounters will come emotionally disturbed persons who defy treatment and police direction \u2013 the product of an ineffectual, fragmented mental health system.\n\nOthers will come from youth and adults who failed to attend school or learned little as a result of poor education systems and families lacking discipline.\n\nThe new administration should invest in hiring, training, equipping, and leading police officers across the country.\n\nCommunity policing, crisis intervention and de-escalation training, and tools like body cameras are only beneficial if the right training and leadership is behind them.\n\nAmerica's policing and criminal justice systems are at a crossroads. The president-elect should take a serious look at mistakes of the past and work to build an infrastructure that would restore trust and confidence in our law enforcement and increase faith in a system that encounters, treats, diverts, deters, and punishes appropriately.\n\n\n\nRon Hosko is president of the\u00a0Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, and former assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.74331545829773, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 794, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.7921188390199996, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161123170000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.77833753148615, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/16/brazil-struggles-to-curb-prison-violence-that-has-killed-125.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [77]}}, "headline": "Brazil struggles to curb prison violence that has killed 125", "wordcount_as_scraped": 904, "date": "20170117060000", "story_content": "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2013 \u00a0Brazilian authorities are scrambling to stop a wave of prison violence that has killed at least 125 inmates in two weeks, many with their heads cut off or their hearts and intestines ripped out.\n\nThree massacres and many smaller fatal clashes, all in northern states, have followed a pattern that security forces have been unable to get ahead of. It starts with an hours-long riot inside a penitentiary, then military police are sent in to assist severely outnumbered guards and distraught families wait outside while inmates post on social media photos they take of chopped up body parts.\n\nThe factors fueling the violence among rival gang members are so complex that authorities say some potential remedies could exacerbate the problem. And the possibility of continued killings is raising fears the violence could spill into favelas, or slums, in major cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, where drug operations are run in conjunction with bosses in prisons.\n\n\"Stopping the bloodshed begins with the federal and state governments calling this what it is: a public emergency,\" said Robert Muggah, research director for the Igarape Institute, a Brazil-based think tank that focuses on security. \"This is a problem from hell that has been festering for half a century.\"\n\nPresident Michel Temer was initially slow to respond, taking three days to publicly acknowledge the first massacre, and he was ridiculed for calling it a \"terrible accident.\" But the government has since announced a series of measures aimed at stopping the violence.\n\nNational guard troops are being dispatched to hot spots, thousands of inmates are being shuffled among prisons and Temer has announced plans to build five new lockups. Meanwhile, justice authorities are examining ways to speed up a legal process that keeps thousands locked up for months or years while their cases are processed.\n\nNothing seems to be working so far. After several days of relative calm, 26 inmates were killed late Saturday in clashes inside two adjoining prisons in the northern state of Rio Grande do Norte. Authorities said members of the Sao Paulo-based First Command, Brazil's largest criminal gang known by the Portuguese acronym PCC, fought with local gang Crime Syndicate of Rio Grande do Norte.\n\nAuthorities said military police would not enter the prisons until daylight Sunday because it was too dangerous.\n\n\"There are more than 1,000 prisoners, all out of their cells, and some are armed,\" military police Maj. Wellington Camilo da Silva told reporters. \"What we are doing now is trying to avoid a massive escape.\"\n\nPrisoners returned to their cells by Sunday, and police found 26 bodies, many of them decapitated.\n\nThe wave of violence began with the arrival of the new year, when 56 inmates were killed in the northern state of Amazonas. Authorities said the Family of the North gang targeted members of the First Command in a clash over control of drug-trafficking routes in northern states. Many were decapitated, their heads tossed outside prison walls.\n\nThen on Jan. 6, in the neighboring state of Roraima, 33 prisoners were killed, many with their hearts and intestines ripped out. Authorities said First Command members instigated the bloodshed against other prisoners for motives not entirely clear.\n\nTen other inmates were killed in smaller prison clashes in Amazonas and the northeastern state of Paraiba during the first few days of the month.\n\nThe central problem that authorities are trying to address is extreme overcrowding, which exacerbates squalid conditions that include infestations of rats and poisonous centipedes.\n\nBrazil had 622,000 prisoners in 2014, compared to 233,000 in 2000, according to Ministry of Justice data. Brazil's prisons combined were built to house roughly half the current number.\n\nWhile new facilities would help ease overcrowding, it could take years to build them.\n\nA more realistic option would be to reduce the number be people behind bars, experts say. Several studies have found that around 40 percent of Brazil's inmates have not even been convicted and are in cells waiting for their cases to be heard. Many of them survive by joining gangs, which recruit members while providing protection and financial support.\n\nLast week, Chief Supreme Court Justice Carmen Lucia called on authorities in each state to undertake an expedited analysis of all inmates who have not been convicted. Lucia said the idea wasn't to release people, but determine cases in which house arrest would be feasible.\n\nAny large-scale release would likely be met with sharp resistance from politicians and citizens, however. \"A good criminal is a dead criminal\" is a common phrase in a country where violence permeates daily life.\n\nPrison authorities have been moving thousands of prisoners in a kind of cat-and-mouse game aimed at stopping gang leaders from ordering new hits and saving inmates who could be targeted. But that strategy also carries risks. Prisoners not associated with a gang can be exposed to dangers in new prisons, while veteran gang members can court fresh recruits.\n\nMany experts argue that the way authorities have handled First Command members behind bars over the past decade is at the root of the latest bloodshed.\n\n\"Transferring PCC leaders to other states made the group even more national,\" said Graham Denyer Willis, a lecturer at Cambridge University and author of \"The Consensus Killing,\" on police and First Command violence in Sao Paulo. \"It was a wrong policy then and it is still now.\"\n\n___\n\nPeter Prengaman on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/peterprengaman\n\nMauricio Savarese on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/MSavarese\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.93795967102051, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 878, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 15, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 21, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.61203510762, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 54, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.150341685649201, "mft_mean": 4.909090909090001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/10/cloud-hangs-over-obama-return-to-chicago.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [498, 5124, 5174]}}, "headline": "Cloud hangs over Obama return to Chicago", "wordcount_as_scraped": 866, "date": "20170110210000", "story_content": "As President Obama returns to his adopted hometown of Chicago to give his farewell speech Tuesday night, a dark cloud hangs over the city where the record-setting murder rate is so high there are pleas to declare a state of emergency.\n\n\"When there is a fire in America, a tornado, a hurricane, they call it a state of emergency, federal funds come in, and help rebuild that town or that community,\" said prominent anti-crime activist, Father Michael Pfleger.\u00a0 \"Well, hell, we have a state of emergency in Chicago.\"\n\nIn 2016, 762 people were murdered in Chicago. That's a 63 percent increase from the 468 murders recorded in 2015 and almost double the murders in 2014, according to Chicago Police.\n\nShootings also are way up -- 4,331 people were shot in Chicago in 2016, up from 3,550 in 2015, according to police.\n\nIn recent months, the president has been mostly quiet about an aggressive solution to Chicago's violent crime epidemic. The city saw more murders in 2016 than New York and Los Angeles combined, yet is considerably smaller in population than either city. Chicagoans wonder if the president will address the city's crime \u2013 the \"elephant in the room\" \u2013 during his speech Tuesday night.\n\n\"I cannot recall a time that President Obama said directly about Rahm Emanuel that he needs to do something about this violence,\" said Chicago community leader and activist Pastor Corey Brooks.\n\nIn a series of interviews last week previewing his speech and visit to Chicago, Obama discussed the city's carnage, noting a lot of the crime is happening in the \"backyard\" of the home he and the first lady own on the city's South Side.\n\n\"We've been trying even from the federal level to provide assistance to the city. I don't think that we're going to be able to reverse these things overnight,\" Obama said. \"On the other hand, the fact that crime overall is much lower around the country when it was when I took office and that Chicago is the one big city where you've seen this huge spike means that there's something specifically happening there and that means we can fix it if we work together.\"\n\nCommunity leaders all agree Chicago's violent crime and murder rate is unacceptable but the exact cause and how to fix it is a matter of debate. The issues most often pointed to are the city's uncontrollable illegal gun market, gang wars, cheap heroin and increasing disrespect for law enforcement.\n\nFormer Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who is credited with a drop in the city's crime up until 2015 through his community-policing approach, says officers haven't felt a ton of support from the Obama administration.\n\n\"I can't help but just look at criminal justice, and criminal justice in this country has not had a friend in the federal government during this administration,\" McCarthy said.\n\nLori Lightfoot, president of the Chicago Police Board\u2014an independent entity tasked with investigating complaints into misconduct and corruption\u2014says Chicago's crime is not something police can arrest their way out of and requires all levels of the government and community to work together beyond analyzing crime stats and police performance.\n\n\"We need to make sure we are out there with job training, everything we can to drive down unemployment, make sure kids aren't living in poverty, good schools,\" Lightfoot said. \"This really does take a multi-faceted approach.\"\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has already weighed in, making headlines when he tweeted that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel should seek federal help if he can't fix the city's crime\u2014which also raises the question if policing in the city and even nationwide might grow beyond a state and local operation under the Trump administration.\n\n\"President-Elect Trump is directly putting the ball in the mayor's court and that's the way it should be,\" Brooks said.\n\nEmanuel's spokesperson replied to the Trump tweet with a statement, in part writing, \"As the president-elect knows from his conversation with the mayor, we agree the federal government has a strong role to play in public safety\u2026we are heartened he is taking this issue seriously and look forward to working with the new administration on these important efforts.\"\n\nAll this comes as the Department of Justice is in the midst of a patterns and practice investigation into the Chicago Police Department for allegations of racism and police brutality. This follows the release of a highly controversial, graphic dash cam video depicting a Chicago police officer shooting and killing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.\n\nThe DOJ's findings are expected to be released before or shortly after the inauguration of Trump on Jan. 20 and could result in an expensive Consent Decree with CPD that will continue to keep Chicago's crime problems in the national spotlight.\n\nPfleger said he reached out to Trump during the campaign but did not hear back. He says he hopes the DOJ's findings and the new administration could make a difference in Chicago.\n\n\"The question being will they reach out and want to really see some substantive changes and make a difference or do they\u00a0just want to continue to Band-Aid,\" Pfleger said.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMatt Finn is a Fox News correspondent based in the Chicago bureau.

Seeing the piles of rubble, they figured their lives were over.\n\nLess than two years later, the community is cleaning up their World Heritage Site themselves, and one of the world's leading architects has taken on the recovery as his pet project.\n\n\"I see now our world coming back alive,\" said Gyan Bahadur Bhadal, 61, one of many villagers who share responsibility for the temple's upkeep.\n\nIn a country where locals say there are more gods than people and more temples than houses, Changu Narayan still manages to stand out among the ancient holy places. It's believed to be the oldest Hindu place of worship in the country, its wooden walls intricately carved with hundreds of deities, perched atop a steep hill overlooking the Kathmandu Valley.\n\nThe 5th century temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, who locals say appeared there once. His image, in about a dozen incarnations, is carved into struts that hold up the roof. Stone lions with eagle heads guard the doors. Inside has long been a mystery: Only priests enter the two-tiered pagoda, and they don't explore.\n\nAn April 2015 temblor that killed 9,000 people in Nepal also damaged details in Changu Narayan's wood, stone and metal. A sharp aftershock one day later twisted the entire structure, knocking piles of bricks out of the walls, filling the courtyard.\n\nAnish Bhatta's family has been living and leading worship at the temple for 10 generations \u2014 some 325 years. After the earthquake, Anish did the unthinkable: He went all the way inside.\n\n\"We saw things we never imagined,\" he said. \"Statues as big as me, swords, so many sculptures, gold plated with big gems.\"\n\nToday the temple is guarded by military police, and propped up with questionable temporary beams.\n\nBritish architect John Sanday, who led the World Monuments Fund restoration of Cambodia's Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world, fell in love with the place decades ago. After the earthquake, he came up the Changu path with trepidation.\n\n\"I was very emotional walking into this place. The whole of the courtyard was littered with rubble. I thought, 'Come on, John, you've got to pull yourself together,'\" he recalled.\n\nBut then Sanday noticed wooden supports exposed by the missing brick. He saw what looked like a bedrock foundation. And he decided that of the 600 historical temples, monuments and palaces damaged by the earthquake in Nepal, this one would be his project.\n\n\"Sure, it's peanuts, a little temple, so why is it so special?\" said Sanday. \"The detail. The grace. It's one of the few World Heritage Sites that hasn't been completely destroyed by development.\"\n\nBut what really drew him to step in as technical adviser were the people of this village.\n\nAmong tourists and pilgrims, Changu Narayan's residents pray there at dusk, kneel at the deities, bow to the gods, offer alms to the priests who stand duty at the door.\n\nThree people died and 100 homes were damaged in Changu Village, a 30-minute drive from downtown Kathmandu, during the earthquake. Like families in the city 12.5 miles (20 kilometers) away, the Changu community grieved, cried and cleaned up rubble.\n\nBut in the hilltop village the community did something else: With rags and water, little picks and brushes, they cleaned the ancient and exotic carved brackets and facades, cleaning and repairing, bit by bit, so they could resume their worship. Now Sanday says their dedication is his inspiration. He will not allow their culture to disappear with the damaged building.\n\nConserving an ancient building means solving a series of incredibly complicated puzzles. Rotted or mice-chewed timbers must be replaced. An unstable and stretched government bureaucracy must remain in charge. And there's $300,000 to raise.\n\nFor starters, with $30,000 of German support, he helped the community rebuild one of Changu's shrines, the size of a little guardhouse. Now he's looking at the larger temple a few yards away.\n\n\"This is a place we can save, no doubt,\" said Sanday. \"The people here will make sure of that.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.13368983566761, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 656, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.6095818353499998, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 4, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170116060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.2012195121951197, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/22/judge-andrew-napolitano-america-at-christmas.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4639]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 816, "scraper_regex": 865}}, "headline": "Judge Andrew Napolitano: America at Christmas", "wordcount_as_scraped": 865, "date": "20161222060000", "story_content": "What if Christmas is a core value of belief in a personal God who lived among us and His freely given promise of eternal salvation that no believer should reject or apologize for?

Security Council to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem could spur moves toward new terms to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But it also poses dangers for the United Nations with the incoming Trump administration and may harden Israel's attitude toward concessions.\n\nThe Obama administration's decision to abstain and allow the U.N.'s most powerful body to approve a long-sought resolution calling Israeli settlements \"a flagrant violation under international law\" was a sharp rebuke to a longstanding ally and a striking rupture with past U.S. vetoes.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said \"it is because this resolution reflects the facts on the ground \u2014 and is consistent with U.S. policy across Republican and Democratic administrations throughout the history of the state of Israel \u2014 that the United States did not veto it.\"\n\nShe cited a 1982 statement by then-President Ronald Reagan that the United States \"will not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlements\" and that \"settlement activity is in no way necessary for the security of Israel.\"\n\nThe Security Council vote Friday, however, was anything but routine for Washington, which traditionally vetoes all resolutions related to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict on grounds that differences must be solved through negotiations. It was the first resolution on the conflict approved during President Barack Obama's nearly eight years in office and shone a spotlight on his icy relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe U.S. decision to abstain on the 14-0 vote followed months of intensely secret deliberations in Washington, a spate of fresh Israeli settlement announcements that sparked exasperation and anger from American officials, and recent attempts by Israel's government to have parliament legalize thousands of homes built on privately owned Palestinian land.\n\nAfter Egypt suddenly postponed a scheduled vote on the resolution Thursday, reportedly under pressure from Israel and supporters of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, four new sponsors stepped up and pushed it through \u2014 Malaysia, New Zealand, Venezuela and Senegal, each representing a different region and reflecting the wide support for the measure.\n\nTrump demanded that Obama veto the resolution and tweeted after the vote, \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th\" \u2014 when Trump takes office.\n\nIt would be virtually impossible, however, for Trump to overturn the resolution. It would require a new resolution with support from at least nine members in the 15-member Security Council and no veto by one of the other permanent members \u2014 Russia, China, Britain or France, all of whom supported Friday's resolution.\n\nRepublicans, who control Congress, immediately threatened consequences. Sen. Lindsay Graham, who heads the Senate panel in charge of U.S. payments to the U.N., said he would \"form a bipartisan coalition to suspend or significantly reduce\" funding. He added that countries receiving U.S. aid could also be penalized for supporting the resolution.\n\nUnder U.N. rules, failure to pay dues leads to the loss of voting privileges in the General Assembly.\n\nThe vote on settlements sparked behind-the-scenes discussion in the usually divided Security Council on what else might be achieved on the Israeli-Palestinian issue while Obama is still in the White House.\n\nNew Zealand has been pressing for the council to consider a resolution that would set out the parameters for a settlement of the conflict, and its draft ideas remain on the table.\n\nBut Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon warned the council after the vote that the resolution would not spur peace efforts.\n\n\"By voting 'yes' in favor of this resolution, you have in fact voted 'no,'\" Danon said. \"You voted 'no' to negotiations. You voted 'no' to progress, and a chance for better lives for Israelis and Palestinians. And you voted 'no' to the possibility of peace.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately retaliated against some of the nations that proposed Friday's resolution. He recalled his nation's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal for consultations, canceled a planned January visit to Israel by Senegal's foreign minister and ended Israeli aid programs to the West African nation.\n\n\"Israel rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution at the U.N. and will not abide by its terms,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement.\n\nThe Israeli leader blamed Obama for failing to \"protect Israel against this gang-up at the U.N.\" and even colluding with its detractors. He said, \"Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with all our friends in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.\"\n\nBy contrast, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat hailed the result as a \"victory for the justice of the Palestinian cause.\" He said Trump's choice was now between \"international legitimacy\" or siding with \"settlers and extremists.\"\n\nRiyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, urged the Security Council to \"stand firm by this decision\" and \"not be cowed by negative threats or spin.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.24971866607666, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 778, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.0061935521, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161224080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.72750642673522, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/19/homeless-across-country-fall-victim-to-synthetic-marijuana.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [70, 3634, 3641]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 674, "scraper_regex": 710}}, "headline": "Homeless across country fall victim to synthetic marijuana", "wordcount_as_scraped": 710, "date": "20161219150000", "story_content": "ST. LOUIS \u2013 \u00a0The nation's homeless are proving to be especially susceptible to a new, dirt-cheap version of synthetic marijuana, which leaves users glassy-eyed, aimless, sprawled on streets and sidewalks oblivious to their surroundings or wandering into traffic.\n\nNearly 300 homeless people became ill last month in St. Louis due to the man-made hallucinogen that experts believe is far more dangerous and unpredictable than the real thing. Other outbreaks have occurred in New York City, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.\n\n\"It was common for us to see reactions where they were violent, incoherent, sometimes catatonic on the ground,\" Austin police Lt. Kurt Thomas said.\n\nThe homeless are easy targets in a confined area, experts say. The drug is cheap \u2014 as little as $1 or $2 for a joint \u2014 more difficult to detect in drug tests and is a fast escape from a harsh reality.\n\nThings got so bad in St. Louis last month that the region's largest provider of homeless services urged people to stop giving the homeless handouts, because they were worried the money would be used to buy the drug.\n\nThe Rev. Larry Rice saw the odd behaviors from several homeless people in the streets outside his New Life Evangelistic Center shelter in downtown St. Louis.\n\n\"They told me, 'You get so low, you get such a sense of hopelessness. Somebody wants to sell this for a dollar and you take it,'\" Rice said. \"People are desperate out there.\"\n\nSynthetic marijuana has been around since the late 2000s, packaged under names like K2, Darkness and Mr. Happy. The Drug Enforcement Administration says it is usually a mixture of herbs and spices sprayed with a synthetic compound chemically similar to THC, the psychoactive ingredients in marijuana. It is typically manufactured in China and sold in places like head shops, but it's also on the street and over the internet.\n\nState legislatures have outlawed it based on its chemical makeup, but the makers tweak the formula enough that it escapes the provisions of the law. So far in St. Louis, only one charge has been filed \u2014 a homeless man accused of selling to others on the street.\n\n\"You factor in some of the despair or difficult circumstances that these folks are going through, and they often fall prey to the suppliers offering an outlet to deal with their unfortunate situation,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe medical dangers are real with synthetic marijuana, which can be up to 100 times more potent than real marijuana, said Dr. Anthony Scalzo, director of toxicology for the Saint Louis University School of Medicine.\n\nUsers often experience rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, anxiety and hallucinations, he said.\n\nResearch published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated that 20 deaths from August 2011 through April 2015 were blamed on synthetic marijuana, though that doesn't account for overdose deaths of undetermined or multiple causes. Scalzo said those who survive can suffer permanent kidney failure and brain damage.\n\n\"We have no idea how the body is going to react to the next wave of chemicals,\" Scalzo said. \"It's like Russian roulette. You just don't know what you're getting.\"\n\nDuring one outbreak in Brooklyn in July, 130 people were hospitalized. Witnesses said many of users were shaking or leaning aimlessly against trees and fire hydrants.\n\nIn emergency room interviews, users said they would prefer to smoke real marijuana but took the synthetic drug to avoid detection in urine tests typically mandated for probation and parole issues and other reasons, according to Michelle Nolan of the New York City\u00a0Health\u00a0Department.\n\n\"For individuals still using a psychoactive substance, this afforded them, criminally speaking, fewer risks,\" Nolan said.\n\nThe Skid Row area of downtown Los Angeles saw the scourge over a few days in August, when 36 people were treated for overdoses. Some had seizures, others staggered through traffic or collapsed on curbs.\n\nAround 150 homeless people have overdosed on synthetic marijuana since August in Austin, and one death was blamed on the drug, Thomas said. Police and homeless advocates in Austin are warning those on the street to avoid the temptation to use, but know it's an uphill battle.\n\n\"Being realistic, we're always going to have a group of folks who are willing to engage in self-destructive behavior,\" Thomas said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.98282718658447, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 674, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.4431370787600002, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161219150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.78041543026706, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/12/kasich-under-pressure-from-both-sides-as-major-abortion-bills-hit-desk.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [799, 989, 1050, 1248, 1459, 1527, 1675, 2648, 3836]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 662, "scraper_regex": 706}}, "headline": "Kasich under pressure from both sides as major abortion bills hit desk", "wordcount_as_scraped": 706, "date": "20161212210000", "story_content": "Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who built a reputation during the raucous GOP presidential primaries as an affable and moderate alternative, is suddenly finding himself at the center of the national abortion debate -- and under pressure to cast a decision bound to make him more unpopular with one side or the other.\n\nTwo bills passed by the legislature await his signature or veto. If signed into law, they would become two of the most restrictive time-based abortion measures in the country.\n\nThe more controversial is known as the \"heartbeat bill.\" It would ban abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected -- roughly around the six-week mark. The second prohibits abortions after the 20-week mark in almost all circumstances.\u00a0\n\nKasich, who said during the Republican presidential primaries that he's \"pro-life with the exceptions of rape, incest and the life of the mother,\" faces a looming deadline for a decision.\u00a0\n\nAfter receiving the bills, he has 10 days to sign or veto.\u00a0\n\nIf he does nothing, the bills become law. However, with the \"heartbeat bill\" which passed as an amendment to another measure, the governor could use his line item veto and nix only the amendment.\u00a0\n\nThe \"heartbeat bill\" passed last Tuesday, and the 20-week ban passed the following day.\n\nKasich's press secretary Emmalee Kalmbach told FoxNews.com the governor's office has not officially received the bills.\u00a0\n\nSo far, the governor's office has stayed quiet on his intentions.\u00a0\n\n\"A hallmark of lame duck is a flood of bills, including, bills inside of bills and we will closely examine everything we receive,\" Kalmbach said.\u00a0\n\nAnti-abortion advocates are fighting hard against the \"heartbeat bill,\" arguing it would in some cases prohibit abortion before women even realize they are pregnant. Critics argue such a strict cut-off denies women time to weigh their options.\n\nThe bill also includes no exceptions for rape or incest and would criminalize the procedure for doctors.\n\nNARAL Pro-Choice Ohio Executive Director Kellie Copeland said the bill is \"out of touch with Ohio values and is completely unacceptable.\"\n\n\"Once a woman has made the decision to end a pregnancy, she needs access to safe, legal healthcare in her community,\" Copeland said in a written statement. \"This bill would effectively outlaw abortion and criminalize physicians that provide this care to their patients.\"\n\nIf Kasich signs the bill, it would pose a direct challenge to multiple Supreme Court rulings that say women have a constitutional right to abortion until the point of viability, which occurs around 24 weeks. \u00a0\n\nSimilar \"heartbeat\" bills in North Dakota and Arkansas were blocked by lower courts this year. They were appealed to the Supreme Court, which refused to hear the cases in January.\n\nBut conservative lawmakers in Ohio say this year may be different.\n\nThey point to the presidential election of Donald Trump and cite his campaign promise to appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade, a 1973 decision that made abortion legal, as a positive sign the legislation has a shot.\n\n\"A new president, new Supreme Court appointees change the dynamic, and there was consensus in our caucus to move forward,\" Senate President Keith Faber recently told reporters, adding that he believes the bill's chance of surviving a constitutional challenge is greater now.\n\nBut if the measure becomes law, the ACLU has already vowed to fight it.\n\nThe ACLU of Ohio tweeted, \"Just a reminder, if the unconstitutional #HeartBeatBill passes and become law, we will challenge it in court.\"\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization that supports pro-choice and tracks abortion legislation, said if the measures become law, they would be some of the most restrictive in the land. \u00a0\n\nIn the four decades since Roe v. Wade was handed down, states have enacted 1,074 abortion restrictions. Of those, 288 \u2013 or about 27 percent \u2013 have been put in place since 2010, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThe 20-week \"pain capable\" bill, meanwhile, would change the time abortions could be performed to 20 weeks from 26 weeks, which is the current law in Ohio.\n\nSince he's been in office, Kasich has signed 17 bills sponsored by Ohio Right to Life. If Kasich signs the \"pain capable\" bill, Ohio would become the 15th state in the nation to pass a 20-week abortion ban.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.7001237869262695, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 662, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.62221910943, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161212210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0211480362537797, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/14/pellets-fired-to-quell-protests-blind-hundreds-kashmiris.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [77]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 535, "scraper_regex": 578}}, "headline": "Pellets fired to quell protests blind hundreds of Kashmiris", "wordcount_as_scraped": 578, "date": "20161214070000", "story_content": "SRINAGAR, India \u2013 \u00a0Indian authorities call the shotgun shells filled with hundreds of small metal pellets a \"non-lethal\" weapon for crowd control, but that does not make them harmless. They've inflicted a permanent toll on hundreds of Kashmiris hit by them.\n\nTheir faces are scarred. Their eyes are damaged or simply gone, replaced with prosthetics. And their psychological wounds run deeper still.\n\n\"What I miss most is being able to read the holy Quran,\" says Firdous Ahmad Dar, 25, a Kashmiri man who lost vision in both eyes after being shot with the pellets during an anti-India protest in the troubled Himalayan region.\n\nThe pellets have been in use here since 2010. Soldiers are trained to fire the shotguns below protesters' waists, causing immense pain but \u2014 in theory \u2014 no permanent injuries. But a police official acknowledged that the rules are \"more or less not followed because of the intensity of stone-throwing protests. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with department policy.\n\nThe latest wave of protests began in early July after Indian troops killed Burhan Wani, a young and charismatic militant commander. As government troops cracked down on angry street protests in the Kashmir valley, shotguns were their weapon of choice.\n\nHealth officials say that in the past five months more than 6,000 people, mostly young men, have been injured by shotgun pellets, including hundreds blinded in one or both eyes. Police and hospital officials say the pellets have killed at least eight people, though a prominent local rights group, Jammu-Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, says the death toll from the pellets is 18.\n\nInternational groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have called for an end to the use of shotguns, which shower pellets widely. In July, Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh cautioned security forces to minimize use of the weapons, but that warning had little apparent effect. As recently as last week, at least 30 people were injured when troops fired shotguns to quell rock-throwing protests.\n\nSome of those injured were protesters, others just bystanders.\n\nInsha Mushtaq Malik, 14, was standing by the window of her village home watching protesters and troops skirmish when more than 100 pellets hit her face. She lost both eyes.\n\n\"Everything looks dark and black,\" she says, as smiles and sadness take turns flitting across her face. Five months after she lost her eyes, Malik is still learning how to deal with her loss, both emotionally and practically. She needs help with everything, including climbing the stairs, going to the bathroom and getting dressed.\n\nPhotojournalist Xuhaib Maqbool ended up losing vision in his left eye as he shot images of protesters chanting anti-India slogans and demanding \"azadi\" \u2014 freedom from Indian rule.\n\nHe says he clearly raised his camera to show the soldier who shot at him that he was not a protester.\n\n\"I want to ask him why,\" he says.\n\nA cycle of violence is repeating itself constantly in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Angry protests are quelled by force that in turn feeds more simmering rage.\n\nBut sometimes all it leaves behind is pain and helplessness.\n\nFor Dar, it means being completely dependent on the family he once supported by driving an autorickshaw.\n\n\"My dream was to educate my young siblings, but now they are helping me,\" he says.\n\nThe rest of his family is busy in the courtyard preparing for his sister's wedding. Dar now has no role to play. \"Very old men are now looking after young men.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.67973852157593, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 535, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.72487872373, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9906542056074796, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/20/trump-pursues-new-vision-on-first-day-as-president.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [335, 580, 796, 1064, 3191, 3361, 3716, 4107, 4273]}}, "headline": "Trump pursues 'new vision' on first day as president", "wordcount_as_scraped": 752, "date": "20170121100000", "story_content": "Vowing to \"get the job done,\" President Trump took office Friday outlining a drastically different agenda than that of his predecessor and installing key members of his national security team \u2013 as he began the work of turning his bold, and often brash, campaign promises into action.\u00a0\n\nHe took the first steps Friday evening, signing an executive order directing agencies to ease the burdens of the Affordable Care Act. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus also directed agencies to impose an \"immediate regulatory freeze.\"\u00a0\n\n\"The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action,\" Trump declared in his inaugural address earlier on the West Front of the Capitol, issuing a fiery condemnation of business as usual in Washington.\u00a0\n\nThe president presided over the traditional inaugural fanfare, taking part in the parade down Pennsylvania Avenue before an evening of balls and other festivities. But on the sidelines, his team already was making its mark, part of what Trump called a \"new vision.\"\u00a0\n\nThe official White House website swiftly switched as Trump took the oath of office, reflecting a new agenda for the new administration.\n\nAt the top of the \"issues\" section was Trump's \"America First Energy Plan,\" which included a commitment to nix Obama-era policies to curb global warming and regulate U.S. waterways.\n\nTeam Trump deemed them \"harmful and unnecessary policies\" that hurt the economy. \"Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years,\" the website now states.\n\nThe site posted additional plans for the military, foreign policy, the economy and more. The jobs plan committed to \"pro-growth tax reform\" including a reduction in the corporate tax rate.\n\nIn terms of official actions, Trump's first day consisted mostly of routine transfer-of-power measures. He signed nomination papers for his Cabinet picks \u2013 but also his first bill, legislation allowing retired Gen. James Mattis to serve as Defense secretary.\n\nThe Senate later confirmed Mattis to lead the Pentagon, as well as retired Gen. John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Democrats angered GOP colleagues by resisting efforts to consider more Cabinet nominees on the first day.\n\nBut bigger and more visceral battles were playing out on the streets of Washington Friday, as anti-Trump protesters swarmed parts of the District in demonstrations that turned violent at times. Amid dozens of arrests, protesters smashed the windows of businesses, forced the temporary shutdown of security checkpoints and clashed with police \u2013 who used pepper spray and tear gas to try to control the crowds.\n\nBut thousands of Trump supporters also came out, watching the 45th president's inaugural address from the National Mall and later the parade, at times drowning out the protesters with cheers.\n\nThe address itself was heavy on populist themes, and stitched together by an appeal for a \"new national pride,\" as Trump described patriotism as a salve for the country's divisions.\n\n\"When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,\" he said.\u00a0\n\nHe also rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while \"the people did not share\" in Washington's wealth.\u00a0\n\nIn blunt and unvarnished terms similar to the language used during his nomination acceptance address last summer, Trump lamented the jobs lost to foreign rivals \u2013 he described \"rusted out factories scattered like tombstones\" across the land \u2013 and the crime in America's cities.\n\n\"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\" Trump said.\u00a0\n\nTrump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down.\n\n\"From this day forward, it's going to be only America first,\" Trump said. \"I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. \u2026 We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.\"\u00a0\n\nTelling the American people this is \"your moment\" and \"your day,\" Trump closed his speech with the promise that started it all: \"We will make America great again.\"\u00a0\n\nAs Barack and Michelle Obama departed the White House after eight years in office, Trump will immediately be confronted with the challenge of governing, as he attempts to apply his CEO experience to running the nation. His team has vowed a \"robust\" start to the Trump administration, which could include everything from rescinding controversial Obama actions to renegotiating trade deals to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.5492467880249, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 741, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.7482778414699998, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170121100000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.9136302294197, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/29/proposed-syria-peace-deal-could-slash-assads-power-report-claims.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [272, 393, 756, 1837]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 629, "scraper_regex": 727}}, "headline": "Proposed Syria peace deal could slash Assad's power, report claims", "wordcount_as_scraped": 727, "date": "20161229160000", "story_content": "Russia and Turkey have pushed a deal to end Syria's nearly-six-year-long civil war -- which could leave the dictator Bashar al-Assad with much less power than before, and eventually force him out of office,\u00a0Reuters reported.\n\nRussia, Turkey and Iran -- leaving out the United States -- were crafting the potential deal ahead of\u00a0Thursday's cease-fire announcement, sources told the news agency on Wednesday.

They added that Assad would stay in office for at least a few years.\n\nAmong the power shifts: Turkey could see more control over northern Syria, potentially using part of the land as a base for anti-Assad rebels, whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government supports.\n\nBoth Russia and Iran have provided major backing to Assad's fighters, in the form of Iranian soldiers and Russian airpower. While Iran has been slow to make compromises at the bargaining table, the sources said Tehran agreed to talk after Turkey dropped its push to force Assad from power immediately.\n\nStill, Iran's name was noticeably left out of the truce agreement announced Thursday. Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin said Moscow and Turkey would guarantee the cease-fire.\n\n\"Our priority is not to see Assad go, but for terrorism to be defeated,\" a senior Turkish government official told Reuters. \"It doesn't mean we approve of Assad. But we have come to an understanding.\"\n\nSyria's military said it agreed to a nationwide cease-fire starting at midnight, adding that it paved the way for reactivating negotiations to end the civil war entirely.\n\n\"News of a ceasefire in the Syrian civil war is a positive development,\" U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner said in a statement. \"We hope it will be implemented fully and respected by all parties. Any effort that stops the violence, saves lives, and creates the conditions for renewed and productive political negotiations would be welcome.\"\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the truce would include 62,000 opposition fighters across Syria, and that the Russian military has established a hotline with its Turkish counterpart to monitor compliance.\n\nIt comes on the heels of the Syrian army's retaking control of Aleppo, Syria's largest city, ending the opposition's four-year hold over parts of the city.\n\nPutin said he ordered the Russian military to scale down its presence in Syria, where it has provided crucial support to Assad's forces. Putin didn't say how many troops and weapons would be withdrawn. He said Russia would continue \"fighting international terrorism in Syria\" and supporting Assad's military.\n\nPutin also said that the Russian military would maintain its presence at both an air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia and the naval facility in the Syrian port of Tartus.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called on Hezbollah to withdraw its fighters from Syria. The group, which has sent thousands of fighters to support Assad, has been playing an instrumental role in Syria's civil war since 2013, mostly in areas near the border with Lebanon, the suburbs of the capital Damascus and the northern city of Aleppo. The group is not likely to withdraw from Syria in the near future as its leader repeatedly said that their presence there is mostly to prevent attacks by extremists deep inside Lebanon.\n\nForeign fighters from around the world have joined both sides of the Syrian conflict that has so far killed more than quarter a million people, displaced half the country's population and produced more than four millions refugees.\n\nSyria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem had said that fighters from more than 80 countries have joined insurgent groups trying to remove Assad from power while the Syrian government is backed by fighters from countries including Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Russia.\n\nFox News' Greg Palkot and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.39099860191345, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 629, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.58831897382, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.9284578696343395, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/07/5-reasons-your-gums-bleed-when-brush.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [106, 112, 164, 169, 358, 624, 1158, 1174, 1348, 1375, 1536, 1553, 1600, 1636, 1654, 1818, 2037, 2054, 2175, 2191, 2340, 2521, 2546, 2573, 2582, 2586, 2591, 2727, 2735, 2798]}}, "headline": "5 reasons your gums bleed when you brush", "wordcount_as_scraped": 497, "date": "20161207110000", "story_content": "The night before a teeth cleaning, most of us like to get in there\u00a0deep.\u00a0We floss and brush the pants off our chompers, then\u00a0spit\u00a0a couple drops of blood into the sink. But here's the thing: \"Bleeding from the gums is never normal,\" says periodontist Sally Cram, D.D.S. It's actually a red flag for gum disease (a.k.a.\u00a0gingivitis, or inflammation of the gums), which stems from the buildup of bacteria and plaque on your teeth. You don't want gum disease\u2014it can weak havoc on your mouth (we're talking tooth loss) and body (it's been linked to heart disease, yo).\n\nAggressive brushing\u00a0isn't the only cause of bloody gums\u2014there are actually a number of triggers (not all in your control) that can lead to that pink spit. Take a look so you know how to step in or when to ping the dentist.\n\n\"It only takes 24 hours for bacteria to make inflammation (the cause of blood) in your gums, so if you didn't do a good job of brushing or flossing the day prior, you could notice a little blood,\" says Cram. Slow your roll the next time you brush to hit all the sneaky spots bacteria hangs out, and the blood should stop.

They frame the emerald green colored dome of an ornate shrine erected to honor Mumtaz Qadri, an assassin hanged for gunning down a politician who criticized Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law and defended a Christian woman sentenced to death for allegedly insulting Islam.\n\nQadri's body lies in a marble-encased tomb inside the shrine. He had been a member of an elite police unit charged with protecting Punjab provincial governor Salman Taseer. Instead, he turned his AK-47 assault rifle on the politician killing him in a hail of bullets. With an eerie smile on his face he then laid down his weapon and was arrested, tried and later hanged.\n\nThe shrine, which is being built on the outskirts of the federal capital, is worrisome for those in Pakistan who fear a growing tide of extremism in the country marked by brutal sectarian killings, violent protests by clerics in favor of the blasphemy law, and frightening threats to anyone who would dare to challenge it.\n\nFive liberal-leaning bloggers who disappeared earlier this month, and the Pakistanis who are protesting their disappearance, have become the latest target of radical clerics and their followers. The clerics have accused the missing writers of blasphemy after a social media campaign linked them to allegations of blasphemy without any evidence. A simple accusation of blasphemy in Pakistan can be tantamount to a death sentence.\n\nThe government has tried to quell the allegations, saying there is no evidence that the bloggers said or did anything that could be considered blasphemous and no suggestion of any of them being charged with blasphemy once they are found.\n\nThe bloggers, whose disappearances have been decried nationally and internationally, have been critical of the military and have bemoaned the presence of radical religious militant groups in their country. No one has taken responsibility for their disappearances.\n\nSupporters of the bloggers say that Qadri's shrine exalts those who kill in the name of religion and makes even amending the blasphemy law to make it more difficult to abuse, a dangerous proposition.\n\n\"This is very, very unfortunate . . . that a person who has been adjudged by the highest constitutional court of Pakistan, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, as a terrorist (yet) these clerics and the innocent people of this country, they're trying to paint him as a saint,\"\" said attorney Saif-ul-Mulk. \"I can assure you that in the coming 10 to 20 years, he will be a saint of very high profile and billions of rupees will be coming to his shrine.\"\n\nMulk is defending Asiya Bibi, the Christian woman who has been on death row for the last six years, and has launched a final appeal on her behalf in the Supreme Court. Bibi was charged with blasphemy after a group of women with whom she worked in the field berated her for drinking the same water as them. They argued and the women accused Bibi of insulting Islam's prophet, a charge she flatly denies.\n\nMulk also prosecuted Qadri, securing a guilty verdict and death sentence that was carried out last year. He travels with security and police are stationed outside his home in the eastern Punjab city of Lahore.\n\nIn an interview, Mulk also warned that the financial windfall that has come with Qadri's death risks encouraging would-be \"martyrs.\"\n\n\"If one person is not able to feed his parents and family, he gives his life, kills somebody big and the whole family becomes richer than they could ever dream,\" he said.\n\nFor some in Pakistan, the shrine is seen as yet another tool in the arsenal of radical Sunni Muslim groups seeking to consolidate their hold over Pakistan's 180 million people.\n\nAyesha Siddiqa, a defense analyst who has written extensively on Pakistan's military complex, warned in a recent column that Qadri's shrine will emerge as a rallying cry for the preservation of the blasphemy law, which some liberal lawmakers would like to see at least amended to make it more difficult to abuse.\n\n\"The blasphemy law is their big ticket to support amongst the masses which they would like to consolidate further with the symbol they have now erected in the form of Mumtaz Qadri's shrine near the capital city,\" Siddiqa wrote. \"Last year, his family had buried him strategically in an open ground and sort of wilderness (area) to ensure that a structure could be built on top.\"\n\nQadri's brother, Amir Sajjad, speaking at the shrine where he spends every afternoon and evening collecting donations, said the shrine was his brother's final wish. Sajjad said Qadri told his family he wanted a shrine built at his grave as well as a mosque and a madrassah, or religious school.\n\nConstruction has already begun on the mosque and preparations are under way for the school. Millions of rupees in donations have been collected, said Sajjad.\n\nThe roof of the shrine shimmers from the thousands of tiny mirrors inlaid throughout. A crystal chandelier revolves atop Qadri's ornate marble grave embellished with verses from Islam's holy book, The Quran.\n\nDespite the construction, adherents lay their prayer mats and offer prayer. Those coming to pay homage to Qadri are a mix of men, women enveloped in large shawls, children and a handful of young students from Pakistan's financial hub Karachi, a cosmopolitan city of 20 million people on the Arabian Sea.\n\nThey are educated and speak English but their views are hardline.\n\nBilal Fazl, 18, who attends university in Karachi, was filled with admiration for Qadri.\n\n\"He said the blasphemy law was a black law. It was OK to kill him,\" he said of Taseer.\n\nFazl called Qadri a \"hero of Islam.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Kathy Gannon on Twitter at www.twitter.com/kathygannon .\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.88259124755859, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 906, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 9, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.35748823866, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 4, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170125080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.64238410596026, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/15/serbian-nationalist-train-causes-tension-as-it-reached-kosovo-border.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [87]}}, "headline": "Serbian nationalist train causes tension as it reaches Kosovo border", "wordcount_as_scraped": 567, "date": "20170115050000", "story_content": "BELGRADE, Serbia \u2013 \u00a0An elaborately decorated Serbian nationalist train took off Saturday from Belgrade aiming for northern Kosovo but halted at the border in a stunt that triggered a dramatic escalation of tensions between the former wartime foes.\n\nKosovo officials had protested earlier that the train was in violation of their country's sovereignty and promised not to let it in.\n\nSerbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic ordered the train stopped at the Serbian town of Raska as it approached the border with Serbia's former province, claiming that Kosovo's ethnic Albanians had tried to mine the railway.\n\nKosovo police strongly denounced such accusations but said they had had checked the railway and found no explosives.\n\nKosovo Prime Minister Isa Mustafa said he had contacted the United States and the European Union to express his country's concerns.\n\n\"I believe that turning back the train was the appropriate action and its entry into the independent and sovereign Republic of Kosovo would not be allowed,\" he said at a Saturday evening news conference.\n\nThe Russian-made train was painted with Serb flags, religious Christian Orthodox scenes, monasteries and medieval towns and inscribed with \"Kosovo is Serbian\" in 20 world languages. Hostesses on it wore the colors of the Serbian national flag.\n\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but Serbia does not recognize the split and has sought to maintain influence in Kosovo's north, where most of the country's Serb minority is located.\n\nAt an urgently called news conference in Belgrade on Saturday, Vucic accused the Kosovo government in Pristina of plans to arrest the train's driver and passengers.\n\n\"This was an ambition to provoke a conflict, to start a wider conflict in this territory that we consider as ours,\" Vucic said. \"It was my decision to stop the train in Raska to preserve the freedom and lives of our people, to prevent a wider conflict and show that we want peace.\"\n\nHe warned ethnic Albanians in Kosovo not to attack Kosovo's Serb minority \"because Serbia will not allow those attacks.\"\n\n\"We sent a train, not a tank,\" Vucic said.\n\nNATO-led troops are controlling Kosovo's borders following an intervention in 1999 to stop a bloody Serbian crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.\n\nSaturday's promotional ride was the first from Belgrade, the Serbian capital, to the northern Kosovo town of Mitrovica since the 1998-99 war. The train later turned back toward Belgrade.\n\nKosovo President Hashim Thaci said Saturday on his Facebook page that Kosovo respects the freedom of movement of people and goods but a train covered in nationalist banners that violate Kosovo's constitution and laws \"is completely unacceptable.\"\n\nHe also noted the train had some passengers and Serb officials who did not have permission to enter Kosovo.\n\n\"Anything that is illegal and threatens Kosovo's state sovereignty, must be prevented.

She has a track record of trying to overhaul troubled police agencies.\n\nChicago hired her six months ago to lead an effort to oversee police reforms. She was a finalist for chief after a video showing an officer fatally shooting a black teenager 16 times led to the superintendent's firing.\n\nSpeaking with a distinct southern drawl, Kirkpatrick vowed to rebuild damaged relations with Oakland's significant black community while working to revitalize a demoralized rank-and-file force.\n\n\"I'm interested in transformation,\" Kirkpatrick said.\n\nShe offered few specifics of her plans but said, \"I don't consider it a mess,\" when asked about taking over the embattled department. \"It's an opportunity.\"\n\nMaya Whitaker, a black community organizer who helped with the job search, said the new chief is aware that she is entering a \"no-trust zone\" and needs \"to break down barriers.\"\n\nWhitaker said she's optimistic that Kirkpatrick, who is white, has the experience to succeed in Oakland but the community \"will hold her accountable\" if she fails.\n\nSgt. Barry Donlan, head of the officers' union, said \"Oakland's hard-working police officers look forward to working collaboratively with Chief Kirkpatrick in serving our community.\"\n\nShe joins a rare slate of female leaders of a large city. Oakland's mayor, fire chief and city administrator are all women.\n\nKirkpatrick previously held high-ranking law enforcement posts in Washington state, including as Spokane's police chief for six years through 2012. The city hired her to reform a department rocked by a police brutality scandal. Along the way, she earned a law degree at Seattle University.\n\nKirkpatrick will bring her background in reform to an agency dogged by a scandal that ensnared two dozen officers throughout the San Francisco Bay Area accused of having sex with the teen daughter of an Oakland dispatcher.\n\nAbout a dozen Oakland officers resigned, were suspended or were implicated in the scandal, and seven current and former Bay Area officers faced criminal charges.\n\nThe teen has told The Associated Press and other media outlets that she worked as a 17-year-old prostitute and had sex with two dozen officers, sometimes in exchange for tips on prostitution stings and protection from arrest.\n\nThe allegations led to Oakland cycling through three police chiefs in June before the mayor announced that the city's administrator would take over management of the department until a permanent chief was hired.\n\nThe police force has been under federal court supervision since the 2003 settlement of a civil rights lawsuit that accused officers of planting evidence, beating suspects and other wrongdoing.\n\nUnder former Chief Sean Whent, the city was close to shedding court oversight when the sex scandal derailed the department's reform process and forced Whent to resign.\n\nBay Area Rapid Transit Deputy Chief Ben Fairow was appointed to replace Whent but resigned shortly afterward when news of an extramarital affair surfaced.\n\nOakland Deputy Chief Paul Figueroa agreed to act as interim chief but stepped down two days later for unknown reasons.

Lobbyists for the firearms industry, including the National Rifle Association, cite the CDC statistics to argue that such deaths are so rare that voluntary education - not additional laws or regulations - are needed.\n\nCDC officials have acknowledged that their statistics are low because they rely on how coroners classify the fatalities on death certificates. Some coroners rule deaths in which one child unintentionally shoots another as a homicide - rather than an accidental discharge - because they fit the definition of being killed by another. They also can classify them as undetermined if the intent is unclear - for example, if it's not certain whether a minor committed suicide or accidentally shot himself.\n\nAP and USA TODAY Network counted fatal shootings that were declared accidental or unintentional by investigating agencies. The media organizations' review did not include deaths where guns were fired on purpose, such as cases of stray bullets or celebratory gunfire.\n\nThe undercount for 2015 is in line with, but more significant than, the one observed for 2014, when the CDC missed one-third of the 113 deaths documented by the media outlets.\n\nThe CDC data, released Thursday, does track a trend identified in the media organizations' review in which deaths of all minors are most common among 3-year-olds, who typically pick up unsecured, loaded guns in their homes and fire back at themselves. The data also shows another spike in deaths among 15- to 17-year-olds, who are more likely to be shot by another teen playing with a gun.\n\nMark Rosenberg, former director of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said he believes the nation could eliminate all unintentional gun deaths involving children. He said \"it's crazy\" the government isn't doing more research into how to prevent them, in part because of a 1996 law that declared the CDC cannot use research funding to advocate or promote gun control.\n\n\"I think people 30 years from now are going to look back at this time and say, 'My God, how did we, as parents, as a nation, tolerate these deaths? These shooting deaths where a toddler kills a sibling or where a child is gunned down by a gun that they found in their home - how did we ever put up with that?'\" Rosenberg said. \"We use the word 'accident' and lull ourselves into this deadly complacency that says, 'This is just the cost of having firearms in our country'. It's not.\"\n\nRosenberg said accurate data is needed to persuade lawmakers and firearm owners to make changes, for instance to adopt smart gun technology that would only allow the owner to fire the weapon.\n\nThe NRA said Friday that its Eddie Eagle gun safety program, which tells students not to pick up any guns they see, has helped reduce the number of unintentional shootings in the last two decades but that more can be done.\n\n\"The NRA believes firearms education, safety, and training is the key to preventing accidental shootings,\" spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen said.\n\nCecily Wallman-Stokes, senior research manager for Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by Michael Bloomberg, said the problem of inadequate data about gun violence goes far beyond unintentional shootings. For example, she said the government can't say how many people are injured by guns or how many women are shot to death by their dating partners.\n\n\"Timely, reliable data have led to lifesaving advances in other public health issues like traffic safety, tobacco use, and lead exposure,\" she said. \"Gun violence deserves the same.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.87757921218872, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 674, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.5519397904799996, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161212130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9673590504451, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/04/obama-says-military-must-maintain-confidence-americans.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [73, 90, 96, 416, 422, 666, 1140, 1522, 1528, 1934, 2486, 2492, 2850, 2856, 3105, 3111]}}, "headline": "Obama calls for seamless transition for US military to Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 515, "date": "20170104220000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0President Barack\u00a0Obama\u00a0called for a smooth handover of control of the U.S. military to incoming commander in chief Donald Trump, as the outgoing president met Wednesday with military leaders for the last time.\n\n\"We've got to make sure that during this transition period that there is a seamless passing of the baton, that there's continuity,\"\u00a0Obama\u00a0said.

Over the last few days, Trump has disputed the U.S. intelligence community's assessments about Russian hacking, insisted without explanation that North Korea won't develop a nuclear weapon that could hit the U.S. and questioned the worth of the United Nations.\n\nObama\u00a0pointed to a handful of conflicts that Trump will inherit when he takes office on Jan. 20, including the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria and in the Iraqi city of Mosul, the biggest IS stronghold in Iraq and last major Iraqi city where the extremist group still has control. He also noted that the conflict in Afghanistan \"is still active.\"\n\nIn praising the military,\u00a0Obama\u00a0appeared to call attention to traditions that Democrats are most concerned that Trump may not uphold. Trump has nominated retired Marine Corps Gen.

He said there is \"no greater privilege and no greater honor\" than serving as commander in chief.\n\n\"As I reflect on the challenges we have faced together and on those to come, I believe that one of the greatest tasks before our armed forces is to retain the high confidence that the American people rightly place in you,\"\u00a0Obama\u00a0said. \"We must never hesitate to act when necessary to defend our nation, but we must also never rush into war because sending you into harm's way should be a last and not first resort.\"\n\nPrior to his remarks, Defense Secretary Ash Carter presented\u00a0Obama\u00a0with the Medal of Distinguished Public Service as a token of appreciation for his service as commander in chief.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.18148820102214802, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 509, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.62498218861, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.69744597249509, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/29/top-dems-turn-on-kerry-over-israel-speech.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3063, 4147, 4291]}}, "headline": "Top Dems turn on Kerry over Israel speech", "wordcount_as_scraped": 664, "date": "20161229180000", "story_content": "Secretary of State John Kerry is under fire for his blunt speech taking aim at the Israeli government -- with criticism coming from not only congressional Republicans, but also from members of his own party.\n\nThe defiant secretary of state used the speech Wednesday to defend the decision by the Obama administration to abstain on a U.N. Security Council resolution calling Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem a violation of international law. The abstention allowed the measure to pass Friday \u2013 enraging the Israelis and drawing a strong rebuke from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThat abstention was opposed by a number of Democratic lawmakers, including incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY., as well as Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Chris Coons, D-Del., Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla.\n\nIn his speech defending the abstention, Kerry rebuked what he called the \"settler agenda,\" which he claimed is hurting prospects for peace.\n\n\"Friends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect,\" Kerry said. He called the current government the \"most right-wing\" in Israel's history and claimed its agenda is \"driven by the most extreme elements.\"\n\nKerry's speech was instantly met with a fresh wave of criticism from Republicans, with President-elect Donald Trump tweeting: \"We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect.\"\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also took issue with the speech:\n\n\"Secretary Kerry's speech today was at best a pointless tirade in the waning days of an outgoing administration. At worst, it was another dangerous outburst that will further Israel's diplomatic isolation and embolden its enemies,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Kerry's words were also criticized by senior members of his own party, with Schumer accusing him of emboldening extremism.\n\n\"While Secretary Kerry mentioned Gaza in his speech, he seems to have forgotten the history of the settlements in Gaza, where the Israeli government forced settlers to withdraw from all settlements and the Palestinians responded by sending rockets into Israel,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"While he may not have intended it, I fear Secretary Kerry, in his speech and action at the [United Nations], has emboldened extremists on both sides.\"\n\nSome high-profile Democrats, such as House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., backed Kerry. Pelosi called Kerry's speech \"a reaffirmation of America's commitment to a secure, Jewish and democratic Israel, and a state for the Palestinians.\"\n\nBut Rep. Eliot Engel, D-NY., accused Kerry on beating up on Israel while laying off the Palestinians.\n\n\"The two state solution is the only way to get peace but what Secretary Kerry did was just beat up on Israel in a disproportionate way [and] sort of gloss over the terrorism that the Palestinians have used throughout these years,\" Engel, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Fox and Friends\u00a0Thursday.\n\nEngel also said he would be prepared to work with President-elect Trump on strengthening the U.S. relationship with Israel in the future.\n\n\"I think support for Israel in Congress is bipartisan and should remain bipartisan and if President Trump is working with us on Israel, I'm perfectly happy to work with the President of the United States,\" he said.\n\nOther Democrats made positive remarks about the speech, while also noting their continued opposition to the abstention. Sen. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., said he shared a number of Kerry's concerns, specifically on the lack of progress on a two-state solution, but said \"I remain disappointed by the Obama Administration's decision not to veto UN Security Resolution 2334 last week.\"\n\nHouse Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., also offered cautious support for Kerry's speech while reiterating his opposition to the absention.\n\n\"The United States will have a role to play in helping both parties reach the goal of lasting peace, even if that involves highlighting uncomfortable facts on the ground, as Secretary Kerry did.\u00a0 Nonetheless, I continue to believe that the U.N. Security Council is the wrong forum for critiquing Israeli policies,\" he said in a statement.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.20334267616272, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 635, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.60641294306, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 4, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.40944881889764, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/29/nypd-to-allow-sikh-officers-to-wear-turbans-and-beards-while-on-duty.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [336, 1015, 1020, 1364, 1370, 2178, 2185, 2297, 2389, 2396, 2713, 2719]}}, "headline": "NYPD to allow Sikh officers to wear turbans and beards while on duty", "wordcount_as_scraped": 601, "date": "20161229210000", "story_content": "In a gesture of goodwill to the city's burgeoning Sikh population, the New York City Police Department will soon allow officers who are members of the religion to wear blue turbans and beards while on duty.\n\nThe announcement was made by NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill\u00a0on Wednesday shortly after the police academy's graduation ceremony at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\"We're making this change to make sure that we allow everybody in New York City that wants to apply and have the opportunity to work for the greatest police department in the nation,\" O'Neill told the media as he was flanked by NYPD officers wearing blue turbans with badges on them.\n\nSikh officers will now be permitted to wear turbans in place of the traditional police cap and grow beards up to a half-inch long for religious reasons, provided that they first get approval from a commanding officer. The turbans also must be navy blue and have the NYPD insignia attached.\n\nBefore,\u00a0Sikh\u00a0officers had to fit their turbans under their department issued cap. Beards were forbidden because they interfered with wearing gas masks.\n\n\"I thought it was about time that we did that,\" O'Neill told DNA Info. \"Hopefully, with this change in policy, we're going to be able to get more people to apply.\"\n\nO'Neill added that there are about 160\u00a0Sikhs\u00a0serving in the police department.\n\nIf the NYPD officially enacts the policy, it will join a small group of law enforcement agencies that permit their ranks to wear a beard and turban, which includes police departments in Washington D.C. and Riverside, California as well as the United States Army. Since the 1990s, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have permitted beards and turbans and earlier this year allowed Muslim \"Mounties\" to wear a hijab.\n\nMembers of the Sikh Coalition \u2013 a group that aims to protect Sikh's religious freedoms in the U.S. \u2013 said that until a written policy is implemented it's difficult to weigh in on the merits of the change and the impact it will have on the community. The group did, however, say that O'Neill's words sent \"a powerful message\" to the rest of the country.\n\n\"The\u00a0NYPD's\u00a0refusal to hire turbaned and bearded Sikhs allows other employers to justify refusing to hire Sikhs,\" Harsimran\u00a0Kaur, the Sikh Coalition's Legal Director, said in a statement sent to FoxNews.com. \"If the\u00a0NYPD's\u00a0new policy indeed allows for Sikhs to maintain unshorn beards and turbans, that sends a powerful message to the rest of America that Sikhs are an important part of our nation's fabric.\"\n\nSikhism is a monotheistic religion that originated in the 15th century in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan. Male observant\u00a0Sikhs\u00a0often cover their heads with turbans \u2014 which are considered sacred \u2014 and refrain from shaving their beards.\n\nWhile the majority of the world's 30 million Sikhs live in India, the Sikh Coalition estimates that there are between 500,000 and 1 million members of the religious group living in the U.S., with the majority residing in the tri-state area around New York City.\n\n\"This has been a careful process that we've been working with the Sikh officers to try to make sure we get this done,\" O'Neill said of the NYPD's new policy. \"We want to make the NYPD as diverse as possible and I think this is going to go a long way to help us with that.\"\n\nThe NYPD will offer an entrance exam to the police academy in January \u2013 the first time the nation's largest police force has done so in about a year and a half.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.23626375198364, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 599, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.24228263639, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161229210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.3388981636060096, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/11/11/gopro-drone-recall-raises-oversight-questions.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a9": [4976], "\u00a0": [1169, 1259, 2092, 2630, 2738, 4273, 4290, 4765, 4963]}}, "headline": "GoPro Drone \"Recall\" Raises Oversight Questions", "wordcount_as_scraped": 836, "date": "20161111190000", "story_content": "When GoPro pulled all of its newly released Karma drones from the market on Tuesday and asked consumers to return already purchased units for a full refund, it was a first-of-its-kind event. But it wasn't technically a \"recall.\" (More on that in a moment.) And the episode raised a larger question of which government agency has responsibility for dealing with defective drones that fall from the sky.\n\n\nGoPro pulled the $800 machines from the market after discovering that \"a small number\" of the drones lost power during operation, and plummeted to earth. The drone, the first for the action-sports camera company, had been on the market only since October 23, and approximately 2,500 of the devices had been sold to consumers.\n\nGoPro reports that no injuries or property damage have been associated with Karma's in-flight failures.\n\nWhile the company has called the move a \"recall,\" that term can be confusing. For most products, a recall is a legal process in which a government agency has oversight authority and, along with other protections, it actually becomes illegal to continue to sell the devices under recall.\u00a0\n\nBut with drones, it's not clear which government body should be overseeing the process.\u00a0Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) spokesperson Scott Wolfson says simply, \"We do not have jurisdiction over drones.\"\n\nThe FAA, meanwhile, has strict authority over how drones are flown, both by commercial and non-commercial users, but the agency doesn't regulate the devices itself, except in the broadest terms. FAA spokesperson Alison Duquette explains that the agency does not \"certificate\" drones during the manufacturing process the way that it does larger aircraft.\n\n\"If a drone manufacturing defect that affects aviation safety were identified,\" she explains. \"The FAA would first contact the manufacturer to understand the issue and determine the best course of action to address the safety issue.\"\n\nThe lack of clear oversight left GoPro in a somewhat awkward position after it discovered the issues with the Karma.\u00a0\n\n'We contacted the CPSC,\" And we said 'It looks like there's a statutory carveout for aviation,'\" says GoPro spokesperson Jeff Brown. \"However, if you would like us to participate in the process we're more than happy to do that. They said 'No, you don't need to participate.'\"\n\nGoPro also contacted the FAA before going ahead with its voluntary Karma return program, Brown says. \"We called the FAA and they said 'We are not going to particpate in the process but we agree you should go ahead with your recall if that's what you think.'\"\u00a0\n\nRepresentatives of the CPSC and the FAA confirmed that GoPro had contacted them about the return program.\u00a0\n\nDespite this jurisdictional uncertainty, GoPro seems to be doing what companies should do\u2014taking measures to remove unsafe products from the market and protect consumers. The company is offering an incentive for affected consumers to return the devices, providing a free GoPro Hero5 Black camera, which has a street price of $350, in addition to a full refund on the drone.\n\nBut GoPro's issue with the Karma raises the question: If a similar failure was to affect a drone made by a company that was less responsive to consumer safety, would any government agency step in to try and get the products off the market?\n\nThat's why on June 6, Consumer's Union, the policy and mobilization arm of Consumer Reports, wrote a letter to the CPSC suggesting that drones were \"an emerging hazard.\" The letter added, \"The CPSC is the agency with the expertise to address potential product safety hazards and we urge it not to hesitate to get involved, even when another agency is wielding oversight of a product.\"\n\nIndeed, the regulatory confusion for GoPro should serve as a warning about the potential problems of dealing with a similar issue in the future.\n\n\"While we're glad the company is taking back its products and offering owners full refunds, we're concerned that defective drones seem to fall into a safety gap,\" says William Wallace, a policy analyst for Consumers Union. \"Congress should clarify which agency is in charge so that the agency can coordinate recalls and protect consumers from safety defects that could hurt them.\"\n\nIn\u00a0the GoPro return\u00a0program, the company is urging all users, including those who have not yet experienced any issue with their drones, to return the product with all its accessories to the company or the retailer where it was bought for a full refund. An original receipt is not needed to receive a refund.\n\nThe company is not issuing replacements for the defective drones at this point, although it did suggest that the Karma drone will return to the market once the safety issue is resolved.\u00a0\n\nThe GoPro Karma attempted to differentiate itself from other entrants in the fast-growing camera drone segment by featuring folding wings that allowed the Karma to be carried in a small backpack.\u00a0\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2005-2016 Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.

In return, Netanyahu has berated him, sued him and even reportedly tried to get him fired.\n\nBut Drucker has kept at it, and two of his recent stories have triggered police investigations.\n\nFirst, he broke the story that Netanyahu's personal attorney had represented a German company involved in a $1.5 billion sale of submarines to Israel, raising questions about the prime minister's possible involvement.\n\nThen, he reported that Australian billionaire James Packer has lavished Netanyahu's college-aged son, Yair, with gifts that included extended stays at luxury hotels in Tel Aviv, New York and Aspen, Colorado, the use of his private jet and dozens of tickets for concerts by Packer's former fiancee, Mariah Carey. Packer, who also owns a home next to Netanyahu in the prosperous coastal community of Caeserea, is reportedly seeking Israeli residency status for tax purposes.\n\nNetanyahu did not dispute any of the facts but insists he has done nothing wrong.

Like U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, he has taken to social media to lambast the press.\n\nNetanyahu encouraged the establishment in 2007 of Israel Hayom, a free daily financed by billionaire Sheldon Adelson that largely serves as his mouthpiece. He has appointed himself minister responsible for media regulation and ordered his coalition partners not to float any media-related bills without his approval.\n\nHe recently pushed to have the state-run Israel Broadcasting Authority shut down and replaced with a new corporation, only to reverse course once the emerging personnel of the new body did not seem favorable enough.\n\nNetanyahu has lashed out at several reporters. He took one newsman to court for reporting that Sara Netanyahu kicked her husband out of the car on a busy highway in a fit of rage. Last month, after acclaimed investigative TV journalist Ilana Dayan reported on mistreatment of the prime minister's staff, she read a 6-minute rebuke from Netanyahu on the air in which he called her a \"left-wing extremist\" and slammed her credentials.\n\nBut Netanyahu has reserved most of his criticism for Drucker, a 46-year-old journalist with a mop of messy black hair and an on-air penchant for pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. In the past two months, Netanyahu has mentioned him by name in at least a half-dozen disparaging Facebook posts.\n\n\"He has elevated me beyond what I deserve,\" Drucker said with a chuckle. \"I mean, it is such an overreaction even from his perspective.\"\n\nWhile in the army, Drucker was a military police investigator before earning a law degree and starting his journalism career as a real estate reporter at a newspaper. He later became a radio diplomatic reporter and a Nieman fellow at Harvard before moving to TV.\n\nDrucker has made his mark by steering clear of generic critical commentary in favor of investigations of money and power.\n\nHe's been an equal-opportunity muckraker, taking aim at all of Netanyahu's rivals as well. Prior to the 2006 election, he published the personal diaries of Omri Sharon \u2014 son of then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon \u2014 that detailed shady political dealings.\n\nAhead of the 2007 primaries of the centrist Labor Party, Drucker aired footage of fake balloting that led to a police investigation.\n\nHe wrote a book critical of Ehud Barak's truncated stint as prime minister and aired revelations that caused legal woes for former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Olmert once famously quipped, \"Everyone knows that Raviv Drucker is Bibi's court reporter\" \u2014 a reference to Netanyahu. Drucker proudly features the quote on his website.\n\nBut Netanyahu, who has been prime minister since 2009, has become Drucker's main target. In one of his most memorable scoops, Drucker detailed 10 years of the Netanyahu family's overseas travel expenses that included flights, hotels and meals paid for by rich associates. The report showed copies of receipts and a list of potential donors in Netanyahu's own handwriting, including Trump, a supporter of the prime minister.\n\nThe 2011 report led to a state comptroller's investigation and one of the three Netanyahu suits against him. Each time, Netanyahu eventually dropped the suits.\n\n\"I am an investigative journalist, and the moment someone rises to power what is my job if not to be that one who is looking to see if this person is honest and clean?\" he said. \"I infiltrated deep into his inner circle and into the most intimate things to him and that is something that really threatens him.\"\n\nIn 2011, when Channel 10 was on the verge of being shut because of crippling debts, the station said officials in Netanyahu's office hinted the government would ease up if Drucker was fired. Netanyahu denied it, but in last year's election campaign, he offered the station a rare interview as long as Drucker didn't do it. Channel 10 declined the offer.\n\n\"I think I have earned his bitterness and hatred honestly,\" Drucker said.\n\nOf late, perhaps inspired by Trump, Netanyahu appears to be particularly relishing the media warfare, depicting the press as an agent of the left.\n\n\"As we saw in the recent American election, the media's personal slander doesn't convince the public,\" he wrote in a Facebook post Wednesday.\n\nNetanyahu owes much of his political rise to his U.S.-style TV persona and reputation as a master communicator, said Yuval Karniel, a communications expert at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design.\n\n\"This is a man who understands the media and understands how to use it to his advantage. And attacking it is what works for him now,\" he said. \"The problem is that by making it personal, he is displaying complete contempt toward ethical journalism and undermining the role it plays in a liberal society.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Aron Heller on Twitter at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.6644463539123504, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1074, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 7, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.8225772175, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161203150000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.2346368715083798, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/07/pirates-preying-on-venezuelan-fishermen-as-industry-unravels.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [88, 733, 776, 991, 1008, 1365, 1780, 1781, 1782, 1783, 1784, 1785, 1786, 1787, 1788, 1789, 1790, 1791, 1792, 1793, 1794, 2385, 2386, 2387, 2388, 2389, 2390, 2391, 2392, 2393, 2394, 2395, 2396, 2397, 2398, 5539, 5966, 5972, 6566, 6961, 7157, 8036]}}, "headline": "Pirates preying on Venezuelan fishermen as industry unravels", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1422, "date": "20161208060000", "story_content": "PUNTA DE ARAYA, Venezuela \u2013 \u00a0The pirates had killed Flaco Marval's brother and two cousins, and word was they were coming for the rest of the family.\n\nSo the skinny 17-year-old and the other Marval men ran to grab the guns they'd soldered together from kitchen pipes, smoked an acrid-smelling drug to boost their energy, and went out into the night to patrol the sandy village streets. Flaco was flying high.\n\n\"We just have to kill these thugs, and then we can go back to fishing like we always did,\" he said.\n\nPirates are terrorizing the coastal state of Sucre, once home to the world's fourth-largest tuna fleet and a thriving fishing industry.\n\nThat trade has collapsed,\u00a0along with virtually every industry across\u00a0Venezuela. Gangs of out-of-work fishermen prey upon those who still venture out into the open sea, stealing their catch and motors, tying them up, throwing them overboard, and sometimes shooting them. The robberies\u00a0have taken place\u00a0daily this year, and dozens of fishermen have died.\n\n\"People can't make a living fishing anymore, so they're using their boats for the options that remain: smuggling gas, running drugs and piracy,\" said Jose Antonio Garcia, leader of the state's largest union.\n\nVenezuela's once booming oil economy is on its knees under socialist President Nicolas Maduro.\u00a0In the low-lying western ranching region, cattle are dying for lack of feed. The mineral-rich states to the east no longer produce metal. In the agricultural heartlands, farmers wait in food lines to buy the crops they once grew before fertilizer ran out. Across the petroleum belt, rigs and refineries are silent, and this month has seen the rise of gas lines in a country with the world's largest oil reserves.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I've never seen this kind of total implosion without there being a war to cause it,\" said Venezuelan economist Alejandro Grisanti, formerly with Barclays Capital.\n\nHere on the coast, the catch is down to less than a third of the 120,000 tons of tuna Venezuela produced in 2004. In June, Sucre was the epicenter of food riots that swept through the country. Punta de Araya families got through the summer by eating \"dog soup,\" a broth made from seawater and the small fish that are usually thrown back.\n\n\"Those little sardines saved all our lives,\" library administrator Efren Pares said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Desperate, Venezuelans are stealing what remains from fatter times, robbing fishing boats of their nets, power generators and outboard motors. The warm Caribbean sea is increasingly becoming a grim free-for-all.\n\nSeven members of the Marval clan were preparing to return home one night in September when they heard shots.\n\n\"There's no way to run when you're stopped dead in the water, so I just started praying, 'God, let them leave without hurting us,'\" 42-year-old Edecio Marval said.\n\nInstead, after stealing the boat's motor and the night's catch, the men shot dead Edecio's oldest child, who had kept the group laughing all night with cheesy jokes, and two others.\n\nAs they prepared to kill Edecio's teenage nephew, one pirate shouted for the others to stop. \"No, that's my friend,\" he said. They had fished together until last year.\n\nSo the group sped off, leaving the surviving Marvals to send flashes of light into the darkness. They wept as the bodies of their loved ones grew cold beside them.\n\nBack home in the village of Punta de Araya, they told police they had recognized the pirates' leader: It was El Beta, a 19-year-old killer with 40 men at his command who lived a half mile down the road.\n\nEl Beta began calling Flaco Marval, threatening to come back and wipe out the whole clan.\n\n\"Your brother cried like a little bitch when I killed him. Now I'm coming for all of you snitches,\" he said in a taunting voice message the family turned over to police.\n\nThe Marvals hunkered down. Along with their neighbors, they gave up going to the state-run hospital up the hill because that area was controlled by El Beta. They stopped sending their kids to school. And they started nightly patrols.\n\n\"It's not safe to leave the house,\" said Tibisay Marval, whose son was killed.\n\nOne of Venezuela's poorest states, Sucre had been a bastion of support for the socialist revolution launched by the late President Hugo Chavez. That support is waning since the government nationalized the region's largest fishing company, Pescalba, in 2010, with mostly disastrous results. On a recent workday, more than half of the company's fleet bobbed uselessly at the dock, holes gaping where the ships' decks and sides had rusted open.\n\nThe main port is so quiet, it looks like workers are on strike. Many private companies have decamped to other countries because the government requires them to sell half of their catch for Venezuela's virtually worthless currency, the bolivar.\n\n\"We fishermen know the meaning of labor, but we can't work if we have nothing to work with,\" said 57-year-old Fernando Patino.\n\nIn October, pirates left Patino and his brother bound with twine in their small motorized skiff, miles from shore. Patino managed to wriggle loose, and the men spent seven hours rowing home with a plank of wood torn from the boat's side.\n\nOn the night they prepared to face down El Beta, Flaco spotted a soldier darting beneath a streetlight with a Kalashnikov rifle. Soon, the streets were filled with villagers hoping the coast guard had caught a group of pirates.\n\n\"Let's see if someone gets killed!\" a neighbor shouted.\n\nAs the throng\u00a0pushed in, soldiers loaded three men onto a cargo truck. But the villagers started to protest that they had the wrong guys; they knew the suspects to be honest fishermen. The soldiers let the men go.\n\nWomen began crowding around a lieutenant. Why hadn't he helped get their motors back? When was he going to take a stand against El Beta?\n\nThe lieutenant urged patience. But later he confessed that he too wanted to see El Beta\u00a0dead.\u00a0\n\nFive officers have been charged with storming a nearby village and killing nine members of a fishing family widely thought to have belonged to a gang. State security forces also killed three suspected pirates at sea this year, and arrested one of El Beta's men for the Marval murders. But officers are reluctant to make mass arrests because the jails are already packed full, with prisoners sleeping in shifts at night.\n\n\"You hear piracy and you think of guys robbing container ships in Africa. But here it's just poor fishermen robbing other poor fishermen,\" said Sucre lawyer Luis Morales.\u00a0\"It's the same kind of crime we've seen in the streets, but spreading to the sea. Tomorrow, it will be taking over life on the farms or in the mountains.\"\n\nShortly after the soldiers left Punta de Araya, the Marval women started getting warnings from friends in El Beta's neighborhood that 15 members of his gang were preparing to attack.\n\nThe women debated whether to call back the coast guard\u00a0and risk being labeled rats. Just as they decided to make the call, the village's power and cell service went out, as if cut by a hostile force. Panicked, they went to alert Flaco and the others.\u00a0\n\nThe cousins rushed to their armory of homemade handguns and rifles, hidden in a cinderblock hut with a sheet hung for a door.\n\nLaughing at each other's coughing fits, they smoked cocaine-laced marijuana through a long glass pipe they'd fashioned out of a fluorescent light bulb. They tried to psych themselves up for battle by listening again to El Beta's threatening message, crowding around a half-broken flip phone.\n\n\"Remember how we used to take naps on the beach with money in our pockets?\" one cousin said.\n\n\"This isn't going to be over until someone kills that guy,\" said another.\n\nSuddenly, the dogs began to bark. The young men shot out to the street to see if the gang was on its way. They kept up their patrol for hours, pausing every once in a while to smoke from the glass pipe.\n\nEventually, the barking died down. The power came back on. El Beta did not show up.\u00a0\n\nThe Marval women stayed awake until dawn, playing dominos near a shrine to the three slain men. Flaco's aunt Petra Marval said they worry about the cousins, but see no other option.\n\n\"Flaco could be killed here in the streets,\" she said. \"But he could be killed out at sea, too.\"\n\n___\n\nHannah Dreier is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/hannahdreier .

", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1628, "date": "20161216110000", "story_content": "One of the most infamous weapons in science-fiction movie history is the Death Star, a moon-size planet destroyer from the \"Star Wars\" universe. In the upcoming movie \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" a band of renegades tries to steal the plans for the Death Star from the evil Empire, in order to ultimately destroy the spherical death machine.\n\nDoes the Death Star lie completely in the realm of fiction, or could such a thing ever be constructed in real life? In 2012, more than 25,000 people signed a petition asking the U.S. government to construct its own Death Star. The White House (as it is bound to do when petitions receive a certain number of signatures) considered the application and penned a discouraging but tongue-in-cheek response \u2014 among the concerns cited in the rejection letter were the cost of such a project, and the fact that a single, small spacecraft was apparently enough to destroy it (a significant flaw for such a massive project).\n\nBut it turns out that the biggest obstacles aren't just money or rebel spacecraft, but physics. Here are some opinions from experts Space.com consulted on why it would or would not be possible to build a real Death Star. [Rogue One: A Star Wars Story in Picture]\n\nRod Pyle, author of the book \" Blueprint for a Battlestar: Serious Scientific Explanations Behind Sci-Fi's Greatest Inventions \" (Sterling, 2016)\n\nIf constructing the International Space Station was hard, the Death Star's complications dwarf that. Pyle says estimates indicate it would take 830,000 years of Earth's current steel output to create enough metal for the hull of the superstructure alone.\n\nRocket launches to send all that metal and other building materials to space would \"pollute the atmosphere to the point that anyone left who could use the Death Star would have to live on it \u2014 Earth would be uninhabitable,\" Pyle said.\n\nThe cost is also difficult to bear: $850 quadrillion, according to the White House's response to the online petition, which is many times the U.S. national debt of about $20 trillion.\n\n\"The best way to build a Death Star would likely be to mine asteroids and possibly the moon for metals, print the massive parts, and then transport them to the neighborhood of the Earth or whatever planet you want to destroy,\" he said.\n\nBut even then, there are problems, he added. The Death Star is at most 100 miles in diameter, and would not be able to survive long in low Earth orbit. Although small objects can remain in low orbit around the Earth for hundreds of years with no propulsion, an object that large would fall out of orbit more quickly and crash into the surface. Putting it into a higher orbit is possible but would require a \"prohibitive\" amount of rocket fuel, Pyle said.\n\nIn \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\" the Death Star's lasers are used to blow up the planet Alderaan, which is similar in size to Earth. But even the most advanced current military lasers would have trouble changing the flight path of an intercontinental ballistic missile as it careened towards Earth, he said. \"Of course, in 'Star Wars,' they used 'hypermatter' to power the Death Star,\" he added, \"so who knows what might be possible with this new and improved source of destructive power?\"\n\nRaychelle Burks, assistant chemistry professor at St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas\n\nIn 2015, the American Chemical Society released a video about the Death Star's laser , featuring Burks. In the video, Burks (who wasn't available for an interview before this article's deadline) explains that the most powerful laser beam on Earth is a 2-petawatt (2 quadrillion watts) beam constructed in Japan. The Death Star would require roughly a million billion times more power to blow up a planet, she said in the video.\n\n\"In producing all that energy, you would produce a lot of heat \u2014 like enough heat to melt the Death Star,\" Burks said.\n\nIf that's not discouraging enough, Burks pointed to the famous \"Star Wars\" scenes where several lasers from the Death Star all converge into a point, somehow combine and amplify, and then strike a doomed planet with a single beam.\n\n\"Light doesn't do that,\" she said. \"The individual beams would just pass by each other and keep going in their own directions.\" [Endor's End: How the 'Star Wars' Death Star Wiped Out the Ewoks After All]\n\nBrooks Peck, curator at the EMP Museum in Seattle\n\nAlthough generating enough metal to build a Death Star would be \"bonkers,\" technically speaking, it would be possible, Peck said. But there would need to be a huge space industry infrastructure to support it, including the ability to launch many more rockets than we can today, and asteroid mining.\n\nAnother consideration regarding the massive construction project is that the builders of the Death Star would be exposed to harmful ionizing radiation from space because they would be outside Earth's protective atmosphere and magnetic field, Peck said. He thinks the Empire would take two approaches to solving the problem: either shield the builders inside rock and water masses, or just let the workers die young of cancer. \"This is a Death Star, after all. It's got a reputation to maintain,\" he joked.\n\nBecause a superlaser would not work as a means to destroy planets, Peck suggested using a \"bullet of sufficient mass\" to blow up planets. The science-fiction term for such an object is a \"relativistic kinetic kill vehicle,\" which Peck admitted does not have the same snappy ring as \"Death Star.\" But as ugly as the name sounds, the concept would work: A large enough object moving at even a fraction of the speed of light could blow up the planet once it collided. Still, Peck said it would be best for an advanced civilization to focus its energy on other things.\n\n\"I hope, strongly, that a civilization that can command the resources and energy needed to create something like a Death Star would be smart enough and wise enough to turn its attention to more beneficial causes,\" he said. \"Imagine what else we could achieve through an effort on that scale. We could create a utopia for everyone.\"\n\nBrian Muirhead, chief engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nMuirhead is an experienced space engineer who was responsible for designing, developing, testing and launching the Mars Pathfinder rover that successfully landed on Mars on July 4, 1997. He also held senior positions for the Deep Impact Mission (which successfully crashed into a comet) and the Mars Curiosity mission (which landed on Mars in 2012 and is still going) during their development.\n\nToday, he is working on the Asteroid Redirect Mission, an initiative that will attempt to bring as much as 20 tons of a carbonaceous asteroid to the moon's orbit, for astronauts to explore.\n\nAsteroids would be a helpful resource in the construction of a Death Star, Muirhead added. A Death Star would require raw materials, and asteroids could provide that . Using asteroids as a source of raw materials would also reduce the need to launch rockets from Earth, he said. Even the manufacturing facilities on the asteroid could be at least partially created via in-space 3D printing (a technology that is used today on the International Space Station, he added).\n\n\"Given launch costs today, I did a simple calculation ... and the cost savings might be of the order of the total economic output of today's Earth for around a billion years (a huge and not very realistic number),\" he said. \"The alternative is to build huge factories at large asteroids (like Ceres, which is about 950 km [590 miles] in diameter) and use its materials and save the launch costs.\"\n\nMuirhead added that the laser on the Death Star is a technical problem, as it would likely require an output many times that of our sun, \"an extraordinary amount of energy,\" he said.\n\nStill, he can't wait to see the new \"Star Wars\" movie.\n\n\"As a spacecraft designer, I'm very much looking forward to 'Rogue One' and maybe getting a look at those plans,\" he said.\n\nPhilip Lubin, physics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara\n\nVarious experts who were consulted for this story told Space.com that there are some real-world aerospace technologies that are similar to those used in the Death Star, including nuclear weapons and chemical lasers.\n\nOne of those technologies is the DE-STAR (Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and Exploration) concept, which could be used to stop incoming asteroids and comets coming toward Earth and threatening our planet. Lubin is one of the scientists currently working on DE-STAR.\n\nThe concept (which is very much on the drawing board) would take the sun's energy and convert it into a phased array of laser beams to target incoming objects and vaporize them, or alter their orbit to get them away from Earth and possibly throw them into the sun.\n\nThere are different proposed sizes of DE-STAR. A 330-foot version could alter comet or asteroid orbits, while a 6-mile version would have enough energy to blow up a 1,600-foot asteroid once a year, Lubin said.\n\n(Lubin's group has also proposed a way to do fast interstellar travel using directed lasers. That concept, called DEEP-IN (Directed Energy for Relativistic Interstellar Missions), has Phase 2 funding from the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts Program that funds far-out concepts.)\n\nBut don't worry about planetary security. \"We have no current plans to vaporize planets,\" Lubin said, joking that he thought about it and concluded it is not a fundable idea. \"The system we are working on can be used for planetary defense against asteroids and comets ... It works quite well for that as well as for relativistic propulsion, if we can master the required technology.\"\n\n\u00a0Original article on Space.com .\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.746268630027771, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1496, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.3599488386500003, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.6711229946524098, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/06/democrats-activists-warn-trump-not-to-use-young-immigrants-data-for-deportation.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1161, 5098, 7808]}}, "headline": "Democrats, activists warn Trump not to use young immigrants' data for deportation", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1239, "date": "20170110000000", "story_content": "Democratic lawmakers, immigration activists and Obama administration officials are demanding that personal information that more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants provided to the U.S. government when they applied for a special program that spared them from deportation not be used against them in the future.\n\nSupporters of the immigrants, who are part of a program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, say the Obama administration succeeded in persuading those who applied for it to come out of the shadows by reassuring them that doing so would not backfire and get them deported.\n\nThey plan to call for a hands-off approach to DACA recipients \u2013 who were brought to the U.S. illegally as minors \u2013 at a rally in Washington D.C., as well as about a dozen cities nationwide \u2013 on Jan. 14. Some Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Luis Gutierrez, of Illinois, plan to speak at the rally.\n\n\"There are two competing philosophies here,\" Gutierrez, one of the most vocal supporters of undocumented immigrants in Congress, said to FoxNews.com in a statement. \u00a0\"One that says the immigrants are here and will probably be here for the rest of their lives, so we want them to be on the books, working with permission.\"\n\n\"The other philosophy is to make people scared to come forward even when they are complying with the law,\" he said. \"It could have a chilling effect in the future, so there should be a firewall between information submitted for one situation being used in a completely different context.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson joined the fray by insisting that the data the DACA recipients provided when they applied for the program, which President Barack Obama established in 2012 through an executive order, not be used for immigration enforcement.\n\nJohnson's warning came as Reuters reported that the Trump transition team sought information from the Homeland Security Department about Obama's executive actions on immigration. Reuters noted that Trump has made specific reference to DACA as one of several executive orders he plans to eliminate.\n\nProponents of stricter immigration enforcement say that Obama never should have issued the executive order giving what they view as amnesty to a mass group of people. And so, they argue, demands that the information not be used to enforce immigration laws are preposterous.\n\nRep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican who favors a hard line on immigration and has been a long-time member of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, wants the Trump administration to get rid of DACA, and views it absurd for federal agents not to be able to use information at their disposal to enforce the law.\n\n\"DACA is flat-out unconstitutional,\" King said to FoxNews.com \"You can't have a president announce that a huge class of people are exempt from the application of the law.\"\n\nImmigrants here legally who were brought to the country as children have been at the center of some of the most emotional debates about illegal immigration.\n\nTheir supporters say they are here illegally through no fault of their own, and that they should not be punished for decisions that their parents made. Some Republicans, including those who favor strict immigration laws, say they sympathize with that argument.\n\n\"Secretary Johnson's commitment to protecting [young immigrants] from deportation is admirable, as is the work done by DHS and this administration to protect and support immigrants,\" said Rep. Judy Chu in a statement. \"However...our concerns are with the actions of the incoming president who has expressly run against norms and precedent.\"\n\nChu and several other Democrats want Obama to issue an executive order precluding the use of the DACA recipients' information for deportation matters.\n\n\"Without such a legal assurance,\" she said, \"immigrants who believed our promise of security are left to the devices of President-elect Trump who has repeatedly promised to be a deporter-in-chief.\"\n\nTrump has at times expressed sympathy for immigrants brought here as children, indicating there should be some humane way to address their situation.\n\nSome Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio, of Florida, has said that the least politically explosive way to do away with DACA may be to phase it out, with the hope that Congress can develop more permanent solutions to fixing the immigration system through legislation.\n\nBut others say that to give these immigrants a break amounts to rewarding their parents' violation of U.S. laws, and sends the wrong message. In some cases, immigrants who have come forward to apply for legal status \u2013 such as through political asylum -- or another benefit have been subjected to deportation if their petition is declined or expires.\n\nIn other cases, certain U.S. agencies, such as those that collect complaints about wage and hour violations, and the Census Bureau, do not share information provided by undocumented immigrants with immigration authorities. \u00a0In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he would purge information about undocumented immigrants from government databases it were to be used for enforcement, but some experts have said such a move would be illegal.\n\n\"Everything I do on the issue of immigration comes back to restoring the rule of law,\" King said, adding that he thinks that DACA recipients and others who came illegally as minors should be subject to deportation.\n\n\"It's egregiously offensive to the integrity of the American people to give them a path that they legally didn't have a right to have,\" King said.\n\nMany DACA recipients, who had to meet strict criteria to qualify for the program, say they are worried they will be penalized for heeding the Obama administration's call to come forward.\n\nThey say they feel a greater bond to the United States than to their parents' homeland, one that many don't remember\n\n\"I've been in the United States so long, everything big that has happened to me in my life happened to me here,\" said Monica Camacho, a 22-year-old Maryland resident who came to the United States at the age of 7 from Mexico. \"We are in the [U.S. government] system. Are we going to be deported? Will our parents be deported?\"\n\n\"This is my home,\" she said of the United States. \"I want to be an elementary school teacher here. We want to contribute to the economy. We are not bad people, we love this country.\"\n\nMany critics of Obama's immigration executive action say that even if the Trump administration were to obtain the information of DACA recipients, it is unlikely to move to deport them any time soon.\n\nTrump has said his priority would be to track down and deport dangerous criminals and national security threats.\n\n\"They're going to have their hands full trying to restructure immigration enforcement,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors strict enforcement. \"Illegal aliens are all over the place, [immigration agents] don't need to go after DACA recipients\" specifically to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nKrikorian said that major immigration matters, such as border security, and chain family migration, must be fixed before hardliners in Congress would consider a measure giving special consideration to a path for legal status for immigrants who came as children.\n\n\"For people who came here and spent their entire schooling here, then sure,\" Krikorian said of some kind of amnesty for them, \"but cleaning up that mess that Obama created has to be in exchange for something.\"\n\n\n\nElizabeth Llorente is Senior Reporter for FoxNews.com, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnews.com.

That remains far lower than the numbers seen in the early 2000s.\n\nCHRISTIAN SCHOOL GOES TO COURT TO DEFEND A 30-SECOND PREGAME PRAYER\n\n\nThe most recent reporting covers calendar year 2015, which included the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., as well as Republican Donald Trump's call for a ban on all Muslims entering the U.S. All of those, however, did not occur until the final two months of the year.\n\n\nIt's not yet known whether Trump plans to implement such a ban now that he has won the presidency. Critics say his pledge has contributed to anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\n\n\"We've seen how words from public figures like Donald Trump translate into violence,\" said Mark Potok with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups in the U.S.\n\nTUMULT TO TRANQUILITY: REFUGEE FAMILY FINDS PEACE IN GERMANY\n\n\nLast year, there were 257 reported incidents of anti-Muslim bias compared to 154 the year before, a 67 percent increase. The number of reported hate crimes against Muslims peaked at 481 in 2001.\n\n\nIbrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said he was not surprised to see the large increase in 2015 and said he expects the trend to continue.\n\n\n\"We saw a spike in anti-Muslim incidents nationwide beginning toward the end of 2015. That spike has continued until today and even accelerated after the election of President-elect Trump,\" Hooper said.\n\n\nAccording to the FBI report, the majority of hate crimes were motivated by bias against race or ethnicity. Of the 4,216 victims of a hate crime motivated by race or ethnicity, 52 percent were black, 18.7 percent were white and 9.3 percent were Hispanic or Latino. Crimes against Jews increased about 9 percent, while bias incidents involving sexual orientation were up 3.5 percent.\n\n\nCivil rights groups have expressed concern that a Trump administration could radically reshape the U.S. Department of Justice, particularly when it comes to policing but also in terms of the priority placed on hate crimes. Those concerns were compounded over the weekend after Trump named as his chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, who came to his campaign from Breitbart News. Under his leadership, the Breitbart website became one of the leading outlets of the so-called alt-right, a movement often associated with far-right efforts to preserve \"white identity\" and oppose multiculturalism.\n\n\nMichael Lieberman with the Anti-Defamation League said there have been \"unprecedented efforts\" to address hate crimes in recent years, from outreach to law enforcement, community meetings and an emphasis on cooperation among federal agencies.\n\n\nAny increases, including the ones seen in anti-Muslim crimes, could be due in part to more reporting by victims as well as better reporting and tracking by law enforcement agencies. The number of law enforcement agencies sending data on hate crimes to the FBI decreased by about 3 percent in 2015.\n\n\nAn AP investigation earlier this year found 17 percent of local law enforcement agencies had not submitted a single hate crime report during the past six years as part of the FBI's tracking program, prompting concerns that an undercount was masking the true scope of hate and bias crimes in the U.S.\n\n\n\"Gaps in participation and incomplete reporting demonstrate materially that this work must continue, and we will be pressing the Trump Justice Department and U.S. attorneys so this important work will be ongoing,\" Lieberman said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.07453441619873, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 579, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.45959077427, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161115020000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 4, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.49050086355786, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/18/iraq-military-troops-have-full-control-eastern-mosul0.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [68]}}, "headline": "Iraq military: Troops have 'full control' of eastern Mosul", "wordcount_as_scraped": 541, "date": "20170118150000", "story_content": "BAGHDAD \u2013 \u00a0U.S.-backed Iraqi government troops announced on Wednesday they were in \"full control\" of eastern Mosul, after routing Islamic State militants from that part of the northern city almost exactly three months since the major operation started.\n\nThe achievement was a \"big victory,\" said Iraqi Army Lt. Gen. Talib Shaghati, who commands the counter-terrorism forces, describing the success of the Iraqi forces as \"unprecedented.\"\n\nShaghatai, who spoke to reporters in the town of Bartella, just east of Mosul, said plans were now being drawn up to retake the western part of the city. He did not elaborate on when that part of the operation would begin.\n\nWednesday's advance came after Iraqi troops over the past days intensified their push into the last IS-held neighborhoods in Mosul's eastern sector, closing in on the Tigris River, which roughly divides the city. Stiff resistance by the militants, thousands of civilians being trapped in their houses by the fighting and bad weather had in the past slowed the advances of the troops.\n\nHowever, skirmishes and clashes continued in some pockets along the Tigris in eastern Mosul, according to Iraqi special forces Maj. Ali Hussein who said his unit was still pushing into the Ghabat area along the river bank. Small arms fire could be heard and at least one civilian was wounded by mortar fire.\n\nAlso, some commanders on the ground disputed Shaghati's claim of \"full control\" of eastern Mosul, with Lt. Gen. Abdul-Amir Raheed Yar Allah saying the eastern side \"has not been fully liberated ... and the advance is still continuing.\"\n\nYar Allah, who commands army operations in Ninevah, where Mosul is the provincial capital, said the special forces \"have done their duty\" in eastern Mosul.\n\nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi issued a statement, posted on his website, saying that \"work is underway to liberate\" Ghabat and the area housing Saddam Hussein's former presidential palaces in eastern Mosul. He also vowed to liberate the western side of the city.\n\nBut the prospect of retaking western Mosul looms heavy on Iraqi forces, despite all the support they have by the U.S.-led coalition, as well as Sunni and Shiite volunteer militias. The western half of the city is home to some of Mosul's oldest neighborhoods, with narrow streets packed with buildings that will further complicate the urban fight.\n\nSo far in the Mosul offensive, Iraq's counterterrorism forces, which are by far the military's most battle seasoned unit, have done most of the fighting, advancing from east of the city.\n\nRegular Iraqi army troops are pushing from the city's southeast and northern edges, and the federal security forces from farther to the west.\n\nMosul \u2014 Iraq's second-largest city and the Islamic State group's last urban stronghold in the country \u2014 fell to IS in the summer of 2014, when the militant group captures large swaths of northern and western Iraq.\n\nThe operation has also left more than 148,000 people homeless, according to the United Nations. Nearly 12,500 people have been forced to flee their homes just over the past week, the U.N. said.\n\nMore than 1 million people were estimated to still be living in Mosul in October, when Iraqi forces launched the operation to retake the city.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Susannah George in Mosul, Iraq, contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.51770663261414, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 529, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.7200807207700002, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8355387523629503, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/25/trump-talk-keeping-iraq-oil-sparking-concerns.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [65]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 747, "scraper_regex": 788}}, "headline": "Trump's talk of keeping Iraq's oil sparking concerns", "wordcount_as_scraped": 788, "date": "20170125090000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0No one knows how seriously to take President Donald Trump's threat to seize Iraq's oil.\n\nDoing so would involve extraordinary costs and risk confrontation with America's best ground partner against the Islamic State group, but the president told the CIA this weekend, \"Maybe you'll have another chance.\"\n\nThe recycled campaign comment is raising concerns about Trump's understanding of the delicate Middle East politics involved in the U.S.-led effort against extremist groups. Trump has said he was opposed to the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein's dictatorship. But on the campaign trail and again on Saturday, the day after his inauguration, he suggested the costly and deadly occupation of the country might have been offset somewhat if the United States had taken the country's rich petroleum reserves.\n\n\"To the victor belong the spoils,\" Trump told members of the intelligence community, saying he first argued this case for \"economic reasons.\" He said it made sense as a counterterrorism approach to defeating the IS group \"because that's where they made their money in the first place.\"\n\n\"So we should have kept the oil,\" he said. \"But, OK, maybe you'll have another chance.\"\n\nThe statement ignores the precedent of hundreds of years of American history and presidents who have tended to pour money and aid back into countries the United States has fought in major wars. The U.S. still has troops in Germany and Japan, with the permission of those nations, but did not take possession of their natural resources. And taking Iraq's reserves, the world's fifth largest, would require an immense investment of resources and manpower in a country that the United States couldn't quell after spending more than $2 trillion and deploying at one point more than 170,000 troops.\n\nU.S. enemies and friends would oppose the move. While Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has accepted U.S. help to retake IS-held territory in his country, he has repeatedly asserted Iraqi sovereignty. He said of Trump's oil vow in November, \"I am going to judge him by what he does later.\"\n\nAsked about the matter Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer stressed Trump's economic argument.\n\n\"We want to be sure our interests are protected,\" he told reporters. \"We're going into a country for a cause. He wants to be sure America is getting something out of it for the commitment and sacrifice it is making.\"\n\nThere is uncertainty as to where Trump's idea derives from, though the president has noted that taking the oil is something \"I have long said.\" Hints of this notion existed in some of the pre-2003 rhetoric from the Bush administration about the Iraq war \"paying for itself.\" But top advisers to President George W. Bush have stressed how the future of Iraq's resources were pointedly left out of decision-making related to the invasion so as not to fuel a perception that the war was driven by oil concerns.\n\nBush \"almost bent over backwards not to make a special effort to gain access for us to the oil resources,\" John Negroponte, who was Bush's director of national intelligence, told CNN.\n\nRegarding Trump, former CIA Director and Defense Secretary Robert Gates told NBC, \"I have no clue what he's talking about.\"\n\nTaking the oil would require a permanent U.S. occupation, or at least until Iraq's 140 billion barrels of crude run out, and a large presence of American soldiers to guard sometimes isolated oil fields and infrastructure. Such a mission would be highly unpopular with Iraqis, whose hearts and minds the U.S. is still try to win to defeat groups such as IS and al-Qaida.\n\n\"This is totally wrong,\" said Zaher Aziz, a 42-year-old owner of a market stand in Irbil. \"They came here by themselves and occupied Iraq. And now they want the Iraqis to pay for that?\"\n\nHowever unrealistic Trump's suggestion, intelligence officials believe more has to be done to cut off Islamic State oil revenues. The group seized significant oil when it stormed across Syria's border in 2014 and seized the city of Mosul and large swaths of Iraqi territory. The U.S. Treasury Department estimated that IS raked in $500 million from oil and gas sales in 2015. That figure is likely lower now as a result of U.S.-led operations, but officials say oil continues to fund the group's recruitment and far-flung terrorist activities.\n\n\"In terms of oil helping establish ISIS, of course that's oversimplification,\" said Hassan Hassan, co-author of the book \"ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror,\" using an alternate acronym from the militants. He said oil was a small part of the group's \"origins and early years,\" when it morphed from an al-Qaida branch to an organization claiming a worldwide caliphate.\n\n___\n\nAP videojournalist Balint Szlanko in Irbil, Iraq, contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.96270394325256, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 747, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.3153786416, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8112449799196804, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/12/protesters-vow-fight-to-keep-trump-out-office.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 750, "scraper_regex": 796}}, "headline": "Protesters vow 'fight' to keep Trump out of office", "wordcount_as_scraped": 796, "date": "20161113030000", "story_content": "Thousands took to the streets Saturday across the United States as demonstrations against President-elect Donald Trump, with many suggesting they would prolong the fight as much as possible to keep him out of office.\n\nIn Los Angeles, several thousand people marched through downtown streets Saturday to condemn what they saw as Trump's hate speech about Muslims, pledge to deport people in the country illegally and crude comments about women.\n\nMASSIVE ANTI-TRUMP PROTESTS PLANNED FOR INAUGURATION DAY, POLICE ON ALERT\n\nJennifer Cruz, 18, of Ventura, California, carried a sign that asked: \"Legalize weed but not my Mom?\" -- a reference to Californians' Tuesday passage of a measure legalizing recreational marijuana use.\n\nCruz said her parents have been in the United States illegally for 30 years, although her mother has spent years seeking citizenship.

(For some perspective, that's about 0.0004 percent of the U.S. adult population.) Women are at higher risk of contracting the disease than men, and it most commonly affects people under 40. The causes of transverse myelitis aren't fully understood, according to Roumen Balabanov, M.D., neurologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. But David Rabinovici, M.D., neurologist at NY Neurology Associates, tells SELF that sometimes the condition is linked to infections like syphilis, lyme disease, and measles. Other times, it appears without warning. Symptoms\u2014neck or back pain, weakness, tingling or numbness, and bladder or bowel disfunction\u2014can present themselves in a matter of hours or over the course of several weeks. In Finchman's case, the symptoms presented rapidly, only taking one day to escalate to paralysis.\n\n\"When I realized I could no longer feel my legs I was horrified,\" Finchman told Metro. \"It was like I had become paralyzed overnight\u2014my whole life had been turned upside down in a matter of hours.\"\n\nThough Finchman's story is terrifying, experts say transverse myelitis is rare. \"People shouldn't get too panicky about this,\" Rabinovici says. Neck pain happens, and most of the time it's not indicative of a greater problem.\n\nSo when should you get worried? If you have unexplainable neck pain (you haven't engaged in an activity\u2014like working out for the first time in a while\u2014that would have caused it), or if your neck pain is accompanied by some of the transverse myelitis symptoms, you should go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, Rabinovici says, \"Neck pain is not going to be any more serious than a pain in the neck.\"\n\nIn some instances, transverse myelitis will lead to another autoimmune disease, like multiple sclerosis or lupus, according to Balabanov. While patients are being treated, they need to be tested for other possible chronic diseases, he says. The patients should also be monitored for new symptoms every 3 to 6 months. \"Most patients recover completely,\" Rabinovici says. This recovery process could last anywhere from two weeks to several months, depending on the severity of the transverse myelitis. \"Unfortunately, not everyone has a complete resolution\u2014it's variable,\" Claire Riley, M.D., neurologist at Columbia University, tells SELF. The possibility of a full recovery is more likely with a swift diagnosis and regular treatment, Balabanov says.\n\n\"Life with transverse myelitis varies tremendously,\" Rabinovici says. \"Most people start to respond to treatment after a couple of weeks\u2014especially if they're seen right away.\" If the transverse myelitis is the result of an infection, doctors need to identify the source and treat patients with antibiotics or antiviral medication, Balabanov says. If not, the condition can be treated with steroids to limit inflammation and restore bodily function.\n\nThree months have passed since Finchman became paralyzed, and she can now reportedly feel some sensation when touched. She also has limited movement in her hands. \"My next goal is to be able to get in and out of bed by myself,\" she said. \"Some days are really difficult, but I keep going and try to stay strong for my family and friends.\" We wish Finchman a steady and full recovery.\n\nFinchman's sister started a crowdfunding effort to cover her sister's health expenses\u2014including any adaptive equipment she now needs.

But Jeff Sessions, as he prefers to call himself, is posed to take a starring role in the real-life Trump Administration. The Alabama senator has been tapped by Trump to be attorney general, charged with upholding the law and Constitution for all Americans.\u00a0\n\n\"Jeff has been a highly respected member of the U.S. Senate for 20 years. He is a world-class legal mind and considered a truly great Attorney General and U.S. Attorney in the state of Alabama,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Jeff is greatly admired by legal scholars and virtually everyone who knows him.\"\n\nThe key word here is \"virtually,\" because not everyone who knows Sessions admires him.\u00a0\n\nHis nomination for a federal judgeship was sunk years ago because of charges of racism.\u00a0Immigrants and civil rights advocates are rightfully critical of his radical policy positions. As attorney general, Sessions could play a major role in carrying out policies of a Trump administration \u2014 policies that could well harm Latinos and other Americans.\n\nSessions first came to national public attention back in 1986, when he was nominated by then-President Ronald Reagan to be a federal judge. That never happened, though, because of the sworn testimony of his colleagues. They told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Sessions had used the N-word, called an African-American prosecutor \"boy,\" and joked about liking the KKK.\u00a0\n\nSessions also reportedly called a white civil rights attorney a \"race traitor\" and dismissed the ACLU and the NAACP as \"un-American.\" As a result, the Republican-controlled Committee denied Sessions a spot on the federal bench. So the obvious question is that, if Sessions was unfit for a low-level judgeship, how can he be considered for attorney general?\n\nThe answer is that Sessions' hardliner approach to immigration appears to line up with that of the incoming administration. As senator, Sessions has opposed every piece of immigration reform legislation that included legalization or a path to citizenship for the undocumented.\u00a0Meanwhile, he has opposed Birthright Citizenship, which is enshrined in the Constitution thanks to the Fourteenth Amendment. Sessions is even against legal immigration, because he thinks too many people are coming into this country and creating \"cultural problems.\"\n\nSessions record on civil rights and human rights is equally troubling. He has defended Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the country, arguing in favor of a religious test for immigrants. He favors turning away unaccompanied children who arrive at the border, and sees refugees as \"economic and security threats.\" He voted against John McCain's bill to ban \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading\" treatment of detainees by the military. Not only does Sessions oppose President Obama's sensible criminal justice reforms, he believes that \"good people don't smoke marijuana.\" \u00a0\n\nIt should concern all reasonable citizens that Trump wants to install this narrow-minded individual with outdated views as the nation's highest legal officer. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLatinos have particular reasons to be wary of Sessions. He has called the Voting Right Act a \"piece of intrusive legislation.\" He led the GOP opposition to Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. And he is on record as saying that immigrants from the Dominican Republic are useless to our country. No wonder that Latino advocacy groups like the National Council of La Raza, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Hispanic Federation, and League of United Latin American Citizens have all come out against Session's nomination. They recognize that, based on his record, Sessions is no friend to our communities. \u00a0\n\nYes, as President Obama himself once stated, \"Elections have consequences.\" Having won the presidency, Trump has the right to choose whomever he wants for his Cabinet. That doesn't mean that the Senate should rubber stamp his choices. If anything, Sessions deserves intense scrutiny because of his past views and potential future responsibilities.\u00a0\n\nConsider that as head of the Department of Justice, Sessions would also oversee the DOJ's civil rights division, which almost seems like a bad joke. Or that as attorney general, Sessions would be very unlikely to investigate violations of the Voting Rights Act, which is critical in ensuring that minorities have access to the ballot, or to investigate police brutality, as Obama's DOJ did in Ferguson and Baltimore.\u00a0\n\nSessions has shown far more interest in rooting out and prosecuting (unsuccessfully) allegations of voter fraud. The New York Times Editorial Board was insightful in terming Sessions nomination an \"insult to justice.\" \u00a0\u00a0\n\nTrump's pick to serve as the nation's top law enforcement official is toxic to the American ideal of equality for all. Jeff Sessions should not be confirmed as our next attorney general.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRaul A.

This is what they are required to teach. They have no choice,\" she told me.\n\nMrs. Light did the right thing. She got involved in her child's education.

In a rare move,\u00a0Israel\u00a0called up hundreds of military reservists to join overstretched police and firefighters and was making use of an international fleet of firefighting aircraft sent by a slew of countries.\n\nThe Haifa blaze was the most serious in a series of fires that have erupted across the country in recent days. On a visit to the area, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said anyone implicated in setting the fires would be punished severely.\n\n\"It's a crime for all intents and purposes and in our opinion it is terror for all intents and purposes,\" he said. He said incitement to arson was also playing a role in spreading the fires.\n\nNetanyahu did not elaborate on the identity or motives of the suspected arsonists, but Israeli officials typically use the term \"terror\" to refer to Arab or Palestinian militant activity.\n\nIsrael\u00a0has been on edge during more than a year of Palestinian attacks, mostly stabbings, that have tapered off, but not halted, in recent months. Netanyahu has blamed Palestinian incitement for fueling those attacks.\n\nNetanyahu's accusations could test already brittle relations between\u00a0Israel's\u00a0Jewish majority and its Arab minority, which has long suffered discrimination in\u00a0Israel\u00a0and says it has been slighted by rhetoric from Netanyahu and other Israeli officials in the past.\n\nPublic Security Minister Gilad Erdan told Channel 10 TV news that eight people had been arrested and that authorities had found \"flammable materials and liquids poured in certain areas,\" a find that pointed to arson. He said arson was suspected in about half of the fires.\n\nIsraeli media said the Shin Bet internal security agency was helping search for perpetrators, while Erdan said \"we need to be prepared for a new type of terror.\"\n\n\"It's safe to assume that whoever is setting the fires isn't doing it only out of pyromania,\"\u00a0Israel's\u00a0police chief Roni Alsheich told reporters. \"It's safe to assume that if it is arson it is politically motivated.\"\n\nAyman Odeh, the head of a joint Arab bloc of parties in\u00a0Israel's\u00a0parliament and a Haifa native, appealed to Israelis to come together and abandon \"politics\" during the trying time.\n\n\"This is something that harms all of us. This is not a story of Arab or Jew. Whoever did this is an enemy of all of us,\" he told Israeli Channel 2 TV news.\n\nThe Palestinians meanwhile offered to send firefighting teams to help combat the flames, according to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA. Yousef Nassar, the director general of the Palestinian Civil Defense, said the offer of assistance was \"a humanitarian message.\" The Palestinians assisted\u00a0Israelduring a deadly wildfire in 2010.\u00a0Israel's\u00a0response to the offer was not immediately known.\n\nThe rash of fires is the worst since 2010, when\u00a0Israel\u00a0suffered the single deadliest wildfire in its history. That blaze burned out of control for four days, killed 42 people and was extinguished only after firefighting aircraft arrived from as far away as the United States.\n\nIsrael\u00a0has strengthened its firefighting capabilities since then, buying special planes that can drop large quantities of water on affected areas. Several countries, including Russia, France, Cyprus, Turkey, Croatia, Greece and Italy were also sending assistance to battle this week's blazes.\n\nResidents of eight neighborhoods in the northern city of Haifa were told to evacuate their homes on Thursday afternoon, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Or Doron, a spokeswoman for the city of Haifa, said some 50,000 people had been evacuated.\n\nPolice and firefighters were deployed throughout the city, as people loaded up supermarket carts with belongings and fled their homes. Some people connected hoses together from apartment buildings to help battle the fires, while residents held cloth over their faces.\n\nGuy Catlan, who runs a gas station in Haifa, told Channel 10 TV that workers turned the power off and were helping firefighters to prevent the flames from reaching it. \"There is a very large quantity of fuel here,\" he said. \"It is very dangerous to the entire area, it could be a big catastrophe.\"\n\nMichal Schanin, a professor at the University of Haifa, was in the middle of a lecture when she received word that she and her 70 students would need to evacuate. She said that while the evacuation was orderly, the flood of cars fleeing the area caused a traffic jam.\n\n\"We couldn't move. If, God forbid, there would have been fire there it would have been one huge trap,\" she said.\n\nThe military said it deployed two search and rescue battalions in order to assist civilian efforts. It also called up about 500 reserve soldiers to back up the police and fire departments.\n\nPolice said the blazes started early Tuesday morning at Neve Shalom, a community outside Jerusalem where Jews and Arabs live together. Fires later erupted elsewhere near Jerusalem and in the northern Israeli area of Zichron Yaakov.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.948968410491941, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 839, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.6566616720400003, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161124210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.86054827175209, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/13/sean-hannity-why-obama-democrats-and-never-trumpers-suddenly-care-about-cybersecurity.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1150, 5579]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 828, "scraper_regex": 897}}, "headline": "Sean Hannity: Why Obama, Democrats and Never Trumpers suddenly care about cybersecurity", "wordcount_as_scraped": 897, "date": "20161213150000", "story_content": "After President-elect Donald Trump's decisive victory, hacking suddenly matters to sore loser liberals, the Obama administration and of course, the never Trumpers.\n\nOver the weekend, The Washington Post and The New York Times, two abusively biased liberal mainstream media outlets, published stories saying that the CIA, without any concrete or new evidence, have concluded that Russian hackers tried to help Donald Trump win the election.\n\nTrump told \"Fox News Sunday\" what he thinks of those reports, and he nailed it.\n\n\"I think it's ridiculous,\" Trump told Chris Wallace, adding that he believes Democrats are pushing the story because they just got their clocks cleaned.\n\nGINGRICH: FUROR OVER CIA REPORT ON RUSSIAN ELECTION MEDDLING 'STUPID'\n\nThe incoming president then drew an interesting contrast in a subsequent tweet: \"Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and we tried to play the Russian/CIA card. It would be called a conspiracy theory!\"\n\nThe president-elect is absolutely right about this. On Monday, Clinton's campaign chairman, \u00a0John Podesta, said that Electoral College electors have the right to see intelligence on potential Russian hacking before they vote on Dec. 19. Imagine if the tables were turned and it was Donald Trump's campaign trying to do this? The left would go nuts!\n\nThe left's recount scheme failed miserably. So did their effort to blame the Electoral College system that has served our nation for more than two centuries. Ditto the attempt to pin the blame on \"fake news.\" Now, they're going to blame the Russians. It won't put Hillary Clinton in the White House, but President Obama and his fellow Democrats are hoping for the next best thing: to delegitimize Donald Trump.\n\nThe FBI, by the way, does not agree with the CIA on all of this because it has not found conclusive evidence that Russia was actually trying to help Trump win the election. Other government officials are now saying that the CIA's assessment of what happened isn't as clear-cut or definitive as the liberal mainstream media claims.\n\nIn other words, there is no consensus between the FBI and the CIA. And according to The New York Times, there's no new information, intelligence or evidence from the CIA's investigation into these allegations.\n\n\"Never Trumpers\" like Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham have joined Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for a \"bipartisan investigation\" into the so-called hacking. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said getting to the bottom of alleged Russian involvement in bringing to light emails that revealed Democratic dirty tricks \"must not be a partisan issue.\"\n\nWe shouldn't be surprised by any of this. Why? Because they all have one thing in common. They hate President-elect Trump.\n\nIf all of these people care so much about Russia's alleged hacking, why did they seem so unconcerned about Clinton's private server scandal and the great threat that that posed to our national security? FBI Director James Comey said Clinton's private server was less secure than a Gmail account, and Fox News Channel's Bret Baier's reported last month that authorities believe there is a 99 percent chance that up to five foreign intelligence agencies may have accessed Clinton's server and taken emails.\n\nNo one has offered proof as to who hacked Podesta's emails, but we do know who put them out and we know what they showed us. By publishing them online, WikiLeaks exposed how the mainstream media \u2013 not the Russians \u2013 were trying to influence the election in favor of Clinton win. The emails revealed how alt-radical left journalists sent their stories to Podesta and others for pre-publishing approval, went to his home for secret dinners and also how interim DNC chair Donna Brazile leaked debate questions to the Clinton campaign. How about doing an investigation into that?\n\nWikiLeaks leader Julian Assange has said that Russia did not give him the emails. Back in September, I interviewed him on my radio show and here's what he told me about the Democrats pushing a connection to Russia:\n\n\"The Democrats are always speaking about how terrible McCarthyism was,\" Assange said. \"And it was, in many ways. But at least the USSR actually existed then and there were actually Russian influence campaigns in the United States which were serious.\n\n\"What we're seeing now is Hillary Clinton and her campaign trying to whip up a near-McCarthyist hysteria, where she claims -- she claims that, effectively, Donald Trump is an agent to the Russians, that WikiLeaks is an agent to the Russians.\"\n\nAmerica has a major cybersecurity problem. In the past couple of years alone, government agencies like the Office of Personnel Management, the IRS, the Department of Defense, the State Department and the White House have all been hacked. Obama did little or nothing about those hacks, but now that his party has lost the White House, he has gotten religion on cybersecurity.\n\nBut the real goal of the Democratic Party's fake moral outrage machine is not to improve security or even get to the bottom of a hacking investigation.

Glenn, who married Annie in April 1943, once noted how her perseverance and strength through the years made him love her even more.\n\nWith Glenn's death Thursday at age 95, some of the focus has shifted to his widow, who is now 97. In a 1980 interview, Annie revealed that her stutter was once categorized as an 85 percent disability, meaning that 85 percent of the time she spoke, she could not make the words come out.\n\nWhen her husband became a household name in 1962, the press that followed proved difficult for Annie, who declined to speak during a Bob Hope special featuring the seven Mercury astronauts' wives. While she said the producers and others involved were kind, she felt that she had let them down by not even trying. Though at that point she had underwent three speech therapy courses, she felt they hadn't improved her speech as much as they had helped to boost her self-esteem.\n\n\"I can remember some very painful experiences \u2013 especially the ridicule,\" she told PEOPLE Magazine in 1980. \"People would tell me to hurry up or start shouting at me because they thought I was deaf and dumb.\"\n\nShe also feared that if something were to happen to her two children, she would be unable to call for help.\n\n\"Can you imagine living in the modern world and being afraid to use the telephone?\" she asked during the interview. \"'Hello' used to be so hard for me to say. I worried that my children would be injured and need a doctor. Could I somehow find the words to get the information across on the phone?\"\n\nIt wasn't until she turned 53 that she underwent three weeks of intensive specialized therapy at the Communications Research Institute at Hollins College in Roanoke, Virginia. As one of the programs first 100 students she was enrolled in the program which included 11 hour days spent working on breathing techniques and pronouncing one-syllable words, and continued to work with a speech therapist after completing it.\n\nAfter her experience at Hollins College, she gave a speech to 300 women in Ohio, and went on to campaign on behalf of her husband who was then running for senator.\n\nIn her mission to help spread awareness for others, Annie has served as a spokesperson for The Stuttering Foundation and has chaired National Stuttering Awareness Week. In addition to continuing with a speech therapist, she returned to Hollins twice to explore new research, but has emphasized that the program is not a perfect fit for all.\n\n\"The most important part of what's happened is now I can get my ideas across,\" Annie told PEOPLE. \"I used to be just a good listener; now I'm a chatterbox. My greatest pride is when I am able to encourage other stutterers to come out of hiding and tackle their problem. I have always had love and been happy. Now I want to help others feel that way too.\"\u00a0\n\nThank you Annie, for proving to us that with the power of will, anything is possible. I wish you peace during this difficult time, and am keeping you in my prayers today and always, as the country mourns the death of your beloved husband.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor.

Pat McCrory announced he would call legislators back to the Capitol on Wednesday to repeal the law known as HB2, which excludes sexual orientation and gender identity from antidiscrimination protections. The law also requires transgender people to use restrooms corresponding with the sex on their birth certificate in many public buildings.\n\nUndoing the law would be a step toward mending political divisions that remain raw well after Election Day. Just last week, lawmakers called a special session to strip Democratic Gov.-elect Cooper of some authority before he takes office next month.\n\nThe state's Republican leaders confirmed they're open to repealing HB2, but in a sign of lingering acrimony, they accused Cooper of taking too much credit for winning their cooperation.\n\nThe passage of HB2 in March thrust\u00a0North\u00a0Carolina\u00a0into a national debate on transgender rights and harmed the state economically. The state missed out on new jobs as companies declined to expand in the state, while cancellations of concerts and conventions exacted a toll. And in a huge symbolic blow to the basketball-crazy state, the NCAA and ACC relocated events.\n\nMonday's surprising events began in the morning when the Charlotte City Council voted to undo a local nondiscrimination law enacted in early 2016. That ordinance, Republicans legislators say, challenged social norms and spurred them to pass HB2.\n\n\"Senate Leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore assured me that as a result of Charlotte's vote, a special session will be called ... to repeal HB2 in full,\" Cooper said in a statement Monday morning. He initially said the session would be Tuesday.\n\nMcCrory said Democrats used the issue for political gain.\n\n\"This sudden reversal with little notice after the gubernatorial election sadly proves this entire issue, originated by the political left, was all about politics and winning the governor's race at the expense of Charlotte and the entire state of\u00a0North\u00a0Carolina,\" said McCrory, a former Charlotte mayor.\n\nBerger and Moore issued a joint statement saying they would take up the repeal if McCrory calls them into session. They said the debate over transgender bathroom access started with Charlotte and was pushed by Cooper as \"a political stunt to drive out-of-state money into the governor's race.\"\n\nRepublicans have defended the bathroom provisions as providing privacy and safety by keeping men out of women's restrooms. Opponents call it discriminatory.\n\nThe law was also seen as a referendum on McCrory, who became its national face. He lost by about 10,000 votes while fellow Republicans U.S. Sen. Richard Burr and President-elect Donald Trump comfortably won the state. McCrory was the first sitting\u00a0North\u00a0Carolina\u00a0governor elected to a four-year term to lose re-election.\n\nCharlotte City Council member Julie Eiselt said she spoke to Cooper late Sunday night about the city repealing the ordinance to pave the way for getting rid of HB2.\n\n\"We needed to know that the governor-elect had confidence that there would be a special session arranged to take a vote on this,\" Eiselt said.\n\nThe council's move is contingent on\u00a0North\u00a0Carolina\u00a0fully repealing HB2 by Dec. 31.\n\nRepublicans have said the Charlotte ordinance \u2014 which ensured transgender people the right to use restrooms corresponding to their gender identity \u2014 had to go first before they would consider getting rid of HB2.\n\nA repeal of the state law could also end protracted legal challenges by the federal Justice Department and transgender residents. Much of that litigation has been delayed while the U.S. Supreme Court hears a separate Virginia case on transgender restroom access.\n\nLGBT advocates were cautiously optimistic that the General Assembly would follow through with any repeal, but they also said antidiscrimination protection is an issue more important than politics.\n\n\"LGBT rights aren't a bargaining chip. Charlotte shouldn't have had to repeal its ordinance in exchange for HB2 to be repealed,\" Simone Bell, the Southern Regional Director for Lambda Legal, said in a statement. \"LGBT people in\u00a0North\u00a0Carolina\u00a0still need protection from discrimination.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.13903737068176, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 701, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.82589434181, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161219230000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.84878744650499, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/02/at-least-18-killed-after-suicide-bomber-targets-crowded-baghdad-market.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [80]}}, "headline": "At least 36 killed after suicide bomber targets crowded Baghdad market", "wordcount_as_scraped": 644, "date": "20170102110000", "story_content": "BAGHDAD \u2013 \u00a0A suicide bomber driving a pickup loaded with explosives struck a bustling market in Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 36 people in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group (ISIS) hours after French President Francois Hollande arrived in the Iraqi capital.\n\n\nThe bomb went off in a fruit and vegetable market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded.\n\n\nDuring a press conference with Hollande, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the bomber pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle.\n\n\nISIS claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a militant website often used by the extremists. It was the third ISIS-claimed attack in as many days in and around Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the group despite a string of setbacks elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul.\n\n\nThe attack took place in Sadr City, a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.\n\n\nShiite militiamen loyal to Muqtada al-Sadr, the firebrand cleric for whose family the neighborhood is named, were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Dead bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and laborers' shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire.\n\n\nAsaad Hashim, an owner of a mobile phone store nearby, described how the laborers pushed and shoved around the bomber's vehicle, trying to get hired.\n\n\n\"Then a big boom came, sending them up into the air,\" said the 28-year old, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed \"the most ineffective security forces in the world\" for failing to prevent the attack.\n\n\nAn angry crowd cursed the government, even after a representative of al-Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month, Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capital's 6 million residents.\n\n\n\"We have no idea who will kill at any moment and who's supposed to protect us,\" said Ali Abbas, a 40-year old father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. \"If the securities forces can't protect us, then allow us to do the job,\" he added.\n\n\nThree smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed another seven civilians and wounded at least 30, according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.\n\n\nHollande meanwhile met with al-Abadi and President Fuad Masum, and was expected to travel to the self-governing northern Kurdish region to meet French troops and local officials.\n\n\nIraqi troops, backed by a U.S.-led coalition, are fighting ISIS in a massive operation to retake the northern city of Mosul. Iraqi state TV said Hollande will discuss increasing support for Iraq and the latest developments in the 10-week-old offensive.\n\n\nHollande promised that France would remain a long-term ally of Iraq and called for coordination between intelligence services \"in a spirit of great responsibility,\" in remarks carried by his official Twitter account.\n\n\nFrance is part of the American-led coalition formed in 2014 to fight ISIS after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria. France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group.\n\n\nSince the Mosul operation started on Oct. 17, Iraqi forces have seized around a quarter of the city. Last week, the troops resumed fighting after a two-week lull due to stiff resistance by the militants and bad weather.\n\n\nMosul is Iraq's second largest city and the last major urban area in the country controlled by ISIS. Iraqi and U.S. commanders hope to drive ISIS from the city in the next three months.\n\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.169867038726809, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 619, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 21, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.954371961390001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170102110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.331179321486269, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/29/60-years-later-plane-crash-and-jail-prove-blessing-for-one-survivor.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1045, "scraper_regex": 1106}}, "headline": "60 years later, a plane crash and a jail prove \u2018a blessing\u2019 for one survivor", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1106, "date": "20170129130000", "story_content": "On Feb. 1, 1957, Miami-bound Northeast Airlines Flight 823 took off from New York's La Guardia Airport in near-blizzard conditions. Less than a minute later, its twisted wreckage lay engulfed in flames in a jail yard in a wreck that killed 20 and remains one of the most enigmatic crashes in aviation history.\n\nIn retrospect, the flight seemed doomed from the beginning: Its pilot had already been involved in two prior crashes, takeoff was delayed more than three hours and the weather was fierce. But what followed, after the plane dived into the grounds of the Rikers Island jail, added to the grim mystique that still surrounds the incident to this day.\n\n\"It was my first flight and my last flight; I never flew again,\" Phyllis Naylor, 91, a crash survivor, told Fox News from her home in Langhorne, Pa. \"My husband Charles had heard that the back of the plane was safer, so that's where we were.\"\n\nFlight 823, a Douglas DC-6A, was scheduled to leave La Guardia at 2:45 p.m. but wasn't clear for takeoff until 6:01 p.m. Crash investigators would later determine it reached an altitude of just 200 feet before going down.\n\nCLICK TO SEE PHOTOS OF THE FLIGHT 823 CRASH\n\nThe takeoff seemed fine, Naylor noted. \"But then I saw this 'oh-my-God look' on my husband's face; in an instant, the plane listed, the left wing was cut off and our side of the plane was tipped up real high.\"\n\nSeconds later, the plane was on the ground. As survivors among the flight's 101 passengers and crew stumbled from the wreckage and into the snow, their flesh burning and their cries piercing the evening air, Rikers Assistant Deputy Warden James Harrison made the unprecedented decision to release prisoners to aid in the rescue. It may have saved lives: The city's own first-responders were delayed getting to the scene by bad weather and a remote location.\n\nNaylor and her husband, who were going to Miami to celebrate his new gig as piano soloist in the Fred Waring Band, managed to get out of the plane, and jumped into a pile of snow. Naylor remembers that Charles and another passenger rolled her around in the snow and hers and Charles' hands and face were dripping. \"We realized eventually that it was our burning skin sliding off.\"\n\n\"The night was silent, except for the screams,\" Naylor said.\n\nPhyllis and Charles Naylor were taken to the prison chapel, and by the time they were transferred to Albert Einstein Hospital, \"my hands looked like toasted marshmallows,\" Naylor said. \"It was the worst pain of my life.\"\n\nAngel Gorbea, who witnessed the crash from his cell at Rikers Island before racing to the scene, told The Associated Press at the time: \"The whole sky, even through the snow, was lighted. We, the prisoners, stood at the windows. We saw people tumbling out of that ship -- they were all lighted, too, by the flames. We saw them and their shadows.\"\n\nTugboats maneuvered to the scene, slogging through the East River to reach the victims.\n\n\"When we got there, people were falling out of the wings of the plane and the fuselage,\" tugboat Capt. Earl Jensen told WNYC reporter Monroe Benton.\n\nThe Naylors spent two months in the hospital, and Charles' hands were so damaged that he was unable to resume his career as a pianist. Charles, who died in 1994, put his energy into composing music, unable to stretch his hands in the way required to perform classical pieces. Phyllis was a high school English and drama teacher.\n\nThe pilot, Capt. Alva Marsh, later told investigators he believed the plane struck a pole, causing it to dip sharply left and sending it downward. Upon impact, the plane's left wing was sheared off and its outboard engine ripped from its mounting as it burst into flames.\n\nMarsh had been in the cockpit during crashes in 1952 and 1953. In each of those accidents, no one died. This time, the dead included a child.\n\nInside the jail, Harrison gave the order to release more than 50 inmates known as \"trusties\" -- prisoners whose good behavior had earned the guards' trust. They raced to the scene to help stunned passengers and crew. Every single inmate returned to their cell later that night.\n\nOne stewardess who worked the flight, Doris Ostermann, suffered catastrophic injuries shepherding passengers to safety.\n\n\"She was terribly deformed; her nose and ears were burned away,\" Paula Aubee, Ostermann's niece, told Fox News.\n\n\"It was shocking as a child to see those physical traits,\" recalled Aubee, who was 8 at the time of the crash. \"But my aunt was always fun-loving. She never lost that.\"\n\nOstermann, who was Doris Steele at the time of the crash, had aided in two historic airlifts during the 1940s: She led Jewish refugees from China to Israel and participated in the Berlin Airlift.\n\n\"She loved every minute of being a stewardess and was outrageously in love with flying,\" Aubee said. As Ostermann healed, Aubee remembered how her aunt said she couldn't wait to get back on a plane, although her injuries kept her from a career as a stewardess. \"She couldn't pick things up.\"\n\n\"She was an adventurer. She was this fairy godmother to us,\" said Linda Nilsson, another niece of Ostermann, \"bringing us things from all around the world.\"\n\nOstermann died in 2010 of a stroke at the age of 87.\n\nFor their part in the rescue, 30 of the 57 inmates who ran to help were released and another 16 had their sentences reduced by the New York City Parole Board. Mayor Robert Wagner bestowed on Harrison the Correction Department's highest award: the Medal of Honor.\n\nThe Civil Aeronautics Board investigators determined that Marsh's inability to properly interpret the plane's flight instruments was the probable cause of the crash. Marsh never again flew an airliner. He was reassigned to a desk job at Northeast Airlines. He died in Florida in 1985 at the age of 78.\n\nCLICK TO READ THE CIVIL AERONAUTICS BOARD REPORT\n\nThe crash shows that \"life is uncertain and men are frail and make mistakes,\" Alvin Moscow, who wrote about the Flight 823 crash in his book \"Tiger on a Leash,\" told Fox News. \"This is one crash where everything that could go wrong with a plane did go wrong.\"\n\nFor Phyllis Naylor, the crash was, in some odd way, \"a blessing.\"\n\n\"You remember the kindness -- of an African-American inmate who gave me a cloth to wrap my hands, of the doctor who treated my burns.

About 50 officers stood across from the protesters, and the crowd eventually dispersed.\n\nMorton County sheriff's office spokesman Rob Keller said officers near the campsites about 50 miles south of Mandan observed protesters attempting to build a wooden bridge over a body of water Thursday morning in an effort to reach Turtle Island, a hill where protesters claim burial sites are located. Keller said between 350 and 400 protesters eventually gathered at Turtle Island.\n\nKeller said one protester told officers they were \"ready to die today.\" Another said, \"Remember '73?\" referring to Wounded Knee.\n\nIn Portland, Oregon, hundreds of people rallied in the rain Thursday to show their solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and others who have spent months protesting the pipeline's construction.\n\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reports (https://goo.gl/X4DGdy) that more than 350 people took part in the demonstration at the city's Pioneer Courthouse Square. Attendees chanted, \"Stop the pipeline\" and \"Water rights are human rights.\"\n\nShannon Berger-Hammond co-founded a group called Families for Peaceful Protest, which organized the Portland rally. She said Thanksgiving is \"meant to highlight peace and thanks and community and to celebrate indigenous nations, and the indigenous nations are suffering right now.\"\n\nThe Standing Rock Sioux and others oppose the 1,200-mile, four-state pipeline being built to carry oil from western North Dakota to a shipping point in Illinois because they say it threatens drinking water on the nearby reservation and cultural sites. Pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners has said no sites have been disturbed and that the $3.8 billion pipeline will be safe.\n\nThe pipeline is largely complete except for the section under a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota, and ETP Chief Executive Kelcy Warren has said the company is unwilling to reroute the project.\n\nProtests against the pipeline have intensified in recent weeks, with arrests since August totaling more than 520.\n\nActress Shailene Woodley, who was among 27 activists arrested Oct. 10, was at one of the campsites Thursday. She live-streamed activities and was expected to help serve Thanksgiving dinner to protesters later in the day.\n\nAt least one person was arrested during Thursday's demonstration in Mandan, a community adjacent to the capital city of Bismarck.

While the search for Number 45 might have dominated most news cycles, it was not the only political story of interest to make headlines. Below is a look at the top 16 numbers that dominated the political news over the last year.\n\n0: Number of times Hillary Clinton visited Wisconsin during the general election. This was a very poor strategy on the part of the Clinton team. In the end, Wisconsin proved to be one of three key \"blue wall,\" Rust belt battleground states. Wisconsin, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, cost the Democratic party the 2016 election.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n5: Number of times in American history that the winner of the popular vote has lost the Electoral College. It happened this year when Clinton was awarded 2.8 million votes more than Trump, but lost the Electoral College (304-227). Prior to that it had only happened four times in U.S. history: 1824 (Jackson v. Adams), 1876 (Tilden v. Hayes), 1888 (Cleveland v. Harrison), and 2000 (Gore v. Bush).\n\n8: Number of justices on the Supreme Court since Associate Justice Antonin Scalia passed away earlier this year. President Obama swiftly appointed Merrick Garland to fill the vacant seat, however Republicans resisted taking up his confirmation choosing instead to wait until after the election. This now gives President-elect Trump an opportunity to name Scalia's replacement, almost immediately, on taking office. Additionally, considering the ages of the more liberal members of the bench, opens up the prospect for Trump in the coming four-year term to shift the ideological balance on the Supreme Court in a dramatic way.\n\n33: Number of governorships that Republicans control. This is a record and indicative of how dominant the GOP is, not only at the federal level, but across the country as well where they control 4,171 of 7383 state legislative seats. Republicans now control both the state legislature and governorships in 25 of 50 states, while Democrats have just 12.\n\n49: Number of people killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando when a gunman opened fire in late June. There were also 53 people who were wounded in the attack, making it the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, and the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since September 11th, 2001. During the three-hour standoff the gunman pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, sparking tremendous debate about ways to combat terrorism, homegrown terrorism, gun control, mental illness, mental health funding, and open borders.\u00a0\n\n51.9: Percent of Britons who voted in June to leave the European Union. The inexorable outcome of the Brexit vote which resulted in the resignation of a British Prime Minister, and astounded pundits and prognosticators who, up until the results were announced, were convinced that \"stay\" would win the day.\n\n85: Percent chance, according to the New York Times that Clinton would defeat Trump. The Times was not alone in their miscalculation, the Huffington Post gave Clinton a 98 percent chance of winning, Princeton Election Consortium's forecast gave her 99 percent and Nate Silvers FiveThirtyEight website predicted an approximately 71 percent chance of a Clinton win.\n\n88: Number of years since a U.S. president had visited Cuba. President Obama's promise to re-establish ties with the nation culminated in a historic visit this year. One which garnered praise from some quarters and denunciations from others, particularly those of Cuban descent who are opposed to relations with the Castro regime. In late November, several months after his visit, the 90-year old former dictator Fidel Castro passed away.\n\n309: Number of people arrested for protesting against police shootings of black men in late August. The protests erupted in cities across the country in response to the killings, one day apart, of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. Days later, a gunman killed five police officers at a Black Lives Matter rally. Officers were also subject to attack at rallies in Tennessee, Missouri, and Georgia. These incidents renewed the debate across the nation over police-community relations, policing practices, and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n1,000: Number of Democratic seats lost during President Obama's eight years in office. Yet Obama himself remains popular with approval ratings similar to those of Clinton and Reagan when they left office. Either way he leaves the Democratic Party weakened at the local, state, and national levels. The strength of their bench matters when it comes to potentially recapturing the White House, Senate or House. Another mark of their bench challenge? Governors make good candidates for the presidency, right now Democrats have only 16, which means Republicans have almost double the amount of talent to draw on.\n\n6,500: Number of Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta's hacked emails were released by WikiLeaks as of mid-October. The emails revealed some embarrassing information about the party and led to the resignation of its Chairwoman, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The CIA and Obama administration claim that Russia, in an attempt to throw the election to Trump, was behind the hacking. As of late December some key Republicans in the Senate have joined Democrats in calling for an investigation and the Obama administration has vowed to retaliate.\n\n16,000: Number of casualties estimated to have died as a result of violent ideological extremism worldwide. This includes approximately 1,800 separate terrorist attacks around the globe including in Nice, Kabul, Pakistan, Brussels and Yemen. Various groups have claimed responsibility for these attacks including Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Al-Qaeda, Boko-Haram, Jamiat-i-Islamiyah, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, Al-Shabaab, and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.\n\n33,000: Number of emails Clinton was accused of having destroyed (by Trump and others) after receiving a subpoena. The FBI investigated Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. Director James Comey was critical of Clinton's use of the server but during the summer said he would not recommend pursuing criminal charges. Months later and just 12 days before the election, Comey sent a letter to Congress stating they had discovered more emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation. Despite later clearing her once again, after the election many Democrats saw this as critical to her loss.\n\n400,000: Number of casualties in the Syrian War as estimated by the United Nations and Arab League Envoy to Syria. Other estimates range from as low as 312,000 to as high as 470,000 \u2013 this includes civilians, women, children, rebels, and government forces. As of late December the Syrian government had recaptured all of Aleppo from the rebels, their biggest victory of the almost 6 year civil war. Days later Syria agreed to a cease fire brokered by Russia and Turkey, the first since a cease fire in September which collapsed after a week.\n\n18.1 Million: Number of people who follow @realDonaldTrump on Twitter. As both, a candidate and now president-elect, over the last year, Trump has redefined what it means to go over the head of the press and to reach people directly. After the election he credited Twitter with helping lead him to victory and described it as \"tremendous, it's a modern form of communication. There should be nothing we should be ashamed of.\"\n\n$6.9 Billion: Estimated total cost of the 2016 election for both Congress and the presidency. This makes it the most expensive race in American history. In the race for the Presidency alone, the election cost approximately $2,651 billion. However money didn't rule the day, Clinton outspent Trump almost two-to-one only to go on to lose the election.\n\n\n\nJeanne Zaino, Ph.D. is professor of Political Science and International Studies at Iona College and Senior Advisor at AppliedTechonomics, Public Sector.

To save him, surgeons will have to totally reroute how his blood flows, a drastic treatment that doesn't always work.\n\nSo this time they are going a step further. In a bold experiment, doctors injected donated stem cells directly into the healthy side of Josue Salinas Salgado's little heart, aiming to boost its pumping power as it compensates for what's missing.\n\nIt's one of the first attempts in the U.S. to test if stem cells that seem to help heart attack survivors repair cardiac muscle might help these tiniest heart patients, too.\n\n\"We think the young heart is able to be more responsive,\" said Dr. Sunjay Kaushal, chief of pediatric cardiac surgery at the University of Maryland Medical Center, who is leading the study in partnership with University of Miami researchers.\n\nKaushal bent over the baby's right ventricle, the part of the heart that will take over for the abnormal left side. The surgeon had repaired as much as possible for now. Next he measured where to place eight shots of precious stem cells.\n\nThen the bustling operating room went silent as Kaushal helped fellow surgeon Dr. Si M. Pham guide tiny needles into the ventricle's muscle.\n\n\"We're not saying we're going to cure it,\" Kaushal said of the birth defect, called hypoplastic left heart syndrome. But, \"my whole quest is to see if we can make these little kids do better.\"\n\nJosue's parents knew there was no guarantee the experimental injections would make a difference. But their son had been hospitalized since birth and needed open-heart surgery anyway for a chance to go home. Teary-eyed, they clasped hands and prayed over Josue's crib moments before nurses wheeled him to the operating room.\n\n\"We are marching ahead with God,\" said Josue's father, Hidelberto Salinas Ramos, speaking in Spanish through a hospital interpreter.\n\n_____\n\nNearly 1,000 babies are born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome in the U.S. each year. It's the most complex cardiac birth defect.\n\nJosue is missing his left ventricle, the main pumping chamber that pushes oxygen-rich blood to the body. Other key structures on his heart's left side are too small or malformed to work.\n\nAlways lethal until a few decades ago, this defect now is treated with three open-heart surgeries performed between birth and age 3. Doctors route blood around the abnormal left heart and they convert the right ventricle \u2014 which normally would shuttle oxygen-poor blood to the lungs \u2014 into the main pumping chamber.\n\nToday, about 65 percent survive at least five years, and many reach adulthood, said Dr. Kristin Burns, a pediatric cardiologist at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nBut too many children still die or require a heart transplant because the right ventricle wears out under its increased workload.\n\nThat's why doctors are conducting this early-stage study of whether stems cells might help that ventricle work better.\n\n\"This is very different than a surgical approach or giving a medicine just to treat the symptoms. This is trying to treat the underlying problem,\" said Burns, of NIH's National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.\n\n_____\n\n\"I know you're really nervous,\" Kaushal told Josue's father, placing a hand on his shoulder. \"Everything is going to be fine.\"\n\nJust 4 months old, Josue was undergoing his second open-heart surgery. The first operation, a day after his birth, was a temporary fix to keep his heart pumping and create an aorta, the main artery leading to the body, big enough for blood to flow. While he babbled happily at his family and nurses, Josue never got strong enough to be discharged to his Edgewater, Maryland, home. This time, Kaushal would take pressure off Josue's right ventricle \u2014 and inject those stem cells.\n\nEven in adults, stem cell regeneration is highly experimental. But small studies involving heart attack survivors and older adults with heart failure have found what Dr. Denis Buxton, a stem cell specialist at NIH's heart institute, calls a modest benefit in how well their hearts pump blood.\n\nFor testing in babies, Kaushal turned to Dr. Joshua Hare at the University of Miami's Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute, who researches a specific type of stem cell donated from the bone marrow of healthy adults. Hare's institute freezes these so-called mesenchymal stem cells, which have a long safety record in adult studies, and is providing them free for the baby study.\n\nInitially, Kaushal's team tested piglets, whose hearts are similar to humans. When the right ventricle was damaged, they found stem cell injections preserved the piglets' heart tissue. Apparently the cells spurred some of the heart's existing repair mechanisms.\n\nBack in the Baltimore operating room, University of Miami researchers helped Kaushal's nurses thaw the frozen stem cells and prepare injections. A few feet away, Kaushal was moving a large vein so it will drain deoxygenated blood from the top of Josue's body straight to his lungs without having to enter that overworked right ventricle. (When he's 3, Josue will need a final operation to similarly reroute blood returning from his lower body.)\n\nThen, just before his chest was stitched back up, Josue became the second baby with this defect to receive the experimental bone marrow stem cells.\n\nIt's an early-stage study that will compare 30 babies, half given stem cells, to see if the strategy is safe and shows any difference over surgery alone. If so, it could open stem cell research for other pediatric heart problems.\n\nOther types of stem cells also are being explored for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Mayo Clinic researchers have tested stem cells taken from affected babies' umbilical cord blood. Kaushal also plans to try stem cells from affected newborns' own heart tissue, something researchers in Japan are pursuing.\n\nIt will take several years to know if stem cell experiments work. But, like many babies after their second surgery for the heart defect, Josue bounced back \u2014 and a week later, finally got to go home.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.9767441749572794, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 986, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.2814224870199995, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.4340770791075, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2016/12/22/emma-stone-reveals-lost-her-mind-on-birdman-set.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3564]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 784, "scraper_regex": 857}}, "headline": "Emma Stone reveals she lost her mind on 'Birdman' set", "wordcount_as_scraped": 857, "date": "20161222160000", "story_content": "Emma Stone is getting candid about her past film experiences.\n\nThe 28-year-old actress covers the latest edition of Rolling Stone, and reveals a few of her not so pleasant times on set. Stone calls out sexism in Hollywood, which she says she's experienced firsthand.\n\n\"There are times in the past, making a movie, when I've been told that I'm hindering the process by bringing up an opinion or an idea,\" Stone says. \"I hesitate to make it about being a woman, but there have been times when I've improvised, they've laughed at my joke and then given it to my male co-star -- given my joke away. Or it's been me saying, 'I really don't think this line is gonna work,' and being told, 'Just say it, just say it, if it doesn't work we'll cut it out' -- and they didn't cut it out, and it really didn't work!'\"\n\nNEWS: EXCLUSIVE -- Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling on Their 'Lucky' Chemistry and Becoming the Bogart & Hepburn of Their Time\n\nLater, Stone recalls being pushed to the limits when shooting director Alejandro Inarritu's \"Birdman\" or (\"The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\"). Although the work definitely paid off -- she was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 2015 for her role as Sam -- she acknowledges that at one point, she \"lost [her] mind\" trying to perfect a scene for the notoriously hard-to-please director.\n\n\"I had to come in at the very end of this one scene, and it was so scary, because everything was timed out,\" she explains. \"Alejandro told me, 'Emma, you have to go faster around the corner or it's going to ruin the movie!' And I was like, this is a horror, this is so hard, it's actually insane.\"\n\n\"Later that night, Edward Norton and I were shooting on a rooftop at, like, 2 a.m.,\" she continues. \"We'd done this scene 30 times, and Alejandro wasn't getting what he wanted. He said, 'Maybe it's not going to work.' I went to my dressing room, pacing, like, 'I can't do it. I'm losing my f--king mind.' This thing came over me. I'm usually a people-pleaser, but I felt like, 'F--k it. I don't even care anymore.' So when we went back to do the scene, I was crazy. I spit during a take. And Alejandro goes, 'Beautiful -- there it is!'\"\n\nThe always affable actress does admit it's difficult for her to play unlikable characters on screen because of her natural desire to please.\n\n\"If part of what you've craved in your life is to not upset anybody, it's easy to be drawn to characters that aren't gonna upset anybody,\" she says of her career so far.\n\nThe A-list actress also talks about battling severe anxiety growing up in the candid interview, including the feelings that brought up her debilitating panic attacks.\n\n\"My brain [was] naturally zooming 30 steps ahead to the worst-case scenario,\" she shares. \"When I was about seven, I was convinced the house was burning down. I could sense it -- not a hallucination, just a tightening in my chest, feeling I couldn't breathe, like the world was going to end. There were some flare-ups like that, but my anxiety was constant. I would ask my mom a hundred times how the day was gonna lay out. What time was she gonna drop me off? Where was she gonna be? What would happen at lunch? Feeling nauseous. At a certain point, I couldn't go to friends' houses anymore -- I could barely get out the door to school.\"\n\nStone, who was homeschooled at 12 years old, credits performing and seeing a therapist with helping her cope.\n\n\"It helped so much,\" she says of her therapy sessions. \"I wrote this book called 'I Am Bigger Than My Anxiety'\u00a0that I still have: I drew a little green monster on my shoulder that speaks to me in my ear and tells me all these things that aren't true. And every time I listen to it, it grows bigger. If I listen to it enough, it crushes me. But if I turn my head and keep doing what I'm doing -- let it speak to me, but don't give it the credit it needs -- then it shrinks down and fades away.\"\n\nLately, the \"La La Land\" actress says she feels anxiety about the results of the presidential election. Stone was an avid supporter of Hillary Clinton, who lost to now President-elect Donald Trump.\n\n\"It's still so hard to process what happens next, or what to do,\" she says. \"It's terrifying, the not-knowing. But I can't stop thinking about vulnerable people being ignored and tossed aside -- marginalized more than they've already been for hundreds of years -- and how the planet will die without our help. It comes in waves.\"\n\nWATCH: Andrew Garfield Admits He Still Loves Emma Stone\n\nThese days, Stone is busy still promoting her critically acclaimed musical \"La La Land,\" which has already earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy.

The Senate intelligence committee is able to investigate the matter, he added.\n\nCIA Director John Brennan has said the intelligence community is in agreement that Russia tried to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, although there's no evidence Moscow succeeded in helping Trump win.\n\n\"There's no question that the Russians were messing around in our election,\" McConnell told Kentucky Educational Television on Monday night. \"It is a matter of genuine concern and it needs to be investigated.\"\n\nPODESTA: RUSSIAN BEHIND US HACKING, WANTED TRUMP AS ITS WHITE HOUSE 'LAP DOG'\n\nStill, McConnell said the issue should be investigated in \"regular order\" by the Senate intelligence panel, which is \"fully capable of handling this.\"\n\nMcConnell's comments put him at odds with Arizona Sen. John McCain and other Republicans who have joined with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in calling for a special committee to investigate efforts by Russia, China and Iran to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\nA select committee is a high-profile panel created by congressional leaders that taps lawmakers from a variety of committees to focus on a single issue, such as Watergate or the Iran-contra arms deal.\n\nMcCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Russian interference in the election threatens to \"destroy democracy,\" adding that a select committee is needed to find out exactly what Russia did and what effect it had on the election.\n\n\"We need to get to the bottom of this,\" McCain said. \"We need to find out exactly what was done and what the implications of the attacks were, especially if they had an effect on our election.\"\n\nHe said: \"There's no doubt they were interfering and no doubt that it was cyberattacks. The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we have been totally paralyzed.\"\n\nMEDIA POUND TRUMP ON RUSSIA\n\nTrump has called reports of Russian hacking \"ridiculous,\" and his transition team dismissed the CIA assessment, saying it was the work of the same people who claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction before the U.S. invaded.\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that the investigation must be bipartisan.\n\n\"We don't want this investigation to be political like the Benghazi investigation,\" he said. \"We don't want it to just be finger pointing at one person or another.\" Schumer added: \"We want to find out what the Russians are doing to our political system and what other foreign governments might do to our political system. And then figure out a way to stop it.\"\n\nMcCain, Schumer and other senators say a select committee is needed to \"reconcile contradictory information\" and give the issue needed focus.\n\nIn the interview with KET's Bill Goodman, McConnell spoke of his surprise at the election's outcome.\n\n\"I thought we'd come up short\" in the Senate, McConnell said. \"And I didn't think President Trump had a chance of winning.\"\n\nTrump won in part because he was able to connect with rural voters in states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that had previously voted for Democrats, McConnell said.\n\n\"Trump was able to convey \u2014 oddly enough a message from a billionaire who lives in Manhattan \u2014 a genuine concern for people who felt kind of left off, who felt offended by all the political correctness they see around them,\" he said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.70807456970215, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 580, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.4431370787600002, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.06896551724138, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/01/need-strong-leader-trumps-popularity-high-among-iraqis.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [79, 7655]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1233, "scraper_regex": 1297}}, "headline": "'We need a strong leader': Trump's popularity high among Iraqis", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1297, "date": "20161101120000", "story_content": "BAGHDAD, Iraq \u2013 \u00a0Donald Trump's favorability rating is sky-high here, where citizens are paying surprisingly close attention to the U.S. election and see the developer and political novice as the clear choice for the White House.\n\nIn dozens of interviews FoxNews.com conducted in various cities across the country this month \u2013 with Iraqis from different religions and walks of life \u2013 the overwhelming majority support Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Many believe Trump would be tough on terror, and blame Clinton \u2013 at least in part \u2013 for policies that have destabilized much of the Middle East.\n\n\"America should leave the political correctness and be tough on these countries that finance terrorism,\" Nseeif Al-Khattabi, a Shia Muslim and governor of the Holy Karbala Province Council, told FoxNews.com. \"We need a strong leader and if Trump needs me to speak at a rally I will come. If he follows his words and his strong stance and points his fingers at these countries that support terrorism, he will be able to stop it.\"\n\nAnother very highly-placed leader in Iraq's security and intelligence arena, who requested anonymity, stressed that the U.S. troop pullout in 2011 was a mistake, and said Iraqis are looking to the next administration to once again develop a strong military relationship.\n\n\"The Iraq invasion was not wrong, but the decisions that followed were wrong,\" said the official. \"Keeping the army intact and getting rid of the Saddam loyalist bad apples, while keeping our security institutions in place would have been better.\"\n\nMamoul Al-Samraaii, the Baghdad-based head of the Al Itfaq political party, a non-sectarian, economy-focused bloc, said he was impressed meeting Clinton as Secretary of State in 2010 and that he was also impressed by Trump's business acumen. But ultimately, Samraaii noted, choosing his words carefully, he is looking to the next U.S. President for support in propelling Iraq into a more capitalist economy with imports and exports beyond the oil market.\n\n\"If there is a problem in the world, it seems Republicans take over,\" he said. \"When things are good, Democrats win. Republicans will likely have a better chance this time, with all the problems in our world.\"\n\nGen. Sarhad Qader Mohammad, director of the districts and towns of Kirkuk Province Police Department, believes Trump will help fight ISIS on its home turf.\n\n\"I believe that America has always had a stable policy in fighting terrorism, but Hillary has a softer approach,\" he said. \"Trump is much harder when it comes to these issues, he won't put up with it.\"\n\nEven though the operation is underway to liberate ISIS from its stronghold in the northern city of Mosul, many recognize that peace can be fragile and fleeting, and that much of the nation \u2013 in particular the capital Baghdad \u2013 is still rife with terror.\n\nAccording to the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), the country has seen an uptick in violence since 2013, and just over three months ago experienced its worst suicide attack since 2003 \u2013 one which killed more than 300 people in the popular shopping district of Karrada.\n\nThe topic of American politics makes for impassioned conversation among young Iraqis, who huddle in trendy hookah and coffee bars and upscale malls in major cities.\n\n\"I am for Trump,\" Saif Hussein, a 27-year-old flight engineer, told FoxNews.com, glancing out at the still charred remains of the Karrada market, juxtaposed with a bursting nightlife of people unabashedly getting on with life along one of Baghdad's \"most bombed\" concourses.\n\n\"I hope that U.S. policy changes after the elections, and helps us to further eliminate the militants and terrorist financiers who support them. It was a mistake to withdraw that quickly. I want the whole world to know that the Iraqi people love life, and want a fair state. We have lost a lot of young people to war, but we still have hope for peace.\"\n\nDr. Zainab Abbas Elshafei, a 26-year-old gynecologist from a mixed Sunni and Shia family in the south of Baghdad near Babil, echoed that the U.S. elections are coming at a crucial time given their nation's enduring violence.\n\n\"The USA as a country is considered the main leader and engine for the international alliance against ISIS, so the next president will really determine if the war to eliminate them fully will be serious or not,\" she said. \"I prefer Trump because of his opinions about the countries supporting terrorism, especially Saudi Arabia. We are against militant Islam. And Hillary Clinton was Obama's Secretary of State \u2013 they made ISIS by using all the wrong strategies, and now they are having to fight it.\"\n\nWhile many Iraqis say they feel somewhat let down by the United States for an invasion followed by an abrupt withdrawal before stability was reached, the overall consensus pointed to a long term presence and tight relationship between the two countries.\n\nAnd even though relations between Baghdad Central Government and the northern, semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) remain strained, the two governments are coordinating to expel ISIS from Mosul and appear to at least agree when it comes to backing Trump.\n\n\"This election is very important to the Kurdish people as a friend to the United States,\" said Kurdish political journalist Aso Haji. \"We have seen eight years of Democrats in Iraq, and their policies are not in favor of our desires, they care more about a unified Iraq. But we are focused on our independence.\"\n\nThe Republican Party has long been viewed as a beacon of hope for many Kurds, who see the American GOP as more likely to support their ambition of independence. The Bush administration was immensely popular after taking out Saddam Hussein, and streets in Kurdish cities and villages often bear the name of the American political dynasty.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton as Secretary showed that she is a danger not just to Iraq, but the region at-large. Look at all the instability in Yemen, Afghanistan, Libya,\" Haji said. \"Obama was the worst president of all and we fear she will be even worse. We see Mr. Trump as a more honest person, and America should be led by an honest person. And besides, how can we trust a woman who cannot uphold her dignity as a wife and a mother who stands by her husband through all types of scandals? How can she be trusted to defend the interests of a great nation like America?\"\n\nMinority factions such as Christians and Yazidis - officially victims of ISIS genocide - also generally said the support Trump.\n\nYazidis who spoke to FoxNews.com said they want the next White House to lead the way in establishing \"international protection\" for their people. A strong sense of betrayal has cemented itself among Yazidis, tens of thousands who are now scattered in squalor across the north of the country, driven from their homes and, in many cases, slaughtered and enslaved by their Arab neighbors.\n\n\"It was our neighbors, the Arabs we knew for decades, who turned their weapons on us,\" one Yazidi community leader who asked only to be identified as Haider, lamented from their sacred temple of Lalish. \"My whole family is gone. How can we ever trust them again? How can we trust Hillary Clinton who is afraid to call it what it is: Islamic terrorism? This matters to us.\"\n\nYet for others, the reason for their apprehension is far simpler.\n\n\"She is a woman,\" stated Waseem, a mid-40's Baghdad native who worked for high-level U.S government branches in both interpreter and cultural advising roles. \"I don't know if most Iraqis are ready for that.\"\n\nSteven Nabil contributed to this report\u00a0\n\n\n\nHollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

Over the next few years, the X-ray technician from Albuquerque, New Mexico, developed a persistent cough and wheezing, which her doctors attributed to exercise-induced asthma. She had other symptoms, too: weight loss, fever, and several bouts of pneumonia. Still, when Rivas finally decided to perform a chest X-ray on herself, cancer was the last thing on her mind.\n\nThe image revealed a mass on her right lung that turned out to be a malignant tumor. Rivas was 32 and had never smoked a cigarette in her life. \"I want people to know lung cancer can happen to anyone,\" she says.\n\nRivas has joined the American Lung Association's Lung Force campaign, to spread the word that her disease isn't just a smoker's affliction. \"It's true that the majority of people with lung cancer have some history of tobacco use,\" says Lung Association spokesperson Andrea McKee, MD, the chair of radiation oncology at Lahey Hospital Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts. \"Having said that, 15% of patients diagnosed with lung cancer have no history of tobacco use\u2014and they may be quite young.\"\n\nOther known risk factors aside from smoking include a family history of the disease, as well as exposure to certain air pollutants, such as asbestos, arsenic, radon, even diesel fumes, says Dr. McKee. Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide; and each year, it kills more women than breast, ovarian, and uterine cancer combined.\n\nRELATED: 25 Breast Cancer Myths Busted\n\nIf it's diagnosed early, the disease is actually highly curable, Dr. McKee says. Luckily this was the case for Rivas. She had her tumor removed in 2013, and is now thriving. (She ran a half-marathon last year!)\n\nBut only about 16% of cases are caught at stage 1. \"Usually it's like a 7- to 8-millimeter nodule sitting in the middle of a lung that doesn't have any symptoms associated with it,\" says Dr. McKee. Most patients are diagnosed later, once the tumor has grown large enough that it's \"pushing on an airway, resulting in some breathing problems,\" she explains.\n\nThat's what Marlo Palacio experienced just before the holidays in 2013, when she developed a cough unlike any cough she'd ever had before. \"I would feel like I was out of breath or gagging,\" she says. At first, the social worker from Pasadena, California, assumed she'd picked up a bug from her toddler son. But six weeks later, the cough hadn't gone away. Doctors diagnosed Palacio\u2014an otherwise healthy, 39-year-old non-smoker\u2014with stage 4 lung cancer.\n\nAt stage 4, lung symptoms like Palacio had (and others such as pneumonia and coughing up blood) may be accompanied by problems elsewhere in the body, such as back pain, bone pain, headaches, weight loss, and confusion, says Dr. McKee. That's because \"once the disease has spread, [it's] usually having an effect on a system outside of the lungs,\" she explains.\n\nAfter several different treatments, Palacio developed a new, isolated tumor in September. But she says she is doing well, physically and emotionally. \"I'm feeling pretty positive that this will be something that we can just eliminate and maintain,\" she says. \"I just accept that this is a lifelong fight for maintenance, and keeping my cancer down.\"\n\nRELATED: 6 Cancer-Fighting Superfoods\n\nDr. McKee is hopeful that rising awareness of lung cancer, and advances in screening will mean fewer late-stage diagnoses in the future\u2014because catching the disease early can make all the difference.\n\nFrida Orozco knows that fact first-hand. She was diagnosed with stage 2 in her late twenties, a few months after she developed a dry cough. \"I started to feel a pain every time I coughed on the lower side of my ribs, and also on the left side of my chest, near the clavicle,\" she says. When Orozco came down with a fever, headaches, and dizziness, she went to an urgent care facility; a chest X-ray revealed the mass in her lung.\n\nBut today, the 30-year-old student at Borough of Manhattan Community College happily reports she has been in remission for a year and a half. \"You can't even tell I've been through all of this,\" she says, \"except for the scars.\"\n\nRELATED: 15 Thyroid Cancer Facts Everyone Should Know\n\nSo when should you get a lingering cough checked out? \"To be safe, I would say that any cough that you're concerned about that's persisting beyond a few weeks, you should talk with your doctor,\" says Dr. McKee. \"A cough shouldn't linger beyond two or three weeks.\"\n\nIf you suspect something is not right with your health, follow up, urges Rivas. \"You know your body better than anybody,\" she says. \"Push, because you're probably right. My pulmonologist told me that if I hadn't caught [my cancer] when I did, I would've died. And it was because of my persistence. I knew something was wrong, I kept pushing.\"\n\nTo learn more lung cancer, check out the American Lung Association's Lung Force campaign.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Health.com.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.419766426086429, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 770, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.71044433838, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 5, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161201140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.8181818181818201, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/24/displaced-iraqis-return-home-for-wartime-christmas-mass.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [74]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 860, "scraper_regex": 904}}, "headline": "Displaced Iraqis return home for 'wartime' Christmas mass", "wordcount_as_scraped": 904, "date": "20161224190000", "story_content": "BARTELLA, Iraq \u2013 \u00a0For the 300 Christians who braved rain and wind to attend Christmas's Eve Mass in their hometown, the ceremony evoked both holiday cheer and grim reminders of the war raging around their northern Iraqi town, and the distant prospect of moving back home.\n\nDisplaced when the Islamic State group seized their town, Bartella, in August 2014, the Christians were bused into town from Irbil, capital of the self-ruled Kurdish region where they have lived for more than two years, to attend the lunchtime service in the Assyrian Orthodox church of Mart Shmoni.\n\nTorched by IS militants, church-supervised volunteers recently cleaned it up after government forces retook Bartella as part of an ongoing campaign to liberate the nearby city of Mosul and surrounding areas in Nineveh province. But the church is still missing its icons, electrical wiring hangs perilously from its ceiling and most light fixtures are gone. The headless statue of a late patriarch stands in the front yard, its pedestal surrounded by shards of glass.\n\nOn Saturday, women joyously ululated when they stepped into the marble-walled church. Almost everyone held a lit candle. Many took photos with their mobile phones. A handful of gas heaters were brought in, but they did little to warm the place on a wet and windy December day.\n\nFor many of them, the sight of their hometown in almost complete ruin was shocking. Only a few homes in the once vibrant town of some 25,000 people stand unscathed. Most have been damaged by shelling or blackened by fire.\n\nOn one street wall, IS's black banner remains visible under the white paint. Next to it, someone wrote: \"Christ is the light of the world. Bartella is Christian.\"\n\n\"Our joy is bigger than our sadness,\" said university student Nevine Ibrahim, 20, who was in Bartella Saturday for the first time since she, her parents and four siblings left in 2014. They found their house badly damaged. Everything they owned was gone.\n\n\"I don't think we can return. The house can be fixed but the pain inside us cannot,\" she said, seated among three of her siblings. \"Who will protect us?\"\n\nHalfway through the service, conducted in Assyrian and Arabic, it became something of a wartime mass. Roughly a dozen U.S. military servicemen and a 100-man contingent from the Iraqi military led by several top generals descended on the church in a show of solidarity.\n\nUnlike their Americans counterparts, the Iraqi troops came armed. Iraqi soldiers \u2014 with one wearing a skull-face balaclava \u2014 searched people coming into the church. Inside, soldiers frisked anyone moving close to the Iraqi generals, who arrived in some two dozen armored SUVs and Humvees.\n\nThe distant thud of explosions could be heard after mass. But none of that seemed to dampen the worshippers' joyous spirit.\n\nThe soldiers photographed each other and took selfies. Many of them held lit candles, and the congregation warmly applauded when Bishop Mussa Al-Shamani thanked the Iraqi military for \"liberating\" Bartella.\n\nThe Christians of Nineveh are members of an ancient and once-vibrant community. They enjoyed protection under Saddam Hussein, but their numbers rapidly dwindled after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq toppled the regime of the late dictator in 2003.\n\nSince 2003, Sunni militants have targeted Christians and their churches, terrorizing the community and forcing many of its members to flee to the West, neighboring nations or the northern Kurdish region. IS's onslaught across northern Iraq in 2014 devastated the unique communities of Christian-majority towns like Karamlis, Bartella and Qaraqosh \u2014 all in the Nineveh plains. Of the estimated 1.5 million Christians who lived in Iraq on the eve of the U.S.-led invasion, about 500,000 are left.\n\n\"This is the mass of defiance,\" Assyrian priest Yacoub Saady told the congregation at the end of the service. \"We, the Christians, are the oldest component of this country. We are staying put and no power can force us to leave.\"\n\nHis words, however, were more hopeful than realistic. The Bartella Christians attending Saturday's Christmas Mass spoke of the community's woes and their slim hopes of returning home.\n\nWith the central Baghdad government strapped for cash because of low oil prices and the spiraling cost of the war against IS, it is unlikely that monetary compensation will be dispensed to residents who lost their homes, or that large scale reconstruction will be undertaken in Bartella anytime soon.\n\nResidents also have deep security concerns, arising mostly from the Iraqi military and security forces' meltdown in the face of IS's blitz across northern and western Iraq in the summer of 2014.\n\n\"People must first be compensated and services like water and electricity restored before they come back to live here,\" said Ramsen Matti, a 28-year-old accountant who now lives in Irbil with his wife and their only child, a daughter born in Bartella less than two months before they fled the town.\n\nAltar boy Masar Jalal arrived with his father on Saturday, the 16-year-old's first visit to Bartella since he fled with his family to Irbil in 2014.\n\n\"I cried for what has become of the town,\" said Jalal. \"I will only come back to live here if there is security.\"\n\nHe found some of his old clothes when he visited the family home, but the furniture was gone. \"The clothes I found are too small for me now, but I also found a mug with my photo that a cousin of mine snapped. No one took that.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.28452754020691, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 860, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.11222595793, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 7, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161224190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.37209302325581, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/26/fleeing-war-south-sudanese-create-booming-camps-in-uganda.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [83]}}, "headline": "Fleeing war, South Sudanese create booming camps in Uganda", "wordcount_as_scraped": 616, "date": "20161226090000", "story_content": "BIDI BIDI CAMP, Uganda \u2013 \u00a0\"I don't want to go back,\" James Issac declared, just minutes after becoming a refugee. \"I don't want to die.\"\n\nFor two days, the slender 30-year-old from South Sudan's Equatoria region navigated his way out of civil war, riding a motorcycle along dirt roads and avoiding government soldiers who, according to accounts by refugees to The Associated Press, have taken aim at civilians.\n\nIn his last steps on South Sudanese soil, Issac passed a group of rag-tag rebel soldiers and crossed a rickety bridge into Uganda, and safety.\n\n\"I am happy,\" he said, as Ugandan soldiers searched his belongings for contraband. \"There (are) no problems here.\"\n\nHe is one of 440,000 refugees who have fled South Sudan's spiraling conflict into Uganda this year alone, creating some of the world's largest refugee camps in just six months' time.\n\nMore than one million refugees have fled South Sudan, spilling across borders in East Africa as the international community warns that the conflict and its ethnic violence could destabilize the region.\n\nSince fighting erupted in South Sudan's capital, Juba, in July and left a peace agreement in tatters, the world's youngest country has experienced ethnic cleansing and teeters on the brink of genocide, according to the United Nations.\n\nThose fleeing have turned Uganda's northwest from an empty bushland into a sprawling complex of refugee settlements. The largest, Bidi Bidi, is a pop-up city that holds roughly 260,000 people weary of war. Last week the U.N. announced the Bidi Bidi camp had stopped taking new arrivals because it was full, and it directed South Sudanese to nearby locations.\n\nThe refugees \"were in critical condition. Bullets remaining in their legs. Others had come with parts amputated. Others were severely bleeding,\" recalled Rufaaaya Asiyati, a nutrition specialist working at the border crossing for the Ugandan government. Roughly 20 percent of those under 5 years old are severely malnourished, she said. Most of the refugees are women and children.\n\nWhen the refugees arrive in settlements set up by the U.N, some like 18-year-old Harriet Guo are alone and must fend for themselves. The refugees are given supplies to build shelters and must set them up themselves.\n\nLike others in the camp, Guo tells stories of brutal violence that forced her to flee South Sudan.\n\n\"There is war there, and here there is peace,\" she said.\n\nMany of the refugees come from Yei, where the AP visited in November and heard stories of government soldiers killing, raping and arresting civilians based on their ethnicity. Some civilians also said that rebel soldiers would take money or phones from people fleeing to Uganda.\n\n\"There are so many people who are shot dead by unknown gunmen, and when you are arrested by armed personnel your whereabouts cannot be found,\" said Taban Jackson, a community leader in the Bidi Bidi camp and a former municipal official in Yei.\n\nUnlike other counties in the region, Uganda has embraced the refugees, according to Charlie Yaxley, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency.\n\n\"Many Ugandans themselves have previously been refugees, and you typically hear expressions of solidarity from the Ugandan people,\" Yaxley said.\n\nMaliki Drakuma is one of them. The town clerk of the local Yumbe government and the owner of a mobile phone store near the refugee settlements, he said the sudden influx of South Sudanese has brought economic development to the barren region.\n\nHe acknowledged that some services have been stressed by the sudden flow of refugees, and police now carry out more patrols.\n\nBut Drakuma compared the nearby border to a \"two-way street\" because he and many other Ugandans had been refugees themselves.\n\n\"We would love the refugees to stay for longer,\" he said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -10.015174865722699, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 594, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 9, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.76339711883, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161226090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.7037037037037, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/10/police-reports-2-students-in-headscarves-assaulted-in-us.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [79]}}, "headline": "Police: reports of 2 students in headscarves assaulted in US", "wordcount_as_scraped": 520, "date": "20161110210000", "story_content": "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2013 \u00a0Two female students in traditional Muslim headscarves have reported being assaulted on or near college campuses in Louisiana and California within hours of Donald Trump's presidential victory, authorities said Thursday.\n\nA college student in Lafayette, Louisiana, told police that two men \u2014 one wearing a white \"Trump\" hat \u2014 shouted racial obscenities as they beat her and stole her wallet and headscarf, known as a hijab.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities at San Diego State University said two suspects who assaulted a Muslim student on campus Wednesday had targeted her because of her faith and made comments about Trump's election.\n\nThe 18-year-old student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette said she was walking near the campus Wednesday morning when she was accosted by two white men who drove up in a gray sedan, Lafayette police said in a statement. The student said the men struck her several times in the back with a metal object, knocking her down, according to police.\n\nPolice haven't identified any suspects. The student declined medical treatment.\n\nLafayette Police Department spokesman Cpl. Karl Ratcliff said investigators haven't found any witnesses or surveillance video to assist them. \"Basically, all we have is her statement,\" Ratcliff said. \"At this point, there's not really much else we can do with it.\"\n\nSan Diego State University police said Thursday they are investigating the attack on its campus as a hate crime. The woman was not hurt. Authorities said the assault occurred in a parking complex while the woman was wearing a hijab. The suspects stole her car keys, and the vehicle was later reported missing, authorities said.\n\nIn a statement, SDSU President Elliot Hirshman denounced the attack, calling hate crimes destructive to the spirit of the campus.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Kamala Harris on Thursday issued an information bulletin to law enforcement agencies, outlining laws that prohibit hate crimes.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties of Louisiana said it was outraged and troubled by the Lafayette student's report.\n\n\"We call on all Louisianians to reject anti-Muslim bigotry,\" the group said in a statement. \"Muslim Americans and residents have the same rights that we all do: to practice our religion freely and openly, to live and work without fear, and to participate equally in public life.\"\n\nThe university's police department issued a statement notifying staff and students about the student's reported attack. In a separate statement that didn't mention the incident, university president E. Joseph Savoie called for unity after a \"long, contentious presidential campaign.\"\n\n\"With the election behind us, we must now concentrate on trying to find common ground that will enable us to move forward \u2014 together \u2014 as a nation,\" Savoie said.\n\nKareem Attia, a 23-year-old graduate student who is president of the university's Muslim Student Association, said he didn't want to jump to any conclusions about whether the election results inspired the alleged attack.\n\n\"I don't think that's proper,\" he said. \"But I will say a hate crime is a hate crime. It's not within our religion to accept it. It's not within our species of humans to accept that, either.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.07638883590698, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 528, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.34021328561, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161110210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.11363636363636, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/21/some-in-media-dig-in-against-normalizing-donald-trump.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [6770, 7006]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1025, "scraper_regex": 1145}}, "headline": "Some in the media dig in against 'normalizing' Donald Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1145, "date": "20161121110000", "story_content": "This is not normal.\n\nMany in the media, mostly on the liberal side, have come up with a verb that captures their disgust at the man who will be America's 45th president.\n\nIt's a word that clearly signals that they will remain in opposition, in a state of perpetual outrage, that, in truth, they don't fully accept the results of the election.\n\nDonald Trump, they say, should not be normalized.\n\nTo be \"normalized\" would be to be treated as just another president-elect putting together his Cabinet and White House staff. A normalized process would involve skeptical coverage, aggressive coverage, but would fit within the template of previous transitions.\n\nWhat those who decry the normalization of Barack Obama's successor are really saying is Trump is not a legitimate president, and doesn't deserve to be treated as such.\n\nAnd the reason I find this troubling is that there's an echo of what some opponents did to the nation's first black president. He was unfit, he wasn't legitimate, he was a Muslim, he wasn't born here, and we had to \"take back our country\"\u2014that became a very common rallying cry.\n\nBut somehow it's now okay to say that Trump isn't normal?\n\nLook, I get that Trump was part of a divisive and polarizing campaign, and that some Hispanics, blacks, Muslims, women and others felt insulted by his candidacy. No one's saying they suddenly have to love the guy.\n\nBut Trump won the election fair and square, despite his sometimes inflammatory tone. Sixty million Americans voted for him. For those who were angry when Mitch McConnell said his top priority was to defeat Obama, doesn't Trump deserve a shot at a normal presidency? Don't we all have a stake in his success?\n\nThat doesn't mean refraining from criticizing his policies or personnel picks. But does aggressively covering a president in the same fashion as previous presidents really amount to normalizing him? \n\nSlate is a leader in the non-normalization camp:\n\n\"When Donald Trump won the presidency, our vocabularies didn't bulge to accommodate the reality that this ignorant geyser of hate had ascended to the world's yugest leadership position. We're left pressing the same worn-out words into service, paradoxically reminding each other: This is not normal.\n\n\"In an essay for the New York Times Magazine, Teju Cole wrote, of the days following Trump's win, 'All around were the unmistakable signs of normalization in progress. So many were falling into line without being pushed. It was happening at tremendous speed, like a contagion.' David Remnick told CNN, 'We've normalized [the results] already. Less than a week after the election is over, suddenly Washington is going about its business talking about who's going to get what jobs. You would think that Mitt Romney had won. It's a hallucination.'\u2026 'He is not normal,' insisted John Oliver over the weekend. 'He is abnormal.' Shouts of 'normalization' have become normalized.\n\n\"The frame we're putting around the president-elect emphasizes how freakishly outside the mainstream his views and behavior lie. That's useful, up to a point. But in appealing to what's typical rather than what's right or true, we're missing an opportunity to make a stronger statement. Trump himself aims to center white men as 'normal' and push everyone else to the periphery.\"\n\nAh, now we get to the real agenda: It's racial. It's about putting white men back in charge and the hell with everyone else. \n\nSalon is on the same page: \"Oprah Winfrey, in an interview with Entertainment Tonight, said Trump's recent visit to the White House gave her 'hope' and suggested he has been 'humbled' by the experience. The Guardian's Simon Jenkins told his readers to 'calm down' and that Trump wasn't the 'worst thing.' His college, Nouriel Roubini, insisted the Oval Office will 'tame' Trump. People magazine ran a glowing profile of Trump and his wife Melania (though a former People writer accused Trump of sexual assault). \n\nThe New York Times' Nick Kristof dubiously added that we should 'Grit our teeth and give Trump a chance.' The mainstays\u2014Washington Post, New York Times and CNN\u2014while frequently critical, are coving Trump's transition as they would any other. President Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have all issued statements recognizing Trump's legitimacy and pleading we give him a chance.\n\n\"Overall there's a creeping sense that we're stuck with Trump and we should make it 'work' in some type of do-goody liberal appeal to patriotism.\n\n\"But this is wrong, both tactically and ethically. Trump isn't normal and he should never be treated as such, regardless of what President Obama and Clinton and Sanders say.\"\n\n Wow. Even saying give the guy a chance is considered a failure. Who appointed Salon as the arbiter of normality?\n\nThe Boston Globe's Renee Graham views Trump more as a vessel:\n\n\"Ever since the election that shook up the world, one refrain in columns, commentaries, and social media posts has been incessant: 'Now that Donald Trump is the president-elect, we cannot allow him to be normalized.' It's a defiant, noble stance, but it overlooks a very crucial point: Had racism, bigotry, and sexism not been normalized for centuries, Trump would not be weeks away from becoming the 45th president of the United States.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Trump's election is as disastrous as an Old Testament plague. His election has sparked anger and anxiety, driving thousands nationwide into the streets in protest. Between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. last Wednesday, when Trump's victory was inevitable, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline recorded a 250 percent spike in calls. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate crimes, has logged more than 200 reports of harassment and intimidation since Election Day.\"\n\n\nAnd this is Trump's fault? This is the same kind of circular reasoning that tried to blame Ferguson on Obama.\n\nFrom the right, National Review's Jonah Goldberg says it's the mainstream media that normalized Trump during the primaries:\n\n\"Trump was good for ratings ... The mainstream media and numerous liberal pundits loved Trump's impact on the GOP for the same reason bored teenagers like to throw lit matches into dumpsters: Garbage fires are fun to watch. The third reason is closely related to the second: The media thought Trump was more likely lose to Hillary Clinton.\"\n\n\nHow'd that work out for them?\n\nIf Donald Trump, with no political experience, rises to the height of the office and can compromise with competing factions, he will be a successful president. If Trump does not, his administration will fail to live up to his promises. That, to my mind, is a more normal outlook than insisting that the country just elected an abnormal businessman. \u00a0\n\n\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

But that's not how it worked out for one refugee family that came to check out the state of their home: They found another family had moved in.\n\nThat's just one of many hurdles keeping away those displaced in Syria's war.\n\nMany who fled say they fear arrest if they return to homes now under government control or that their sons will be conscripted into the same military that once bombarded their towns. In other former opposition strongholds, the state is carrying out redevelopment projects that have razed thousands of homes.\n\nThe opposition accuses the government of President Bashar Assad of using under-the-radar methods to discourage populations it sees as disloyal from returning, changing the demographics to help consolidate control over a corridor running from Damascus to the Mediterranean coast.\n\nThe government says it is doing all it can to bring people back.\n\n\"The main goal of the Syrian government is to return all displaced Syrians to their homes,\" National Reconciliation Minister Ali Haidar told The Associated Press last month.\n\nMore than 11 million people, nearly half Syria's population, have been driven from their homes by the war since 2011, including 5 million who fled abroad as refugees.\n\nThe war still rages in many parts of the country, and there is heavy destruction. In those conditions, a mass return is unlikely. So it is difficult to measure how much government measures are keeping opposition-minded Syrians from returning.\n\nBut the fall of a number of opposition strongholds in recent months has brought to immediate relevance the issue of who can come back.\n\nFor example, a string of rebel, mainly Sunni Muslim suburbs around Damascus have come under military control. They were drained of much of their population as hundreds of thousands fled siege and bombardment in recent years. Now thousands more are leaving because of government control. It is an open question whether they will ever return.\n\nIn Aleppo, Syria's largest city, government forces are besieging the rebel eastern districts, and the estimated 275,000 residents have refused calls to evacuate, in part because many are convinced they'll never be allowed back.\n\nThe fact that most of the people from rebel areas are Sunni Muslims adds a toxic sectarian aspect to the charges of demographic manipulation. Sunni Muslims are the majority in Syria and make up the backbone of the rebellion, while minorities have largely supported Assad, particularly members of his own Alawite community, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.\n\nHoms, Syria's third largest city, offers an indication of the hurdles for would-be returnees.\n\nIn 2014, Homs' last major rebel neighborhoods, centered in its Old City, surrendered. That came after a long brutal siege that drove an estimated 300,000 from the city.\n\nTwo years later, the government says the Old City is open for residents, but even official statistics say only 40 percent have returned. That figure is impossible to independently confirm, and the opposition believes it is inflated.\n\nOn a visit to the Old City of Homs earlier this year, an AP team found a ghost town.\n\nMore recently, AP interviewed six families expelled from Homs' old quarters, and only one could point to a relative, among hundreds, who has returned. All those interviewed spoke on condition they only be identified by their first names for fear of reprisals by the government.\n\n\"The families of the old city are still in exile. Today, you'll find them all over the world, except in their neighborhoods,\" said Abou Zeid, from the George Chiyah neighborhood.\n\nHoda, now living in the Lebanese city of Tripoli, said she was told she had to pay overdue bills before she could see her Homs home. But she, like others, is deeply hesitant to approach state institutions to do so or validate her property records because it means crossing through multiple checkpoints run by the feared security services.\n\nThe displaced fear security forces will detain their husbands and sons for trumped-up crimes or conscript them into Assad's military.\n\n\"We are not able to go back,\" said Rabaa, who fled to Lebanon with her family in 2012.\n\nShe has a 20-year-old son. \"The first thing they'll do is take him to the military,\" she said. \"Go see our home? No way.\"\n\nFamilies have also found others living in their homes. The extent of such incidents is murky. The displaced say the expropriation is widespread, but their reports cannot be independently confirmed.\n\nA pair of sisters, Maha and Um Alaa, described to the AP how they tried to check on Um Alaa's apartment in the town of Tel Khalakh, a former opposition stronghold 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Homs. The sisters, now in Tripoli, spoke on condition they not be fully identified.\n\nMaha visited and found another family living there, she said. A loud argument ensued, and Maha backed off, fearing that the government would side with the squatter family.\n\nUm Alaa said her neighbors told her the family was from the nearby town of Hosn. Neighbors also said other displaced people had asked authorities in Tel Kalakh for places to live and were directed to houses of those who had fled, Um Alaa said.\n\nThe family in the home could not be reached because the landline has been switched off.\n\nAlso, Um Alaa fears she and her husband won't be able to reclaim their home because they didn't bring their property deed when they fled in 2014. \"We thought we would only be gone a month,\" she said. \"We have nothing to prove it is ours.\"\n\nConscription fears are also driving residents out of former opposition strongholds.\n\nThe government denies that conscription is a tactic to push dissidents out, saying it a national duty.\n\n\"It's a law that dates back to the establishment of the Syrian state,\" said Haidar, the national reconciliation minister.\n\nHe said the military is exploring ways around the predicament. For example, in some recaptured areas, the government has offered to postpone conscripts' deployments for six months to a year.\n\nBut many deserters and draft-dodgers view this as simply a government tactic to give them a deadline to leave.\n\n\"The implication is that ... in these six months you get everything in order and flee, (and the military) will look the other way,\" said Dani Qappani, an opposition activist.\n\nIn the Damascus suburb of Moadamiyeh, for example, a third of the population of 50,000 fled during the government siege. After the suburb surrendered in September, some 10,000 more are likely to leave over the coming months for fear of conscription, said Bassma Kodmani, an opposition official.\n\nSimilarly, some 13,000 will probably leave the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya along with their families to avoid conscription, said a former fighter in Qudsaya.\n\nThe fighter, who is wanted for military service, said he approached authorities for the 6-month grace period and received it. He said that gives him time to sell his home and belongings before moving with his wife and two children to the northwest province of Idlib, the main rebel-held territory. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he has not yet left the government-held area.\n\nWhen the suburb of Daraya fell in August, all its last remaining residents \u2014 around 2,700 from an original 250,00 \u2014 were removed and put in camps, raising an outcry from U.N. officials over the possibility of a forced displacement. The government says they will eventually be allowed back.\n\nBut Daraya could see the sort of urban renewal projects that observers say are also a tool for demographic engineering.\n\nA 2014 report by Human Rights Watch identified seven opposition neighborhoods around the country razed by government authorities for \"redevelopment.\" It accused authorities of carrying out collective punishment.\n\nPresidential Decree 66, issued in 2012, lists a number of areas, mostly opposition, for urban renewal projects involving demolishing shantytowns.\n\n\"It serves another purpose: to punish the unruly areas, so you pacify them, and you change the demographic,\" said Rashad al-Kattan, a political analyst affiliated with the Center for Syrian Studies at the University of St. Andrews, in Scotland.\n\nIn March, Assad lay the cornerstone for one such renovation project, in Damascus' working-class Kafr Sousa and Basateen al-Razeh neighborhoods. The project is to build orderly new residential towers. But opposition outlets say residents are being pushed out. The Human Rights Watch report said up to 3,000 residential buildings had been demolished.\n\nDecree 66 also authorizes similar projects for Daraya, according to the pro-government business journal Iqtisad.\n\nDaraya and the other Sunni suburbs are highly strategic, said Kodmani, with the opposition's High Negotiations Committee.\n\n\"If Damascus is to be really safe over the longer term, any pockets around Damascus need to be made loyal.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 8, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.29095697402954, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1393, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.54768956451, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 51, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161106100000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.63636363636, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6611629576453706, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/26/pipeline-protesters-vow-to-stay-camped-on-federal-land.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [74]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 759, "scraper_regex": 800}}, "headline": "Pipeline protesters vow to stay camped on federal land", "wordcount_as_scraped": 800, "date": "20161127010000", "story_content": "CANNON BALL, N.D. \u2013 \u00a0Dakota Access oil pipeline protesters will not follow a government directive to leave the federal land where hundreds have camped for months, organizers said Saturday, despite state officials encouraging them to do so.\n\nStanding Rock Sioux tribal leader Dave Archambault and other protest organizers confidently explained that they'll stay at the Oceti Sakowin camp and continue with nonviolent protests a day after Archambault received a letter from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that said all federal lands north of the Cannonball River will be closed to public access Dec. 5 for \"safety concerns.\"\n\nThe Corps cited the oncoming winter and increasingly contentious clashes between protesters, who believe the pipeline could harm drinking water and Native American cultural sites, and police.\n Standing Rock tribal members believe the land in which the encampment is on is owned by the Sioux through a more than century-old treaty with the U.S. government.\n\nVETERANS TO STAND WITH STANDING ROCK PROTESTERS\n\n\"We are wardens of this land. This is our land and they can't remove us,\" said protester Isaac Weston, who is an Oglala Sioux member from South Dakota. \"We have every right to be here to protect our land and to protect our water.\"\n\nThe vast majority of the several hundred people fighting against the four-state, $3.8 billion pipeline have created a self-sustaining community at the sprawling camp, which is on Corps land in southern North Dakota, and have put up semi-permanent structures or brought motor homes and trailers in advance of the harsh winter.\n\nOn the unseasonably warm Saturday, people were chopping wood and setting up tents at the encampment, which is more than a mile from a Missouri River reservoir where the final large segment of the pipeline is yet to be completed due to the Corps consulting with the tribe. Authorities had set up a staging area about a mile away on a hill overlooking the site.\n\nDallas Goldtooth, a protest organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, said it is \"an atrocious example that colonization has not ended for us here as indigenous people,\" and that the government's request will escalate already rocky tensions.\n\nSTANDING ROCK CHAIRMAN SAYS ARMY CORE TO CLOSE CAMP ACCESS\n\nRepresentatives from the Army Corps of Engineers didn't immediately return multiple messages Friday or Saturday seeking comment and verification of the letter. Last month, the Corps said it would not evict the encampment, which started as overflow from smaller private and permitted protest sites nearby and began growing in August.\n\nPresident Barack Obama raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline in that area earlier this month, something Kelcy Warren, CEO of Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners, told The Associated Press is not an option from the company's standpoint. Obama said his administration is monitoring the \"challenging situation\" but would \"let it play out for several more weeks.\"\n\nSome of the protests have resulted in violent confrontations \u2014 one woman suffered a serious arm injury last weekend \u2014 and more than 500 people have been arrested since August.\n\nThe Corps' letter, according to Archambault, said that those who stay on the land after Dec. 5 may be prosecuted, and that there'll be a free speech zone south of the river.\n\nArchambault said Saturday that he doesn't believe the Corps will forcibly evict people from the camp, adding that the tribe is working to provide protesters protection from the elements on its reservation, which is south of the Cannonball River, but offered few details.\n\nIt's the federal government's job to peacefully close the camp because it allowed people to stay there in the first place, Gov. Jack Dalrymple said in a statement Saturday.\n\n\"Our state and local law enforcement agencies continue to do all they can to keep private property and public infrastructure free from unpermitted protest activities, and its past time that the federal government provides the law enforcement resources ... to enforce their own order to vacate,\" the Republican said.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Morton County Commission chairman Cody Schulz, who said county and state leaders have been seeking federal law enforcement help for months. \"It's now time for the federal government to live up to its obligations\" said Schulz.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven and Democratic U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp said the protesters need to move for public safety.\n\n\"The well-being and property of ranchers, farmers and everyone else living in the region should not be threatened by protesters who are willing to commit acts of violence,\" Hoeven said in a statement Friday. He also called on the Obama administration to let work on the pipeline move forward, saying, \"this difficult situation has gone on too long and we need to get it resolved.\"\n\nHeitkamp said the Corps' order is \"a needed step to support the safety of residents, workers, protesters and law enforcement.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.4772181510925297, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 759, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.2218263902999995, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161127010000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.95256916996047, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/10/trump-future-national-security-adviser-stresses-continuity.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [73]}}, "headline": "Trump's future national security adviser stresses continuity", "wordcount_as_scraped": 710, "date": "20170110220000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0President-elect Donald Trump's future national security adviser said Tuesday he would press on with President Barack Obama's changes to the National Security Council, suggesting no wholesale fix is in store for the body of foreign policy professionals who often provide the last word before the commander in chief's decisions.\n\nAt a conference focused on national security and the presidential transition, retired Gen. Michael Flynn sought to stress continuity in America's national security structure after an election dominated by Trump's calls for a rupture in much of Washington's agenda in international affairs. Flynn spoke of \"working toward a common national security goal,\" free from partisan wrangling.\n\nBut the challenge of transforming Trump's promises into bipartisan policy was underscored at the same event by Secretary of State John Kerry, who warned of the rise of a \"factless political environment\" in which policy is made on Twitter and said Trump's \"America First\" policy could lead to a U.S. retreat from the world. Kerry was followed by National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who highlighted the dangers Russia and North Korea pose to the United States no matter which party holds the presidency.\n\nFlynn called his future job, which doesn't require Senate confirmation, \"an awesome responsibility\" that \"gets to the pure essence of protecting the American people, our homeland and our Constitution.\"\n\nAfter Rice stressed that Trump and future presidents should be able to staff the NSC as they wish, Flynn said Trump's incoming team was \"committed to carrying out the necessary reforms begun by previous administrations.\"\n\nThe transition team has been considering ways to restructure intelligence agencies to streamline operations and improve efficiency. It is looking at changes at both the Director of National Intelligence's office and the CIA, according to a person familiar with the plan who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. Less clear is if any redesign is in store for the NSC, which recent presidents increasingly have leaned on but which critics have seen as a bloated agency that takes away from established bodies like the Pentagon and the State Department.\n\nRice said staff had been reduced 15 percent during her tenure. \"The issue is not mainly about the size of the NSC, it's about the role of the NSC,\" she said.\n\nRice promised to help Flynn despite her administration's \"profound disagreements with the next one.\"\n\nBut Kerry lamented his lack of contact with Trump's new team.\n\nOn the State Department's transition, Kerry half-jokingly said it was going \"pretty smoothly\" because \"there is not an enormous amount of it.\"\n\nHe said he had yet to meet Trump's choice to replace him as America's top diplomat, Exxon Mobil chief Rex Tillerson, though he expects to do so \"in the near term\" and still believes there is time for \"an ample debriefing\" before the new administration begins.\n\nRejecting criticism that Obama had failed to lead in dealing with world crises, Kerry said \"we've been leading\" and pointed to the Iran nuclear deal, Paris climate change agreement, response to the Ebola virus, strengthening NATO and his own unsuccessful efforts to end Syria's civil war. He said charges that the administration mishandled the Arab Spring revolts against authoritarian leaders were wrong.\n\nWith only 10 days left in his tenure, Kerry called for a new \"Marshall Plan\" to help countries in critical regions around the world educate their exploding youth populations and prevent them from being radicalized.\n\nLack of education and the spread of misinformation, notably online, are serious threats that must be confronted to prevent a rise of \"authoritarian populism\" that threatens the international order, Kerry said. He accused Russia of mounting a \"''horrendous invasion of our democratic process\" by interfering in the 2016 presidential election and said such actions must be combatted.\n\n\"One of the greatest challenges we all face right now, not just America but every country, is that we are living in a factless political environment,\" Kerry said.\n\nHe did not mention Trump by name but took a thinly veiled shot at the president-elect's propensity to tweet his views on policy issues.\n\n\"If policy is going to be made in 140 characters on Twitter and every reasonable measure of accountability is being bypassed and people don't care about it, we have a problem,\" Kerry said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.9023747444152797, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 694, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.8633689747, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.322766570605189, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/17/dems-media-skewing-trumps-record-on-lgbt-issues.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2670, 2736, 3160, 4276]}}, "headline": "Dems, media skewing Trump's record on LGBT issues?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 697, "date": "20161117100000", "story_content": "Months after businessman Peter Thiel made history as the first openly gay speaker to address his sexuality from a Republican convention podium, and mere hours after it emerged President-elect Donald Trump was considering an openly gay man for U.N. ambassador, the leader of a prominent gay conservatives group was still fielding calls from worried members of the LGBT community.\n\n\"Please tell me we don't have anything to fear,\" callers continually asked Log Cabin Republicans leader Gregory Angelo.\n\nGiven the media coverage that's greeted Trump's victory a week ago, it's not too difficult to see where the worries originate: The New York Times wrote about the billionaire's election as \"a devastating loss\" for the gay community; Mother Jones ran a piece on rising calls to LGBT suicide prevention hotlines; Senate Minority Leader Democrat Harry Reid issued a statement Friday citing accounts of \"gay and lesbian couples having slurs hurled at them and feeling afraid to walk down the street holding hands.\"\n\nBut gay conservative leaders like Angelo suggest that level of alarm doesn't seem to square with the rhetoric and actions emanating from Trump and his campaign.\n\nBARRON: TRUMP WILL BE FRIEND, ADVOCATE FOR LGBT COMMUNITY\n\nAside from Thiel's well-received convention speech, the Silicon Valley billionaire was named to the executive committee of Trump's presidential transition team. Ric Grenell, a former diplomat and a Fox News contributor, reportedly is on the short list to be U.S. ambassador to the U.N. \u2013 which would make him the first openly gay person to serve in that role.\n\nTrump said in April that transgender individuals should \"use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate,\" and he counts transgender celeb Caitlyn Jenner as a supporter. In a \"60 Minutes\" interview Sunday, Trump declared the issue of marriage equality to be \"settled.\"\n\n\"These do not sound like the words of someone who the LGBTQ community should be fearful of,\" Angelo told FoxNews.com. \"I don't believe we've ever had a president who has so explicitly made overtures to the LGBTQ community. That's unprecedented.\"\n\nOne of Trump's most noteworthy outreach efforts came July 21 at the Republican National Convention, in the aftermath of the June terrorist attack on Florida gay nightclub Pulse. Delivering his nomination acceptance speech, Trump assured those listening, \"As your president I will do everything in my power to protect LGBTQ citizens.\"\n\nThe convention crowd cheered at the line, prompting Trump to deliver an off-script aside: \"I must say, as a Republican it's so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said.\"\u00a0\n\nSuch remarks were a break from traditional Republican rhetoric.\u00a0\n\n\"Donald Trump won, not because he campaigned on social issues, but essentially because he campaigned on everything but social issues,\" Angelo said. \"Gone are the days where an exclusive focus on social issues is the crown jewel of a Republican presidential campaign.\"\n\nCritics \u2013 and even those willing to give Trump a chance, like Angelo \u2013 do have lingering gripes with Trump and his party, however, on gay rights issues.\u00a0\n\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, who's expected to wield a great deal of power and currently is leading the transition team, has long been a target of LGBT activists. As Indiana governor, Pence signed a religious freedom law that was strongly opposed by the LGBT community, and it was only after significant criticism that Pence signed an amendment to protect gays and lesbians. Pence has previously supported a constitutional amendment to define marriage as being between a man and a woman, opposed an employment non-discrimination act, opposed the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" and has stood against allowing transgender individuals to use the bathroom of the gender they associate with.\n\nThe official platform of Trump's party, too, is opposed to same-sex marriage and transgender bathroom laws.\n\nBut despite the sometimes conflicting agendas, Angelo sees opportunity.\n\n\"What you're seeing, if you look big picture, is an effort to bring together not just wings of the GOP, but parts of America that were traditionally viewed as incompatible,\" Angelo said. \"That's something that makes me very optimistic.\"\u00a0\n\nBefore the election, Grenell wrote in The Washington Times: \"No other Republican Presidential nominee in history has embraced the LGBT community in such a loud and proud way.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.0, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 683, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.49261322042, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161117100000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.66032210834553, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/20/defeated-gambian-president-agrees-to-step-aside-official-says.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [79]}}, "headline": "Defeated Gambian president agrees to step aside, official says", "wordcount_as_scraped": 698, "date": "20170120210000", "story_content": "BANJUL, Gambia \u2013 \u00a0Longtime Gambian leader Yahya Jammeh agreed Friday to yield power to the man who defeated him in last month's presidential election, a Senegalese government official said.\n\n\nJammeh had refused to accept the results of the election he lost to Adama Barrow, who was inaugurated Thursday at Gambia's embassy in neighboring Senegal. The leaders of Guinea and Mauritania met with Jammeh on Friday to try to persuade him to step down.\n\n\nThe Senegalese government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to talk to reporters, said final arrangements to the agreement with Jammeh were still being worked out.\n\n\n\"The rule of fear has been vanished from the Gambia for good,\" Barrow told members of the diaspora in Senegal's capital late Friday.\n\n\nJammeh, who first seized power in a 1994 coup, has offered to step aside once before during the current crisis -- only to change his mind later.\n\n\nHe has been holed up in his official residence in the capital, Banjul, and was becoming increasingly isolated as his security forces abandoned him and he dissolved his Cabinet.\n\n\nA West African regional military force was poised to move against Jammeh if he refused to step down.\n\n\nDefense forces chief Ousmane Badjie told The Associated Press that Gambia's security services all support Barrow and would not oppose the regional force.\n\n\n\"You cannot push us to war for an issue we can solve politically,\" Badjie said. \"We don't see any reason to fight.\"\n\n\nThe force, including tanks, rolled into Gambia without facing any resistance, said Marcel Alain de Souza, chairman of the West African regional bloc, ECOWAS. At least 20 military vehicles were seen Friday at the border town of Karang.\n\n\nThe force included troops from Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, Togo and Mali, and they moved in after Barrow's inauguration and a unanimous vote by the U.N. Security Council to support the regional efforts.\n\n\nJammeh met Friday with Guinean President Alpha Conde and President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz of Mauritania, which has been mentioned as a possible home in exile for Jammeh. After a first round of talks, they broke for Friday prayers and resumed.\n\n\nJammeh \"has the choice of going with President Alpha Conde,\" de Souza said, but if that fails, \"we will bring him by force or by will.\"\n\n\nJammeh had agreed to step down but demanded amnesty for any crimes he may have committed during his 22 years in power and wanted to stay in Gambia, in his home village of Kanilai, de Souza said. Those demands were not acceptable to ECOWAS, he added.\n\n\nIn his inaugural speech, which took place under heavy security, Barrow urged Jammeh to respect the will of the people and step aside. He also called for Gambia's armed forces to stay in their barracks.\n\n\nSome of Gambia's diplomatic missions began switching their allegiance.\n\n\n\"We embrace and support the new president Adama Barrow,\" said Almamy Kassama, an official at the Gambian mission to the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in an email.\n\n\nSenegalese radio station RFM reported 30 Gambian soldiers had crossed into Senegal to fight alongside the regional forces.\n\n\n\"I think the Gambian military would know it's outnumbered,\" said Maggie Dwyer, an expert on West African armed forces at the University of Edinburgh. \"Gambia's military has very little combat experience. This would be a very difficult situation for them.\"\n\n\nShe estimated it had 2,400 troops at most, plus fewer than 1,000 paramilitary forces.\n\n\n\"My guess is a very small number would actually put their life on the line for Jammeh,\" though some could stand by him to get the same deal he might receive to avoid prosecution, Dwyer said.\n\n\nSoldiers at checkpoints in Banjul appeared relaxed, with one telling visitors, \"Welcome to the smiling coast.\"\n\n\nAfrican nations including South Africa continued stepping away from Jammeh, with the African Union saying the continental body no longer recognizes him.\n\n\nAbout 45,000 people have fled Gambia for Senegal, fearing violence, according to the Senegalese government and the U.N. refugee agency.

It is the country's largest city and its former commercial capital and represents a major prize for any side that can claim control over it after more than five years of war. The rebels control the city's eastern districts, which have been besieged by pro-government forces since July.\n\nSocial media accounts linked to the rebels carried photos and footage purporting to show the factions targeting government positions with artillery, tank and rocket fire. Rebels detonated an explosives-laden vehicle in a suicide operation targeting the government-held New Aleppo district, according to the al-Qaida-linked Fatah al-Sham Front, which circulated footage of the blast on its social media accounts.\n\nThe Nour el-Din el-Zinki movement said rebels detonated two other vehicle bombs, as well, including one on the military's academy in the west.\n\nAhrar al-Sham, another rebel group, said they had advanced into a western, government-held neighborhood known as the 3000 Apartments complex, a claim that could not be independently verified.\n\nSyrian state media said 12 civilians were killed by rebel fire and eight others hospitalized with breathing difficulties when rebels targeted several government-controlled neighborhoods with poison gas. The claim could not be independently verified.\n\nThe attacks came as a Russian lawmaker pledged that Russian and Syrian government forces would \"purge\" the city if rebels do not leave its eastern neighborhoods by the end of the \"humanitarian pause\" in fighting due to take place between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Friday.\n\nEarlier this week, the Russian and Syrian militaries promised a pause in fighting and to open humanitarian corridors out of eastern Aleppo. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged rebels to use the passages to leave the city.\n\nSenator Frants Klintsevich, who carries little political weight, told the Interfax news agencies on Thursday that a \"purge will begin\" if \"there are no results\" once the pause ends. He added, however, that saving civilians is the main priority.\n\nOther Russian officials have not indicated what they intend to do when the pause ends. Russia recently dispatched aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, which is now in the Mediterranean and heading for the Syrian coast. Its presence suggests that Russia may be intending to escalate its assault on rebel-held parts of the northern Syrian city.\n\nMeanwhile, tension between two of the largest rebel factions in Aleppo continued Thursday, a day after clashes between the two groups broke out. The development bodes ill for the rebels' ability to battle pro-government forces, although Yasser al-Yousef of Nour el-Din el-Zinki group said his faction and the Fastaqim group had agreed to arbitration on Thursday.\n\nHowever, in a sign of continued tensions, fighters aligned with the hard-line Conquest Army opposition coalition, which includes the el-Zinki faction, seized the headquarters and warehouses of the more moderate Fastaqim group, according to a media official for Fastaqim.\n\nThe U.N. estimates 275,000 people, the vast majority civilians, are trapped inside rebel-held eastern Aleppo with dwindling food and supplies. U.N. officials have condemned the tactic, employed primarily by the government across the country, as \"medieval,\" ''barbaric,\" and in contravention to international law.\n\nThe U.N. says more than one million people are residing in the government-controlled west.

It blamed the strike on Russian aircraft.

But why go year-to-year? If you'd prefer to have not just a better year \u2014 but better decades \u2014 I suggest taking a good look in the mirror and making a New Year's resolution to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Here are 7 Deadly Habits and what to do about them in the year \u2014 and decades \u2014 to come:\n\n1.\u00a0 Quit smoking. And quit e-cigs, too.\n\nSmoking is the No 1. cause of preventable death in the U.S., and while electronic cigarettes are touted as a safe alternative, they contain nicotine and nearly 29 other known carcinogens that are released when they are ignited. It's no wonder the surgeon general has declared them to be a significant public health risk. Traditional cigarettes are associated with lung cancer, heart disease and lung disease, among numerous other ailments, but your lung tissue can heal and your lungs can slowly return to normal function if you quit smoking. Quitting can reduce your risk of heart disease, too \u2014 even if you have smoked for decades. The best way to quit is to set a quit date and stick to it. Ask for support from friends and family, and avoid situations that you associate with smoking. There are many drug and behavioral therapies available to help you quit, so ask your doctor for help, too.\n\n2.\u00a0 Quit mindless eating and fast food.\n\nObesity and obesity-related illnesses cost our health care system nearly $150 billion last year. Obesity leads to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Nearly 1 in 3 Americans, including children, are obese \u2014 and if we do not make a change soon, it is estimated that half of us will be considered obese by 2030. Solving the epidemic is dependent upon many factors, the biggest of which is diet. Eating wholesome, nutrient-rich foods is the single most important thing we can do to help control our weight, but it is imperative to take note of not only what we eat, but how and when we eat. Mindless eating \u2014 such as routine snacking on chips while watching TV \u2014 quickly leads to obesity and sets a poor example for our children. Convenience foods, such as fast foods and frozen dinners, are calorie-dense and loaded with sodium and preservatives. Rather than consume thousands of needless calories and tons of extra fat, prepare healthy meals on the weekends that can become quick family dinners after a long and busy day of work or school.\n\n3.\u00a0 Turn off that screen.\n\nRather than have real conversations during family outings, many of us are individually engaged in online activities. Electronic devices consume an enormous amount of our free time, and screen obsession has resulted in a generation of young Americans who have lost the art of conversation. While mobile devices and tablets can be wonderful teaching tools, it is important that young children engage in real world activities with adults and children of similar age. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting young children's screen time to less than two hours a day. As for older kids, excessive online activity has been linked to cyberbullying and social isolation, leading many teens to develop depression and other mental health disorders. Time spent on devices indoors also reduces physical activity, which contributes to the obesity epidemic. Exposure to screens late in the evening can lead to sleep disturbances and can disrupt your circadian rhythms, leading to daytime fatigue and diminished productivity.\n\n4.\u00a0 Go to sleep.\n\nOur cells repair themselves and new neuronal connections develop in our brain, improving cognition and productivity, when we're asleep. According to multiple studies, the average adult needs approximately 7.5 hours of sleep per night to optimize performance. (Children need more and the elderly tend to need a little less.) Some studies have shown that adequate sleep can prolong life: In 2010, research showed that women who got less than 5.5 hours of sleep had shorter life spans than those who got 6.5 hours or more. Getting adequate sleep has also been found to improve memory. Sleep deprivation can lead to decreased performance at school and at work, and daytime drowsiness can result in accidents and injuries. Good sleep comes from good sleep \"hygiene\": Don't eat within two hours of bedtime; limit alcohol; limit screen time; use the bedroom only for sleep and intimacy; and follow a routine. Set a bedtime \u2014 for kids and adults \u2014 and stick to it. Wind down before going to sleep, and be consistent.\n\n5.\u00a0 Burn the candle at one end, not two.\n\nForty-three percent of Americans suffer negative health consequences due to stress, which can lead to headaches, upset stomach, elevated blood pressure, chest pain and sleep problems. Our bodies release hormones, including cortisol, adrenaline and epinephrine, in stressful situations that can increase our heart rate, strain our cardiovascular system, raise our blood pressure, limit performance and impair our ability to think clearly. While the \"fight or flight\" response is essential in life-threatening situations, it is not necessarily good to experience it daily. If we can learn better coping mechanisms and reduce stress, we will likely be far more effective in our daily lives.\n\n6.\u00a0 Get off the couch.\n\nThousands of people die every year due to physical inactivity, which tends to increase with age. The World Health Organization estimates that 2 million deaths worldwide are directly related to sedentary lifestyles. A sedentary lifestyle greatly increases the chances of becoming obese and can worsen anxiety and depression. The nearly universal access to television and digital media has served to promote our sedentary lifestyles. The Centers for Disease Control recommends that we exercise at least 150 minutes per week to avoid unnecessary weight gain and promote heart health, and that we make exercise part of an overall healthy lifestyle.\n\n7.\u00a0 Eat your breakfast.\n\nIt may sound trivial, but eating breakfast can have lasting, positive effects on your health. When we eat a healthy, well-balanced breakfast sometime in the two hours after we wake up, our bodies begin to burn calories right away, changing how we metabolize sugars and helping maintain healthy insulin levels. Skipping breakfast can lead to frequent snacking during the day and overeating at dinner, because the prolonged fast since dinner the night before releases large amounts of \"hunger hormones\" that can cause unhealthy food cravings. Many snacks are calorie-dense and nutrient-poor and can lead to numerous health problems, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. Studies have shown that eating breakfast makes you more likely to be physically active early in the day, which reduces the risk of becoming obese. Children and adults who eat breakfast are generally more productive, have more energy and are mentally sharper than those who skip a meal in the morning.\n\nUnhealthy habits can sabotage your goals \u2014 both personal and professional \u2014 for 2017 and for the rest of your life. Take time to reflect and review your health status this week, and resolve to make smart decisions going forward. Let's leave these Seven Deadly Habits behind!\n\n\n\nDr. Kevin Campbell is an assistant Professor of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of North Carolina and \u00a0President, K-Roc Consulting LLC.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.15870571136475, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1064, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.90692517849, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 5, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161230210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.06766917293233, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2016/12/06/is-it-safe-to-eat-weeds/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1117, "scraper_regex": 1211}}, "headline": "Is it safe to eat weeds?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1211, "date": "20161206110000", "story_content": "Consider the poor, unloved weed: the scourge of gardeners, that reliable representative of unchecked growth, the rangy opportunist peeking from cracks in the sidewalks.\n\nNow consider eating it.\n\nConsider the wild, bitter flavor that's common to many undomesticated edible greens. Consider eating these plants as part of a holiday celebration, as one may do in Japan, or eating them slow-cooked in a stew with pork and chiles, as is commonly done in Mexico. Weeds aren't factory-farmed; they're optimized to the conditions of wherever they happen to be growing; they are, by definition, a local food. Plus\u2014cheap as hell.\n\nSpeaking of definitions: What do we mean when we talk about weeds? There are some characteristics that may attach to the concept\u2014exuberant growth, a certain quality of nuisance. But according to the dictionary itself the (sort of sad) truth is this: A weed is a \"plant that is not valued where it is growing.\"\n\nSo there you have it. Weeds are not a class of vegetable. They're not an inherent threat to successful gardens, nor some broad category of indigestible plant. They're simply something that, according to the judgment of a broader cuisine or a culture, is unwanted.\n\nBut what if that judgment is wrong?\n\nWhat makes wild plants nutritious is the same thing that has, historically in the U.S., made them undesirable. \"A lot of wild plants that aren't popular have bitter qualities that we've over time bred out of a lot of our plants,\" Kristen Rasmussen, a nutritionist, cook, forager, and co-investigator at the Berkeley Open Food Source (BOFS), told me.\n\nIn fact, there's plenty of grocery-store fare that's less nutritious than its wild relatives, including fennel and lettuce. That's because wild greens tend to be specifically heavy in phytonutrients, a kind of antioxidant that's thought to help prevent cancer and cardiovascular disease. Wild dandelion, for instance, contains seven times more phytonutrients than spinach. Tests conducted by the BOFS found that wild dandelions also contain about twice as much fiber and iron, and more calcium, than their domesticated counterparts.\n\n\"The bitter compounds [in weeds] can signal something that we're not supposed to eat,\" Rasmussen said. Aversion to bitterness has an evolutionary component, helping humans avoid toxic plants, like rhubarb leaves. But bitterness is a flavor imparted by many phytonutrients, which also contribute bitterness to chocolate, red wine, and green tea, the taste of which you don't tend to hear a lot of complaints about. It's possible we've overreacted, and farmers over generations have selected plants that are sweeter, milder, you could even say blander\u2014and, accordingly, far less nutritious.\n\nIn truth, in the U.S., wild greens never went away altogether, though they're rare at the supermarket. As Ronni Lundy writes in her forthcoming book, Victuals, a volume of Appalachian recipes and history, people in the mountains have long eaten wild greens\u2014pokeweed, dock, purslane, lamb's quarters, and upland cress, locally called creasy greens. When she was young, Lundy's parents moved out of Appalachia in search of jobs. \"When my parents lived in Detroit during World War II so my daddy could work in the factories, my mother gathered dandelion and other wild greens from the median of a boulevard,\" Lundy writes. \"She told me she couldn't find kale or mustard in the grocery, but the tender greens cooked with bacon provided a taste of home.\"\n\nOutside of the states, weeds are even more embraced. In January in Japan, people celebrate the Festival of Seven Herbs by eating a porridge made with seven wild herbs of spring. And Mexican cuisine has a name for a whole class of wild greens called quelites\u2014\"basically an umbrella term for any type of green grown in Mexico that has small edible leaves,\" such as amaranth, malva, and epazote, said Lesley Tellez, the author of the cookbook Eat Mexico: Recipes From Mexico City's Streets, Markets and Fondas, and the proprietor of the blog The Mija Chronicles. On that blog, Tellez has written repeatedly about quelites, with recipes for guisado de quelite\u2014stewed greens\u2014and purslane in salsa verde.\n\nThough quelites have traditionally been thought of in Mexico more as peasant food, Tellez said, \"I think that perception is changing. More and more people are realizing that they're packed with nutrients, they're delicious, and they're relatively inexpensive.\" She attributes the changing attitudes to an embrace of Mexican cooking. \"For a long time in Mexico it was considered more fashionable to look outward, and to look at European cuisines, and to look at the United States. In the past 20 to 30 years, there were chefs who really started to plant the seeds of looking inward, reexamining the cuisine, looking at the rich tradition that Mexican food really has, and for the first time saying, hey, this is awesome.\"\n\nIn the U.S. there is at least one foraged plant that garners attention: ramps, the wild-growing allium that, come spring, is the hottest wild food on the block. But the popularity of ramps isn't unproblematic. Overharvesting can damage the plant's long-term prospects and threaten the health of its surrounding habitat. In Quebec, as Epicurious explained last year, the commercial sale of ramps has been illegal since 1995, owing to concerns about overharvesting.\n\nIt's not just ramps; other wild plants are at similar risk. In their 2012 cookbook Foraged Flavor, for instance, authors Tama Matsuoka Wong and Eddy Leroux organized wild plants into groups of green, yellow, and red, the first comprising species that should be picked with abandoned\u2014mostly invasive, aggressive plants like garlic mustard. Yellow denoted plants that should be harvested advisedly, like ramps, elderflower, and cattails; the authors say a good rule of thumb is to take only 20 percent of what you find. Red plants, such as anise hyssop, should be picked only from your garden.\n\nIn California, the Berkeley Open Food Source is trying to spread the word on weeds\u2014specifically wild foods that are available in urban areas. In the Bay Area these include nasturtium leaves, wild mustard and radish, and nuts from the California bay laurel tree, which Kristen Rasmussen says taste like \"coffee and chocolate combined\" when they're toasted. (She provides further information, and suggestions for further use, on her website.)\n\nThe organization has sponsored wild-food walks and wild-food weeks at local restaurants, and BOFS advocates for forager-friendly public policy, like reduced herbicide use. But the group is also thinking more creatively about what wild foods can do. For instance, trying to encourage farmers to sell weeds rather than discard them. And BOFS has mapped three areas in Berkeley, Oakland, and Richmond with limited access to groceries and fresh produce, and where wild foods might provide easily accessible, affordable nutrition.\n\nPart of the process involves soil testing to allay concerns over toxins. (And over other stuff: The first question in an FAQ on the organization's website is \"What about dog pee?\") And part of it is just about public education\u2014teaching people to identify what's edible and what's not. This is probably easier in verdant Northern California than it might be in less temperate climes, but Rasmussen recommended getting a book or two\u2014there's plenty out there\u2014and asking around about local experts and foraging tours. \"There's a lot of cool social networking happening in the wild-food world,\" she said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.312012493610382, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1117, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.00412797137, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161206110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.70098478066249, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/22/search-for-missing-relatives-in-mexican-city-marks-2-years.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [75]}}, "headline": "Search for missing relatives in Mexican city marks 2 years", "wordcount_as_scraped": 714, "date": "20161123060000", "story_content": "IGUALA, Mexico \u2013 \u00a0In the two years since dozens of families in the southern Mexico state of Guerrero banded together to search for relatives who have disappeared, Maria Carmen Figueroa Acevedo has missed only one weekly gathering.\n\nWithout hesitation she says she believes her son Ricardo is alive. She dreams regularly of his homecoming.\n\nSpending each Tuesday with other families like hers is a weekly dose of hope and why the group has made it to its second anniversary this month. \"It gives me the strength to continue,\" Figueroa said.\n\nThe Other Disappeared collective stopped short of calling the milestone a celebration, given the tragedies behind the group's formation. But some 150 relatives turned out Tuesday at site recently occupied for their headquarters, a large property they cleared themselves with a concrete structure spruced up with paint to hold their meetings.\n\nThey grapple with a problem that is widespread in Mexico. Nearly 28,000 people were reported missing across the country from 2007 through the end of July, according to government statistics. The real total is believed to be significantly higher due to the fact that many families do not report their loved ones' disappearances out of fear, because many of the disappearances are believed tied to drug violence and reprisals by cartels.\n\nThe Iguala group gained notice in 2015 when The Associated Press interviewed relatives of more than 150 of the disappeared in and around Iguala. The vast majority of their missing were young men.\n\nSince its formation two years ago, the group's members have had the remains of 18 relatives returned to them by authorities. Five more sets of remains have been identified and await transfer to their families, said Adriana Bahena Cruz, a representative of the group.\n\nThey plan to remodel the building on their headquarters site to have two training rooms and a multi-purpose meeting space. Eventually, they hope to partner with a genetics lab so they can have DNA testing done at the site. They would also like to attract a business, perhaps a factory of some kind, to provide employment for the families, especially the jobless female members left alone to raise children by the disappearance of husbands.\n\nThe site on Iguala's north side will be called Victims' City.\n\n\"The Victims' City is a place where people can come for help,\" Bahena said.\n\nThe Other Disappeared collective formed in November 2014, less than two months after 43 students from a rural teachers college were abducted by local police in Iguala and turned over to a drug cartel. The students' disappearances drew so much national and international attention that other families, many for the first time, came forward to say they had missing relatives, too.\n\nThey began meeting every Tuesday in a church to press their cases. And on Sundays they ventured into the mountains surrounding Iguala to search for signs of secret graves under a punishing sun.\n\nLast month, when leaders of Mexico's Executive Commission for Victims Assistance held a public meeting in Iguala with the governor of Guerrero and representatives of the families, the agency said that up to that point they had assisted the families of 295 missing people in and around Iguala.\n\nIn spite of an intensive federal police and military presence since the disappearance of the 43 students, violent crime still sows fear in Iguala, a city that is a center of heroin trafficking. There were 130 killings in the city through October, which was already 24 percent ahead of the total for all of 2015.\n\nMaria del Rosario Noveron Aguilar, who has been searching for her son and daughter-in-law since April 2014, said new members continue to join the Other Disappeared.\n\n\"There is a great need to find our relatives,\" Noveron said. \"People continue disappearing.\"\n\nIn an interview with the AP, the Interior Department's deputy secretary for human rights questioned the concept of Victims' City.\n\n\"We said clearly that we did not agree with the proposal because it meant re-victimizing,\" Roberto Campa said, adding that the international norm is to try to reincorporate victims into society at large, not do something that \"maintains them as victims.\"\n\nBut Bahena said the name came from the group itself.\n\n\"To us \u2014 the victims \u2014 the name doesn't bother us,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, that's the label they have given us.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.095112323760991, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 699, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.0599709273, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161123060000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.4334763948497904, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/04/former-cuban-leader-fidel-castros-final-resting-spot-shrouded-in-mystery.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [91]}}, "headline": "Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro's final resting spot shrouded in mystery", "wordcount_as_scraped": 762, "date": "20161204090000", "story_content": "SANTIAGO, Cuba  \u2013 \u00a0About a year ago, trucks full of building materials began arriving at the Santa Ifigenia cemetery in the eastern Cuban city of Santiago. On Saturday, a white cloth was draped over a new structure near the mausoleum for Cuban independence leader Jose Marti.\n\nBeyond those few clues, the details of Fidel Castro's final resting place have been one of the most tightly kept secrets in Cuba. That is expected to end on Sunday morning, when the revolutionary leader's ashes are interred in a ceremony expected to give the world at least a brief glimpse of a tomb that will immediately become one of the most important sites on the island.\n\nCuban officials have said nothing about future access to Castro's tomb, but its apparent location alongside Marti's, a grand site heavily visited by tourists and Cubans alike, indicates that there will be some form of public access to the grave of the man who led Cuba for nearly 50 years and died on Nov. 25 at 90.\n\n\"It's a privilege to have him here,\" said Cruz Maria Pardo, 64, who worked at the cemetery cleaning the mausoleums for more than 20 years and said she had seen trucks bringing in materials for a little over a year.\n\nThousands if not millions of Cubans have lined the central roadway connecting the island's two largest cities over the last four days, chanting and waving banners as the cedar coffin carrying his remains drove by. In the country's vast, rural stretches, Cubans packed into buses and tractor trailers, many as part of work or school groups, to wait hours under a blistering sun to say goodbye.\n\nOn Sunday, his remains reached Santiago, the city where Castro launched his revolution and where a final, mass gathering in the city's Revolution Plaza was held before his ashes are interred at Santa Ifigenia.\n\nThe cemetery is located in the northwestern part of Santiago, about a half-kilometer from the bay. It was founded in 1868 and is the final resting place of some of the most important figures in Cuban history. Beyond a stately, white building at the entrance lies Marti's large mausoleum, a tower where there is a changing of the guard every half hour. Nearby stands a memorial to rebels killed in or executed by Batista's forces after the 1953 attack on the Moncada Barracks, Castro's initial, failed attempt to foment revolution.\n\n\"It's been a while since they've been bringing materials,\" said Roberto Lamar Herrera, 73, a retired railroad manager.\n\n\"We are going to take care of him,\" said his daughter, Ileana Lamar Rodriguez, 50.\n\nFurther into the cemetery lies the tomb of Compay Segundo, the singer and guitarist who garnered worldwide fame as a member of the Buena Vista Club. His above-ground tomb bears the image of a golden guitar, cloaked in one of his signature Panama hats.\n\nSanta Ifigenia also houses the remains of historic figures whose families fled after the revolution and are seldom mentioned by officials, like Emilio Bacardi Moreau, who managed his family's rum dynasty and died in 1922. The Bacardi family left Cuba in the early years of the revolution after their properties were nationalized by the Castro government.\n\n\"All of the revolution's history is concentrated at that cemetery,\" said Jose Francisco Guillot Castillo, 59, a cook in an oil refinery who lives in a house with a tin roof on the nearby Raul Perozo Avenue.\n\nResidents along the winding street spent Saturday making signs with revolutionary phrases like \"I am Fidel,\" and hanging Cuban flags from their doorways. The street is named after a revolutionary fighter who residents say was dragged through the street and killed by Batista's forces.

As commander-in-chief, he flexed France's military muscle from the Mideast to Mali.\n\nYet he was the least loved French president of modern times, because French voters felt he failed them where it mattered most \u2014 their paychecks, taxes and job prospects. He seemed to let go of the wheel when it came to the economy, veering left, then right, and letting divisions in his Socialist party eclipse his economic reforms.\n\nHe promised a 75 percent tax on the super-rich, painfully tried to implement it, then abandoned the idea.\n\nHe vowed to curb unemployment, yet French joblessness stubbornly stayed around 10 percent.\n\nHe pledged to fight austerity, then slashed government spending.\n\nHe raised taxes, then cut them.\n\nHollande championed labor reforms meant to give employers more freedom, but infuriated many who feared the moves undermined workers' rights, unleashing months of violent protests.\n\n\"I served the country with sincerity, with honesty,\" Hollande told the nation Thursday night. Expressing concerns about rising populism and acknowledging the risks to the French left of a weak presidential bid, he said: \"I have decided not to be a candidate.\"\n\nIt was a stunning announcement for its emotion and lucidity \u2014 but also since it reflected courage for a lifelong politician to admit his failings and walk away.\n\nHollande, a 62-year-old bachelor with four kids, has been a bit of a paradox all along, someone who wanted to remain ordinary while running a country of 65 million people with nuclear weapons.\n\nFrom the day he took office in 2012, his hair and glasses drenched in his rainy inaugural parade because he refused a presidential umbrella, it was hard to believe the jovial, approachable Hollande was really in charge.\n\nHe even tried to keep his sexual dalliances down-to-earth: When he started an affair with actress Julie Gayet, he rode a motorbike to her flat in a simple white bike helmet \u2014 presidential security be damned.\n\nParisian Marion Laulier blamed the Socialist party for failing to rally around Hollande's reforms, and for being afraid \"to see that France and the world are on the move, and they need to be more realistic and responsible.\" She praised Hollande and his courage, but said he \"was unable to explain to us all of his decisions, his choices, that's his mistake.\"\n\nAt times Hollande proved to be decisive \u2014 sending troops to quash extremists in Mali and Central African Republic, and legalizing gay marriage despite resistance. But often, his positions were muddy.\n\n\"Some say black, some white and he says gray ... but in France, people want a president of authority,\" said Fabrice Lhomme, who co-authored an unusually close-up recent book on Hollande titled \"A President Shouldn't Say That...\"\n\nHollande's path to the presidency was long overshadowed by more charismatic figures.\n\nFirst Segolene Royal, the mother of his children, ran for the Socialists in the 2007 presidential race because she seemed more electable than party leader Hollande.\n\nThen Dominique Strauss-Kahn was long considered the front-runner for the 2012 presidential race, until a New York sex scandal torpedoed his career \u2014 leaving Hollande as the Socialists' next-best hope.\n\nHollande won the 2012 election, but some voters chose him simply because he wasn't Nicolas Sarkozy, the outgoing conservative president whose flashy style and angry rhetoric alienated many.\n\nIn deciding to step aside after a troubled four and a half years, Hollande earned praise from voters and rivals alike for his integrity.\n\n\"I think this was perhaps the best thing to do to ... try to bring the left together,\" Paris commuter Vincent Forbin said Friday.\n\nFar right leader Marine Le Pen, hoping to ride Europe's populist wave to the French presidency, said it was \"an act of lucidity on the part of Mr. Hollande, considering the results of his presidential term and the disenchantment and the total absence of confidence from the French people.\"\n\nPrime Minister Manuel Valls, a potential Socialist presidential contender, praised Hollande's \"tough, mature, serious choice\" and insisted it was too early to rule on his boss' legacy.\n\n\"History will, of course, put back into perspective the action carried on over the past five years. We must defend his record,\" Valls said.\n\n___\n\nSylvie Corbet and Masha Macpherson in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.0606060028076203, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 733, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.67628081042, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8649386084583903, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/21/trump-wraps-up-ceremony-turns-to-governing.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [56]}}, "headline": "Trump wraps up ceremony, turns to governing", "wordcount_as_scraped": 623, "date": "20170121090000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0As President Donald Trump wrapped up the ceremony of his inauguration and shifted to governing, he signaled he intends to move quickly to make a clean break from the Obama administration.\n\nTrump spent his first night in the White House and was slated to start his first full day in office at a national prayer service Saturday morning. The traditional gathering was the last piece of the transition ritual for the new president before he was clear to get to work.\n\nTrump took his first steps in that direction on Friday. Before attending his inaugural balls, he signed an executive order aimed at undermining former President Barack Obama's signature health care law. The order notes that Trump plans to seek the \"prompt repeal\" of the law. But in the meantime, it allows the Health and Human Services Department and other federal agencies to delay implementing any piece of the law that might impose a \"fiscal burden\" on states, health care providers, families or individuals.\n\nTrump also cleared the way for members of his national security team to take their places. He signed legislation granting James Mattis, his pick for defense secretary, a one-time exception from federal law barring former U.S. service members who have been out of uniform for less than seven years from holding the top Pentagon job. The restriction is meant to preserve civilian control of the military. Mattis, 66, retired from the Marine Corps in 2013.\n\nHours later, Mattis was confirmed by the Senate as Trump watched his inaugural parade from a stand outside the White House. The Senate later confirmed retired Gen. John Kelly to lead the Homeland Security Department. Vice President Mike Pence swore-in both men late Friday.\n\nIn a separate step Friday, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus issued a memo aimed at freezing some new regulations and halting ones that Obama's administration had started.\n\nTrump brought his signature style to the task of governing, sprinkling his comments at three inaugural balls with references to \"phony polls,\" campaign victories and social media.\n\n\"Let me ask you: should I keep the Twitter going?\" he asked a cheering crowd of supporters before dancing with his wife, Melania, to Frank Sinatra's \"My Way\" at the second of three inaugural balls. \"The enemies keep saying, 'Oh that's terrible,' but it's a way of bypassing dishonest media.'\"\n\nOn Saturday, Trump was due to attend a prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral, an Episcopal parish with a dual role as a civic gathering place. The cathedral has for years hosted a prayer service for the new president. But keeping the tradition has sparked debate this year among Episcopalians opposed to Trump's policies.\n\nIt's the latest example of the backlash against religious leaders, artists, celebrities and other participants in events surrounding the inaugural.\n\nWhile some in the largely liberal congregation objected to hosting the service, Bishop Mariann Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington wrote in a blog post that she shared \"a sense of outrage at some of the president-elect's words and actions\" but also she felt an obligation to welcome all people without qualification, especially those who disagree and need to find a way to work together.\n\nTrump was also expected to visit the CIA on Saturday, meeting with members of the nation's intelligence community. The visit may be fraught with tension. Trump has sharply criticized the nation's top intelligence officials for their assertions about Russian hacking and leaks about his briefings in the weeks before he was sworn in.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters before the inauguration that the visit would involve several departments and Trump intended to offer his appreciation for their service to the country.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Lerer contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.911854088306427, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 616, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.10804491916, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170121090000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.03246753246753, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/science/2016/12/08/mythical-sea-blob-finally-spotted-century-after-its-discovery.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [639, 2574]}}, "headline": "'Mythical' sea blob finally spotted a century after its discovery ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 706, "date": "20161208120000", "story_content": "A mysterious sea blob that looks like a psychedelic Slinky has finally been spotted, more than a century after it was first described.\n\nThe translucent, sea-dwelling invertebrate, called Bathochordaeus charon, was identified recently off the coast of Monterey, California, by scientists using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Though B. charon was first discovered a century ago, no one had managed to confirm its existence in all those years, Rob Sherlock, a scientist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute who found the creature, told Live Science in an email.\u00a0[See Photos of the Translucent Sea Blob]\n\nB. charon belongs to a group of sea creatures known as larvaceans \u2014 normally teensy, millimeter-size creatures whose bodies resemble a tadpole's, with a large \"head\" (actually a trunk) and a tail, Sherlock said.\n\nThough the sea is teeming with tiny larvaceans, the larger versions, which can have bodies extending up to 3.9 inches, are much less common. To eat, the sea blob filters food through its shimmering, parachute-like mucus \"house\" almost 3.3 feet in length. By waving its tail, it stirs the water and pulls particles directly into its house. Large particles get trapped and form a fine dusting of marine \"snow\" on the house, while the smaller particles pass through, concentrating and then funneling into a feeding tube that goes into the mouth, Sherlock said. (The tiny larvaceans also don mucus homes, but they're smaller.)\n\nIf a passing squid or fish crashes through the house, or big particles clog the feeding tube, larvaceans simply move on and build another house. Without their houses, they cannot eat, Sherlock said.\n\nThe first report of B. charon's existence came in 1899, when professor Carl Chun of Leipzig University came across one in the south Atlantic Ocean while leading the Valdivia Expedition, a German mission aimed at exploring the deep sea. Chun believed the creature welled up from the deepest depths of the ocean, so he named the larvacean after Charon, who in Greek mythology ferries the souls of the dead across the river Styx, the researchers reported Aug. 16 in the journal Marine Biodiversity Records .\n\nIn the decades that followed, several other naturalists reported spotting giant larvaceans, though only a few were captured alive and described thoroughly. In 1936, for instance, British marine biologist Walter Garstang collected a set of giant larvaceans that differed from Chun's, and they were classified as a new species, Bathochordaeus stygius.\u00a0[Marine Marvels: Spectacular Photos of Sea Creatures]\n\nBecause the two sets of specimens were similar and Chun's originals were lost to history, scientists eventually began to wonder whether Chun's originally described B. charon was actually the same species as B. stygius. One famous larvacean expert even suggested combining the two species names, Sherlock said. Part of the difficulty in capturing these creatures is that they don't fare well in the trawling nets typically used to collect specimens, Sherlock said.\n\nSherlock and his colleagues happened upon the new species when the team's ROV, called Doc Ricketts, was exploring the waters of Monterey Bay. As soon as they saw it, the crew carefully collected it in a sealed, thermally insulated container.\n\n\"Since the vehicle was recovered some tens of minutes later, the animal was alive, in fantastic shape, and we preserved it right away in order to send it to the Smithsonian,\" Sherlock said. \"We had no idea, until we looked more closely at the specimen, that we had actually found B. charon, the species first described over a hundred years ago.\"\n\nGenetics and analysis of physical features confirmed the find, Sherlock said. It was official: There really were two distinct species of giant larvacean \u2014 B. stygius and B. charon.\n\n\"It felt like Chun had finally been vindicated after years of doubt,\" Sherlock said.\n\nWhen the team went back over videos from Monterey Bay from the past 25 years, they realized the creature had been spotted many times in the bay. Whether they dwell in places between Monterey Bay and the South Atlantic, however, remains to be seen.\n\nStill, this mythical sea blob is fairly rare; over the course of the past few decades, biologists have seen hundreds of B. stygius, but captured footage of only a dozen B. charon individuals, Sherlock said.\n\nOriginal article on Live Science .\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.502512574195862, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 679, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.84299923111, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.76730486008837, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/29/us-judge-bars-deportations-under-trump-travel-ban.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [62]}}, "headline": "US judge bars deportations under Trump travel ban", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1065, "date": "20170129090000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0A federal judge's emergency order has temporarily barred the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. The judge said travelers who had been detained had a strong argument that their legal rights had been violated.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security issued a statement early Sunday that said the court ruling would not affect the overall implementation of the White House order and it affected a relatively small number of travelers who were inconvenienced by security procedures upon their return.\n\nThe emergency order was issued by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York Saturday night after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect.\n\nThe judge's order addressed only a portion of Trump's executive action. As the decision was announced, cheers broke out in crowds of demonstrators who had gathered at American airports and outside the Brooklyn courthouse where the ruling was issued.\n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also covered anyone with an approved refugee application.\n\nIt was unclear how quickly the judge's order might affect people in detention, or whether it would allow others to resume flying.\n\n\"Realistically, we don't even know if people are going to be allowed onto the planes,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said. \"This order would protect people who they allow to come here and reach U.S. soil.\"\n\nDHS said the court ruling would have no effect on the overall executive action.\n\n\"President Trump's Executive Orders remain in place \u2014 prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\" according to the DHS statement.\n\nStephen Miller, a senior adviser to the White House, said: \"Nothing in the Brooklyn judge's order in anyway impedes or prevents the implementation of the president's executive order which remains in full, complete and total effect.\"\n\nUnder Trump's order, it had appeared that an untold number of foreign-born U.S. residents now traveling outside the U.S. could be stuck overseas for at least 90 days even though they held permanent residency green cards or other visas. However, an official with the Department of Homeland Security said Saturday night that no green-card holders from the seven countries cited in Trump's order had been prevented from entering the U.S.\n\nSome foreign nationals who were allowed to board flights before the order was signed Friday had been detained at U.S. airports, told they were no longer welcome. The DHS official who briefed reporters by phone said 109 people who were in transit on airplanes had been denied entry and 173 had not been allowed to get on their planes overseas.\n\nIn her three-page order, Donnelly wrote that without the stay \"there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders and other individuals from nations subject to the Jan. 27, 2017, executive order.\"\n\nTrump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to the U.S. It included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program.\n\nTrump's order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, indefinitely blocking entry for anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war.\n\nThe directive did not do anything to prevent attacks from homegrown extremists who were already in America, a primary concern of federal law enforcement officials. It also omitted Saudi Arabia, home to most of the Sept. 11 hijackers.\n\nAs a candidate Trump pledged to temporarily ban Muslims from coming to the U.S., then said he would implement \"extreme vetting\" for people from countries with significant terror concerns. He told reporters Saturday the order is \"not a Muslim ban.\"\n\n\"It's working out very nicely,\" Trump said of the implementation of his order. \"We're going to have a very, very strict ban and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\"\n\nThe order sparked protests at several of the nation's international airports, including New York's Kennedy and Chicago's O'Hare and facilities in Minneapolis and Dallas-Fort Worth. In San Francisco, hundreds blocked the street outside the arrival area of the international terminal. Several dozen demonstrated at the airport in Portland, Oregon, briefly disrupting light rail service while hoisting signs that read \"Portland Coffee Is From Yemen\" and chanting anti-Trump slogans. U.S. lawmakers and officials around the globe also criticized the move.\n\nTwo of the first people blocked from entering the United States were Iraqis with links to the U.S. military. Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi were detained by immigration officials after landing at New York's Kennedy airport Friday night. Both had been released by Saturday night after their lawyers intervened.\n\nThe government can exempt foreign nationals from the ban if their entry is deemed in the national interest. But it was not immediately clear how that exemption might be applied.\n\nDiplomats from the seven countries singled out by Trump's order would still be allowed into the U.S.\n\nThose already in the U.S. with a visa or green card would be allowed to stay, according to the official, who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order was being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump's order also directed U.S. officials to review information as needed to fully vet foreigners asking to come to the U.S. and draft a list of countries that don't provide that information. That left open the possibility that citizens of other countries could also face a travel ban.\n\nThe U.S. may still admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government would continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Darlene Superville and Eric Tucker in Washington, Ellen Knickmeyer in San Francisco, Jeff Karoub in Detroit, and Karen Matthews, Rachel Zoll, Verena Dobnik and William Mathis in New York contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Alicia A.

Upon his release, Abdi will be deported to Somalia.\n\nProsecutors at the time said Abdi made threatening comments about an unspecified shopping mall during a meeting with two other alleged terrorists on Aug. 8, 2002, at a coffee shop in suburban Columbus.\n\nAbdi and the two \"could attack the mall with a bomb,\" Abdi told his friends, according to court documents.\n\nOne of the men with Abdi that day was Iyman Faris, who pleaded guilty in May 2003 to providing material support for terrorism. A Pakistani immigrant, Faris was convicted of plotting to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nThe motive behind Monday's attack on the Ohio State campus is still unknown but investigators are looking into the possibility of it being a terrorist attack.\n\nOhio State Police Chief Craig Stone said the attacker, later identified as Abdul Artan, deliberately drove over a curb and into pedestrians.\n\n\"This was done on purpose,\" Stone said.\n\nThose in the Somali community of Columbus find the latest incident troubling.\n\nHassan Omar, president of the Somali Community Association of Ohio, said according to reports that the news of the attacker being Somali was upsetting.\n\n\"This is a shock,\" he said. \"As a Somali community here, we are in a state of shock. In Columbus, we live in a very peaceful community. This is going to affect the life of everybody. We are American and we don't want somebody to create this problem.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 20, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -9.3908634185791, "HarmVice": 22, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 729, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 8.177776779650001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 12, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 57, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161128230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 5.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 7.81893004115226, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/17/us-jews-grapple-with-election-year-eruption-anti-semitism.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [71]}}, "headline": "US Jews grapple with election-year eruption of anti-Semitism", "wordcount_as_scraped": 875, "date": "20161117210000", "story_content": "NEW YORK \u2013 \u00a0American Jews gathered Thursday to wrestle with how they should confront an election-year surge in anti-Semitism, a level of bias not seen in the U.S. for decades.\n\nAt a national meeting of the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish civil rights group, about 1,000 people listened to talks expressing shock at the hatred expressed during the presidential campaign and questioned what they thought was a high-level of acceptance by other Americans.\n\n\"I'm struggling right now in this American moment,\" said Yehuda Kurtzer, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America, an education and research organization, in his talk at the event. \"I wonder whether I have been \u2014 and I think the answer is probably yes \u2014 a little bit naive.\"\n\nDuring this past year, anti-Semitic imagery proliferated on social media, Jewish journalists were targeted and longstanding anti-Jewish conspiracy theories got a fresh airing. Much of the bias originated with the alt-right, or alternative right, a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It's often associated with far right efforts to preserve \"white identity,\" oppose multiculturalism and defend \"Western values.\"\n\nIn addition to the online intimidation, reports of anti-Semitic vandalism and other attacks have risen. Last week, the day after the election, a Philadelphia storefront was sprayed with a swastika and the words \"Seig Heil 2106,\" which means \"Hail Victory,\" a common Nazi chant, and the word \"Trump,\" with a swastika replacing the \"T.\"\n\nThese developments have stunned U.S. Jewish leaders, who in recent years had been more focused on anti-Semitism in Europe and on addressing complaints of anti-Jewish bias on college campuses amid the debate over the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israeli policies toward the Palestinians.\n\nIn a sign of the depth of American Jewish anxiety about anti-Semitism, ADL officials said donations to their organization increased 50-fold in the days immediately after the election and a large majority of the money came from first-time donors. Every one of their regional offices reported an uptick in calls from people wanting to donate or volunteer, the ADL said.\n\n\"We must not be silent, we must raise our voices, we must act, and to act we must understand what we are up against,\" said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of ADL, opening the meeting in Manhattan.\n\nAs the presidential race intensified, Jews started seeing their names bracketed with a series of parentheses in harassing tweets, signaling that the person had been identified as a Jew. The image became known as the Jewish cowbell and its source was traced to neo-Nazis and white nationalists.\n\nThe ADL investigated the harassment and found more than 800 journalists had suffered anti-Semitic attacks on Twitter during the election, mostly from anonymous Twitter accounts, although some belonged to white supremacists. In a common example of the reporters' experiences, Jane Eisner, editor-in-chief of the Forward, an influential Jewish newspaper that extensively covered the election, said she received an email the morning after the second presidential debate with an image of a Nazi solder pointing a gun at her head, which was Photoshopped onto a concentration camp uniform.\n\nDonald Trump's campaign came under scrutiny since much of the harassment came from accounts tied to his supporters.\n\nTrump drew direct criticism last July when he tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton's face with a six-pointed star, a pile of hundred dollar bills and the words \"most corrupt candidate ever.\" The star was in the shape of the Jewish Star of David and was widely condemned as anti-Semitic. Trump's campaign said it was a sheriff's badge.\n\nLast month, Trump gave a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, in which he accused Clinton of holding secret meetings with bankers in a conspiracy to undermine U.S. sovereignty. The ADL said that whether intentional or not, Trump had reflected a classic anti-Semitic theme of Jewish control of banks.\n\nThe president-elect's daughter Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who is now one of his top advisers, are Orthodox Jews. Kushner has defended Trump against allegations of bias.\n\nThe issue erupted anew when Trump announced far-right publishing executive Stephen Bannon as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway called the accusations against Bannon \"very unfair.\"\n\nSome Jewish groups have defended Bannon, including the hawkish Zionist Organization of America. Bernie Marcus, a founder of The Home Depot Inc. and board member of the Republican Jewish Coalition, said in a statement that Bannon was \"a passionate Zionist and supporter of Israel.\" Marcus called the condemnations of Bannon an attempt to undermine the incoming administration. Seventy-one percent of Jews voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls. Greenblatt worked in the Obama administration.\n\nStill, Jonathan Sarna, a Brandeis University professor and historian of American Judaism, said it would be wrong to attribute the criticisms of Trump appointments or his supporters to partisanship. \"I don't know anybody who is looking at this in a serious way who says nothing has changed,\" in regard to the level of anti-Semitism, Sarna said.\n\n\"American Jews assumed that anti-Semitism had largely been overcome,\" he said. \"And then all of a sudden, unexpectedly, anti-Semitism of a virulent kind came roaring back.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.17970418930054, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 856, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.3105936413, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161117210000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997, "FairnessVice": 5, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.2710280373831804, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/14/john-stossel-what-skating-rink-can-tell-us-about-life-and-government.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4174, 4274]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 636, "scraper_regex": 722}}, "headline": "John Stossel: What a skating rink can tell us about life (and government)", "wordcount_as_scraped": 722, "date": "20161214060000", "story_content": "My last Fox Business Network TV show airs Friday.\n\nThat news pleases some people, like internet trolls who write that they are happy to be \"rid of that noted LIAR and falsifier of news\" who produces \"hit pieces.\" Another wrote, \"Hopefully the cancer came back to finish him off.\"\n\nTo be clear, I'm not ending \"Stossel\" because I have cancer. I don't have cancer. I had a small tumor removed, and, best we can tell, it's gone. I didn't even have chemo or radiation.\n\nI'm moving on because I want to create a new libertarian internet-based platform with Reason TV and become an educator with the Charles Koch Institute's new Media and Journalism Fellowship program. I will still make appearances on Fox News.\n\nI had a good time hosting my own show for seven years, trying to find new ways to simplify economics and demonstrate the benefits of free markets.\n\nUnfortunately, economic freedom can be hard to demonstrate. Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\" is, well, invisible. How do I explain it on TV? Friedrich Hayek's phrase \"spontaneous order\" is clearer but still hard to show.\n\nI was stumped until I read \"Rinkonomics: A Window on Spontaneous Order\" by George Mason University's Dan Klein. That inspired me to rent a skating rink.\n\nWhy? Well, imagine you've never seen a rink, and you are the government regulator who approves new businesses.\n\nI tell you: I will flood that arena, freeze the water and then charge people money to strap sharp blades onto their feet and zip around on the ice. I will have few rules. Anyone can skate: young and old, skilled and unskilled.\n\nMost any regulator would resist my bizarre skating idea. Hillary Clinton might say that for my rink to be approved it must have stoplights, skating police and barriers between skilled and unskilled skaters, adults and children. I must have someone with a megaphone direct the skaters to make sure they don't smash into each other.\n\nSo, I actually tried that. I rented a rink and bossed people around: \"You, turn left, you slow down.\" Of course, the skaters hated that. And it didn't make skating safer. Some people, responding to my instructions, lost their balance and fell.\n\nThere is spontaneous order on a normal skating rink. Skaters make their own decisions. No regulator knows the wishes, skills and immediate intentions of individual skaters better than skaters themselves.\n\nRegulators might say my attempts to direct skaters failed because I'm not a skating \"expert.\" On my TV show, one guest said regulation must be done \"by technocrats with expertise.\"\n\nSo I hired an expert, an Olympic skater. She did no better with the megaphone. No \"technocrat\" has enough expertise to direct the skaters on the ice.\n\nFor safety, rinks usually just have a few employees who police reckless skaters and simple rules like \"skate counterclockwise.\" That's enough!\n\nGood thing rinks were invented before the modern regulatory state took over.\n\nLeave people free to make their own choices and a spontaneous order arises. Skaters find their own path. Buyers and sellers adjust to changing prices. Families raise kids. Musicians create jazz.\n\nThat's what I've tried to demonstrate on my show.\n\nControl freaks have criticized such spontaneity for at least 2,400 years. Plato warned that music should be simple so that it does not stir up passion. In America, Ladies Home Journal once warned that jazz would lead \"to a breaking away from all rules.\" Lucky America didn't have a Department of Music Safety then or jazz would have been banned.\n\nOver seven years on the \"Stossel\" show, I've done all sorts of stunts, trying to explain the benefits of liberty. I've dressed as a Founder and Santa and Uncle Sam, begged for money on Manhattan streets, broken windows, collected signatures on petitions to ban \"dangerous\" chemicals like dihydrogen monoxide (that's water), stolen things from children, held a racist (that is, affirmative action) bake sale, smashed cars with a sledgehammer (inspired by the \"cash for clunkers\" government program) and cut the federal budget with a chain saw.\n\nIf it helps explain the benefits of freedom, I'll try it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nJohn Stossel is the author of \"No They Can't!

Named for the monk who started the Reformation over four hundred years earlier, Dr. King would go on to become a Baptist minister and arguably the most important civil rights figure of the twentieth century.\n\nHis religious beliefs and the freedom to exercise and speak out based on those beliefs were essential to his advocacy for nonviolence as means of achieving civil rights for African-Americans. As King reminded us, \"[o]ur lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.\" Yet without a public square that was open for religious conviction to work and speak, his efforts would not have met the success they did.\n\nFast forward to today, Religious Freedom Day 2017, which is on January 16, we find that the religious freedom which enabled Dr. King to do his work is just as needed for the challenges of today. For as King also said, \"[t]here comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right.\"\u00a0 Today, Americans need the same freedom in the workplace, in school, in the public square, in our homes, and in our churches. Everywhere there is air, there must be the freedom of conscience, the freedom of religion, and we must exercise it.\n\nThe importance of retaining this religious voice in the public square, and the feeling that it is under attack, significantly impacted the results of this past November's election. Fifty-nine percent of Trump voters, according to a WPA Opinion Research survey commissioned by Family Research Council, stated that how they cast their ballots was impacted by the Republican Party platform's positions on life and religious liberty. This represents over 37 million voters, and these issues will no doubt continue to be a priority for voters as the new administration takes office in just days.\n\nWhat specifically can President-elect Trump do to demonstrate his commitment to the issue of religious liberty which motivated so many voters to turn out and vote?\n\nTo start, religious liberty in the military needs to be addressed. Over the past several years we have witnessed chaplains being disciplined for their faith, and religious speech being censored. President-elect Trump can direct that religious liberty in the military be clarified and strengthened, and that appropriate training is conducted to ensure the law is followed.\n\nIn addition, our foreign policy, contrary to the law, has not prioritized religious freedom like it should. President-elect Trump must direct that religious freedom be properly integrated into all foreign policy of the United States at every level.\u00a0 As even the United Nations has recognized, religious freedom is not just an American right, it is a human right.\u00a0 Defending that human right has been an American value until recent years.\u00a0\n\nPresident-elect Trump should also follow through with his pledge to issue an executive order, reinstating government-wide protections for religious liberty.\u00a0But executive orders halting attacks on religious freedom are just the start, there are many more anti-religious freedom policies of the Obama administration that must be reversed.\u00a0 That's why government nondiscrimination legislation is needed to protect supporters of marriage between one man and one woman.\u00a0 People of faith should not be punished by the government for living in accordance with their beliefs.\n\nAs we start a new year, Religious Freedom Day marks an era of new opportunity for our First Freedom. Let us look with hope to these advancements and beyond to increased protections for all Americans to live out their faith in the public square.\n\n\n\nTony Perkins is president of the Family Research Council in Washington, D.C.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 4.03337955474854, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 589, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.83176742542, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170116110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.90492359932088, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/04/beijing-to-intervene-in-hong-kong-lawmaker-oath-dispute.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [67]}}, "headline": "Beijing to intervene in Hong Kong lawmaker oath dispute", "wordcount_as_scraped": 725, "date": "20161105050000", "story_content": "HONG KONG \u2013 \u00a0Beijing plans to intervene in a Hong Kong political dispute over two young, newly elected separatist lawmakers in a rare move that is stoking fears the Chinese-ruled city's considerable autonomy and independent judiciary are under threat.\n\nHong Kong's government said Friday that it was informed by China's central government that members of the country's top legislative panel, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, will discuss interpreting an article in Hong Kong's constitution covering oaths taken by lawmakers.\n\nThe move follows a provocative display of anti-China sentiment by the two lawmakers, Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching, at their swearing-in ceremony last month.\n\nBeijing's heavy-handed response could lead to the democratically elected Leung and Yau being disqualified from taking office. Such an outcome would be favorable to China's Communist leaders, who are alarmed by the former British colony's burgeoning independence movement, but is also likely to plunge their troubled relationship into fresh turmoil.\n\nBeijing has stepped in with its interpretation of the Basic Law \u2014 the city's constitution \u2014 on only four occasions, most recently in 2005. The National People's Congress did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.\n\nChina's official Xinhua News Agency said senior lawmakers Friday heard a report on a draft \"explanation\" of the article on oath-taking and indicated it would be tabled for review during the current session that ends Monday.\n\nHong Kong's leader Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying told reporters he wouldn't comment until Beijing issued its ruling.\n\nLeung and Yau of the radical Youngspiration party altered their oaths to insert a disparaging Japanese term for China. Displaying a flag reading \"Hong Kong is not China,\" they vowed to defend the \"Hong Kong nation.\" Leung crossed his fingers while Yau used the F-word in her pledge.\n\nTheir oaths were ruled invalid but attempts at a do-over have resulted in mayhem in the legislature's weekly sessions, as the duo and fellow pro-democracy lawmakers sparred verbally with pro-Beijing rivals and brawled with security guards trying to keep them out of the chamber.\n\nHong Kong's Beijing-backed government has gone to the top court this week with an unprecedented legal challenge aimed at blocking the two from taking office. The government's argument is that they have declined to take the oath.\n\nIt's unclear when the judge will rule, but the Chinese government's decision to take it one step further by bypassing the courts has fanned residents' fears about Beijing's tightening hold.\n\n\"When the situation is not favorable for China's Communists, they use politics to solve a legal problem,\" Yau, 25, told reporters.\n\nLeung, 30, said a Beijing interpretation \"brings a lethal blow to the legal system and the rule of law in Hong Kong.\"\n\nWorries about the erosion of the \"one country, two systems\" principle, which guarantees Hong Kong civil liberties such as freedom of speech and a high level of autonomy until 2047, have intensified after recent incidents such as the secret detention of five booksellers.\n\nA Beijing ruling would also undermine Hong Kong's independent courts by pressuring judges on their decisions, experts said.\n\n\"The mere threat of interpretation strongly suggests that certain officials in the Hong Kong government and Beijing are prepared to tear down Hong Kong's civic institutions \u2014 and 'one country, two systems' \u2014 merely to achieve the 'correct' result,\" said Alvin Cheung, a former Hong Kong lawyer who is now a researcher at New York University's U.S.-Asia Law Institute.\n\nThe saga reflects Beijing's fury about the Youngspiration pair's pro-independence stance, \"given the fact that there have been rhetorical and legal attacks at all levels against them.\" It includes well-organized pro-China protests denouncing the two as traitors and a barrage of attacks in Beijing-controlled media, said Samson Yuen, a politics lecturer at the Open University of Hong Kong.\n\nIn the latest such salvo, an op-ed Friday by the nationalist state-run Global Times newspaper said: \"Disqualifying Leung and Yau will serve as a necessary warning to those pro-independence activists, and show them the disgraceful end they will come to if they stick with their fatuous political cause and keep crossing the line.\"\n\nTheir expulsion \"reflects the will of the entire nation.

His trial is scheduled for Dec. 6.\n\nHe has faced other challenges in his bid for a seventh term.\n\nThe sheriff, who raised $12 million in campaign cash mostly from people living in other states, said he didn't expect liberal hedge-fund tycoon George Soros to give $2.3 million to a group that ran a TV commercial questioning Arpaio's reputation for being tough on criminals.\n\nArpaio also blamed the U.S. Justice Department for announcing a day before early voting began in Arizona that it planned to prosecute him in a criminal contempt case.\n\nThe sheriff said he believes he will be remembered for his tough jail policies, such as dressing inmates in pink underwear and jailing them in Tent City, a complex of canvas tents where prisoners are housed during Phoenix's triple-digit summer heat. Still, he realizes his successor could eliminate those fixtures.\n\nPenzone has said he is open to the idea of closing Tent City and that he regards the pink underwear as a publicity stunt.\n\n\"If someone else wants a change, it doesn't bother me at all,\" Arpaio said.\n\nHe said he could have retired without seeking re-election, but he wanted to remain on the job \u2014 and he doesn't regret seeking re-election.\n\n\"I wanted to keep going for the next four years,\" Arpaio said. \"It wasn't in the cards.\"\n\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.4013156890869105, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 560, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.1439302665099995, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 9, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114170000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.82142857142857, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/08/travelers-lose-25000-items-after-florida-airport-rampage.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [81]}}, "headline": "Travelers lose 25,000 items after Florida airport rampage", "wordcount_as_scraped": 763, "date": "20170108210000", "story_content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2013 \u00a0Dan and Janice Kovacs and their two children were passing through airport security when the gunfire erupted. They were shoeless \u2014 with wallets, passports and carry-on items chugging along a conveyer belt \u2014 when they sprang into the mass of people running to safety.\n\nNow they're among stranded travelers at Fort Lauderdale trying to recover what the airport director says are 25,000 pieces of luggage, cellphones and other belongings separated from their owners during Friday's shooting rampage.\n\n\"We have no IDs, we have no passports, no money,\" Janice, 39, said Saturday afternoon, wearing sandals borrowed from a brother-in-law. \"We just had to leave our stuff and run.\"\n\n\"All our stuff is being processed. We might not even get that until Monday. I have an 11-year-old who is freaking out. This has been traumatic for her,\" she said.\n\nThe shooting Friday afternoon, which killed five people and wounded six, also stranded about 12,000 outgoing and incoming travelers, many returning from cruises or arriving ahead of the usual Saturday departures of the massive ships based in the tourism hub's Port Everglades terminal.\n\nSome travelers were kept on planes for more than seven hours while police put the airport on lockdown; others scrambled to protected corners or were hustled out onto the tarmac. The Kovacs, on the way home to Vancouver, British Columbia, after a Caribbean cruise, went out onto that rough surface barefoot.\n\nThe Florida Highway Patrol sent computer-equipped buses to the airport Saturday afternoon to issue temporary ID cards to help travelers get out of state and even abroad. \"We are doing what we can to help,\" Sgt. Mark Wysocki said.\n\nSydney Rivera, a 21-year-old Purdue University student, received a temporary Florida identification card that is nearly identical to the state's driver's license. On Friday, she had been about to board a flight home to Indianapolis in another terminal when people scattered over false fears of a second shooter.\n\n\"This will make it a lot easier to get through security,\" Rivera said as she rushed to finally catch a flight.\n\nGov. Rick Scott said cruise ship companies were asked to accept travelers with provisional IDs. Once authorities began allowing travelers to depart the airport Friday evening, buses took thousands of them to the cruise terminal.\n\nAirport spokesman Greg Meyer said most bags won't be available until Monday. The airport hired an outside firm to collect discarded bags and sort them by where they were found so they can be identified by their owners. Those with lost luggage were told to call a toll-free number. But there were exceptions as airport officials scrambled to work with individuals.\n\nJessie Khalastchi, a 21-year-old college student from London, left her carry-on bag and laptop that contained a paper for school when she fled the gunfire. She was reunited with her belongings Saturday afternoon, just in time to catch a flight out of Miami. The Kovacs also received some of their luggage late Saturday but were still waiting for their IDs, cellphones, passports and wallets.\n\nRichard Lanbry, his wife and 15-year-old daughter were about to board a plane home for Montreal when the shooting began. Amid the commotion, he was separated from the other two and frantically searched for them for about an hour.\n\n\"I was pushed down, my wife was pushed down too. It was violent ... people screaming, people crying, old and young. It was very scary,\" said the 61-year-old, who was vacationing in Pompano Beach.\n\nOn top of that, they now have no luggage, no keys to their home and no coats or sweaters to wear once they arrive in chilly Montreal, only the T-shirts they we wearing the day before.\n\nLarry and Joy Edwards were about to board their flight home to Columbus, Ohio, after a Caribbean cruise. They ran out the skyway and down stairs onto the tarmac, where they were told to drop their carry-on bags and dash out to the runway. They eventually were taken to a hangar and bused to Port Everglades. That's where they spent most of the night.\n\n\"The Red Cross came. They gave us food and blankets and pillows. Everybody did what they could,\" Joy Edwards said.\n\nAt 4:30 a.m., they were bused to a Miami motel. They had come back to the airport in an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve their luggage, which contained their passports, medicine and other essentials.\n\nLarry Edwards, a retired electric lineman, said they won't be able to get home until Monday and pointed to the clothes they had put on Friday morning.\n\n\"All we have is this and our smelly selves,\" he said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.1591737270355202, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 733, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.4629485789400003, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170108210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.18281036834925, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/30/graham-says-working-to-get-clemson-graduate-back-in-sc.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Graham says he's working to get Clemson graduate back in SC", "wordcount_as_scraped": 609, "date": "20170130210000", "story_content": "U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham said Monday that he expects President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily banning travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries to be modified, and he's working to get Nazanin Zinouri back to South Carolina \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nGraham told people at Zinouri's workplace in Clemson, South Carolina, that the 29-year-old Clemson University graduate \"is exactly the type of person we want to be part of America.\"\n\n\"She's a valid visa holder. She's paying taxes, and she's adding value to this business,\" he said at Modjoul, a startup technology firm where Zinouri has worked since August. \"She's intelligent. She adds value to our country, and I'll find a way to fix this problem.\"\n\nZinouri left Jan. 20 for what was supposed to be a three-week vacation to see family in Iran. After Trump signed Friday's order temporarily banning entry from citizens of Iran and six other nations, she says she tried to get back but was taken off a plane in Dubai.\n\n\"We've made a mistake,\" Graham said.\n\nWhile Trump can limit some people coming into the country, an executive order can't \"arbitrarily yank\" someone's existing legal status, he said.\n\n\"What I think happened here is, the executive order was issued without really thinking it through,\" Graham said. \"The mistake is lumping everybody in one big pot.\"\n\nZinouri was among those caught up in the chaos surrounding Trump's order regarding citizens from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen. The administration says it is necessary to keep out potential terrorists while stricter vetting procedures are put in place.\n\n\"I was planning on enjoying time with family and taking care of family business,\" Zinouri said Sunday in a phone interview with The Associated Press from Tehran. \"But I've not been able to do any of them. I'm mostly just listening to the news. ... I can't really focus or enjoy anything as much as I want. I can't even have a normal conversation.\"\n\nShe moved to the U.S. in August 2010 and got a master's degree from Northern Illinois University, then got a Ph.D. in industrial engineering last year on a full scholarship from Clemson University, where she won a prestigious research award.\n\nGraham said Zinouri's father died several years ago, but her mother and siblings still live in Tehran.\n\nShe was barely in Iran 48 hours when she began to hear rumblings that the United States might take action to prevent travel from some countries, so she began looking for flights home.\n\nBut flights out of Tehran were difficult to book because of snow. Her employer was working to get her back Friday but couldn't, said company founder Eric Martinez of Mercer Island, Washington, who described Zinouri as \"the smartest lady I know.\"\n\n\"It was actually really scary,\" Zinouri said. \"My mom was here crying. ... Fog and snow were everywhere. It was terrible. But I was still trying (to get out).\"\n\nEventually, she got as far as Dubai but wasn't allowed to continue on the flight to Washington, D.C.\n\nIn a statement, Zinouri sought public support for her return to the United States. \"My story will be much like others who dedicated their lives to their dream \u2014 the American dream \u2014 and whose intentions and lives were turned upside-down on Friday without notice or reason,\" she wrote.\n\nShe was able to return to her family in Tehran to wait out the situation and hope for the best.

Ryan Zinke told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee at his confirmation hearing.\n\n\"The climate is changing. The debate is what is that influence and what can we do,\" said the Montana Republican.\n\nTrump has suggested in recent weeks he's keeping an open mind on the issue and may reconsider a campaign pledge to back away from a 2015 Paris agreement that calls for global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn contradicting Trump, Zinke cited Glacier National Park in his home state as a prime example of the effects of climate change, noting that glaciers there have receded in his lifetime and even from one visit to the next.\n\nStill, he told Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that there is debate about how much humans have influenced the climate.\n\nLikely to win Senate confirmation, Zinke sketched out a variety of purposes for the nation's vast federal lands, from hiking, hunting, fishing and camping to harvesting timber and mining for coal and other energy sources.\n\nAn admirer of President Theodore Roosevelt, Zinke said management of federal lands should be done under a \"multiple-use\" model set forth by Gifford Pinchot, a longtime Roosevelt associate and the first chief of the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nZinke also pledged to tackle an estimated $12 billion backlog in maintenance and repair at national parks, saying parks and other public lands should be a key part of Trump's infrastructure improvement plan.\n\nZinke has said he would never sell, give away or transfer public lands -- a crucial stance in his home state of Montana and the rest of the West where access to hunting and fishing is considered sacrosanct.\n\nZinke feels so strongly that he resigned as a delegate to the Republican National Convention last summer because of the GOP's position in favor of land transfers to state or private groups. But Zinke's commitment to public lands has come into question in recent weeks.\n\nThe Interior Department and other U.S. agencies control almost a third of land in the West and even more of the underground \"mineral estate\" that holds vast amounts of coal, oil and natural gas.\n\nZinke's position on public lands came under fire after he voted in favor of a measure from House Republicans that would allow federal land transfers to be considered cost-free and budget-neutral, making it easier for drilling and development.\n\nZinke \"says he's against transfer of federal lands, but there's a big gap between what he says and what he does in that regard,\" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, the nation's oldest and largest environmental group.\n\nZinke told senators Tuesday that he flatly opposes all sales or transfer of federal lands.\n\nIndeed, his support for public lands was a crucial reason why Zinke was chosen by Trump. The president-elect and son Donald Trump Jr. both oppose sale of federal lands. The younger Trump, an avid hunter, has taken a keen interest in Interior Department issues and played a key role in Zinke's selection.\n\nZinke also reiterated his support for coal production on federal lands as part of an all-of-the above energy strategy\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, the top Democrat on the energy panel, asked Zinke about modernizing the federal coal program, saying it was important \"to make sure American taxpayers aren't short-changed for the benefit of corporate interests\n\nZinke promised to review the coal program and said he thinks taxpayers \"should always get fair value,\" whether it's coal, wind power or other energy sources.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.04011881351471, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 597, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.2672661660599998, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.51256281407035, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/04/netanyahu-calls-for-pardon-israeli-soldier-convicted-manslaughter.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [209, 346, 869, 946, 1623, 2648, 2788, 3426, 3727]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 691, "scraper_regex": 732}}, "headline": "Netanyahu calls for pardon of Israeli soldier convicted of manslaughter", "wordcount_as_scraped": 732, "date": "20170104200000", "story_content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday called for a pardon of the Israeli soldier convicted of manslaughter for shooting a\u00a0knife-wielding Palestinian attacker in the head, in a case that has deeply divided the country.\n\nSgt. Elor Azaria, an Israeli army medic\u00a0who had been deployed to the West Bank at the age of 19, shot and killed the Palestinian attacker who lay wounded and motionless on the ground -- nearly 15 minutes after he tried to stab a soldier in Hebron. Azaria's supporters claimed the military made him into a scapegoat.\n\nThe country's president, Reuven Rivlin, has authority to issue pardons but has said he would wait for the legal process to run its course before making a decision.\n\nISRAEL DISPATCHES SPY CHIEF FOR SECRET MEETING WITH TRUMP\n\n\"I urge the people of\u00a0Israel to support The Israeli Defense Forces. The soldiers are our daughters\u00a0and sons,\" Netanyahu wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe three-judge panel ruled earlier Wednesday, \"He opened fire in violation of orders, the terrorist did not pose any threat.\"\n\nIn delivering her ruling, Col. Maya Heller systematically rejected all of Azaria's defense arguments. \"There is no question that the defendant shot from close range after aiming his gun at the terrorist's head and there is no dispute that by doing so he endangered the lives of those around him,\" she wrote.\n\nISRAELI MOSSAD LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD WOMEN\n\nThe judges added that Azaria was \"aware\" his actions would result in the loss of life, and it was his bullet that killed the wounded Palestinian. Despite\u00a0Azaria's supporters claiming senior Israel Defense Forces leaders, politicians, the media or public opinion could influence the ruling, Heller emphasized that \"the verdict is based solely on the evidence brought forth (in the trial).\"\n\nAzaria's parents, Charlie and Oshra, left their home in Ramla in the early morning and arrived at the court for the verdict, greeted by hundreds of people who had turned up to stand in solidarity with the IDF sergeant.\n\nAs Azaria entered the courtroom, people nearby clapped their hands while calling out expressions of support: \"We love you and God loves you,\" they shouted.\n\nAzaria's defense team vowed to take the case to the military court of appeals. This could drag the trial out for at least four more months and even longer if another appeal is filed to the Supreme Court.\n\nMany Israeli lawmakers, both from the left and the right, called to pardon Azaria. Some claimed the legal process against him was \"contaminated from the onset.\" According to Jewish Home party leader Naftali\u00a0Bennett, \"today a soldier was convicted like a criminal for killing a terrorist who tried to slaughter soldiers.\"\n\nDefense Minister Avigdor\u00a0Lieberman responded, \"This is a severe verdict. I ask we all respect the court's ruling and show restraint. What is important \u2013 despite the harsh verdict \u2013 is that the defense establishments help the family and this soldier. I call on the public not to lambaste the IDF and the defense establishment. We must respect the ruling.\"\n\nDuring the verdict reading, which lasted two and a half hours, violent fights started outside of the court, and hundreds of right-wing demonstrators who supported Azaria blocked one of the main roads in Tel Aviv. Police arrested two people.\n\nThe shooting, which took place in the morning hours of March 24,\u00a02016, and the tense moments leading up to it, were captured on video by a Palestinian human rights activist. The video footage, distributed to news organizations, ensured that the incident, which came amid a wave of Palestinian stabbings, drew international attention. Azaria was indicted on April 18\u00a0by the military court.\n\nIn the face of strong condemnation of Azaria's actions by top military brass including IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot and then-defense minister Moshe Ya'alon, far-right supporters and some politicians have accused the defense establishment of abandoning one of its own.\n\nRight-wing politicians and some celebrities rallied behind Azaria. His actions, they claimed, were justified by the barrage of Palestinian violence and the general atmosphere of alarm in Hebron, a city where hundreds of Israeli settlers, under heavy army protection, live among some 200,000 Palestinians.\n\nOn the other side stood serving members of the military establishment. Many of them said Azaria, who made far-right, anti-Palestinian postings on Facebook before joining the military, acted in cold blood and outside protocol.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.7851037979126, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 691, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.6545002258599997, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.630969609261941, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/27/seeing-spartanburg-in-new-light.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3939]}}, "headline": "Seeing Spartanburg in a New Light", "wordcount_as_scraped": 636, "date": "20170127220000", "story_content": "In Spartanburg, South Carolina, we have witnessed the power of public art to bring people together.\n\nOn October 4, hundreds of people of all ages, all races and all walks of life, from 10 different neighborhoods across the city, stood together, seeing our community in a new way for the first time thanks to public art. They watched as nine new light installations were unveiled as part of \"Seeing Spartanburg in a New Light,\" an innovative project that is bringing residents together to reframe the way in which they see the city \u2013 and each other. As fireworks lit up the sky over the former mill village, it was impossible not to note the diversity present. Many of the people there had not visited this part of our city in a long time, if ever, and that is powerful.\n\nWhile the opening was a special moment in the history of our city, \"Seeing Spartanburg in a New Light\" is so much bigger than one night of celebration. In the wake of shootings and protests across the country, community-building between police officers and the municipalities they serve has become a focal point in our nation. Through \"Seeing Spartanburg in a New Light,\" Spartanburg police officers hoped to harness the power of public art to repair and strengthen police-community relations in the city. They also hoped to shine a light on Spartanburg's commitment to safety and vibrancy, enhance crime prevention efforts and cultivate partnerships that will help to increase public trust and confidence in local law enforcement.\n\nIn June 2015, the City of Spartanburg was selected as one of four projects nationwide to take part in Bloomberg Philanthropies Public Art Challenge, placing our city on the national and international public art stage. Then, for more than a year, digital media artist Erwin Redl, the Chapman Cultural Center, city police officers and the city's residents met, talked, listened and dreamed together.\n\nDuring this time, the project demonstrated how art and artists can help break down barriers. \"Seeing Spartanburg in a New Light\" allowed residents who have traditionally felt isolated from the arts to become part of the artistic process. The emphasis on collaboration also developed stronger relationships between residents and police officers, helping to overcome feelings of distrust and, we hope, making it more likely for residents to report suspicious activity.\n\nResidents from every neighborhood formed partnerships and worked toward a common purpose. As Police Chief Thompson said as he stood before the crowd on opening night, \"during the process of developing 'Seeing Spartanburg in a New Light,' residents representing neighborhoods throughout the city came together.

When that failed, the imam, an old family friend, put more pressure on Lubna to go to the Sharia court near London's Regent's Park.\n\nTo avoid shaming her devout Muslim mother Lubna agreed but the \"judges\" didn't care about the plight she'd suffered at her violent ex's hands and repeatedly told the young woman and her mother to be \"silent\".\n\nSpeaking to\u00a0the One Law for All campaign which is working to ban Sharia courts to improve Muslim women's rights, Lubna said: \"The court was incredibly difficult. My mother and I were repeatedly told to be silent. None of the information from the civil proceedings, including non-molestation orders, was admissible in the Sharia court.\n\n\"When my ex-husband said he wanted a reconciliation, the judges said I should comply.\n\n\"I tried to tell them about the violence and abuse I had suffered throughout the marriage, but was advised to be quiet.

She was also forced to disclose her address.\n\nAstonishingly however when Lubna's mum sought advice from Islamic scholars in Pakistan and India \u2013 they told her a civil divorce was sufficient to end the marriage.\n\nAs a result they never finished the Sharia divorce and the young Muslim went on to try and rebuild her life.\n\nFor more than 30 years\u00a0Sharia courts enforcing Islamic law have been operating quietly across Britain.

Gen. Michael Flynn on Friday accepted President-elect Donald Trump's offer to be his national security adviser, Fox News confirmed.\u00a0\n\nFlynn, who served as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) between 2012 and 2014, has advised Trump on national security issues for months. As national security adviser, he would work in the White House and have frequent access to the president.\n\nThe position does not require confirmation by the Senate. Whoever holds it is typically shielded from congressional requests to testify or produce documents.\n\nGENERAL VS. GENERAL: POWELL, FLYNN FEUD OVER HACKED EMAIL SLAMS\n\nAfter leaving the DIA, Flynn became a virulent critic of the Obama administration and the Pentagon.\u00a0He took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting ISIS and, more generally, its handling of global affairs.\n\nFlynn asserted that he had been forced out of the DIA because he disagreed with the administration's approach to combating extremism. His critics, however, claimed he had mismanaged the agency and that his efforts to force change had met with internal resistance.\n\n\nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at July's Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by ISIS requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow.\n\nFlynn is also a champion of renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal, another foreign policy theme Trump pushed during the campaign.\n\nBut Flynn's warmth toward Russia has worried some national security experts. Flynn traveled last year to Moscow, where he joined Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials in a celebration of the RT network, Russia's government-controlled television channel. Flynn later explained that he had been paid for taking part in the event, but brushed aside concerns that he was aiding a Russian propaganda effort.\n\n\nFlynn has also been outspoken in his alarms about the dangers of Islamist groups, complaining on CNN in June that the U.S. needs to \"discredit\" radical Islam, but that \"we're not allowed to do that right now.\" He blamed the Obama administration in a New York Post op-ed in July for failing to design a coherent strategy for opposing ISIS. And in August, he spoke at an event in Dallas for the anti-Islamist group Act for America, saying that Islam \"is a political ideology\" and that it \"definitely hides behind being a religion.\"\n\n\nFlynn's dark warnings about Islam have not extended to the Islamist-leaning authoritarian Turkish government headed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In an op-ed for the Washington newspaper The Hill just before the election, Flynn wrote that \"our ally Turkey\" needs support and echoed Erdogan's warnings that a \"shady\" Turkish leader now exiled in Pennsylvania should not be given safe harbor in the U.S. Erdogan has called for the extradition of the exile, Fethullah Gullen, but the Obama administration has made no move to comply.\n\n\nFlynn's military experience might have made him seem like a natural choice to lead the Pentagon. But without a waiver from Congress, he is not eligible to be secretary of defense because federal law says \"a person may not be appointed as secretary of defense within seven years after relief from active duty as a commissioned officer.\"\n\nTwo sources told Fox News earlier this week that Flynn's potential appointment is seen by Trump's team as a way to tap into his national security expertise, without subjecting him to intensive questioning.\n\nDuring the campaign, Flynn was thought of as a potential running mate for Trump. However, he appeared to fall out of favor after implying that he was pro-choice in a television interview.\n\nFLYNN CLARIFIES HIS ABORTION STANCE, SAYS HE'S 'PRO-LIFE'\n\nFlynn told ABC's \"This Week\" in July that women \"have to make the decision [on abortion] because they are the ones that are going to decide to bring up that child or not.\" The day after the interview aired, he told Fox News that he was a \"pro-life Democrat.\"\n\nWith his public and fervent support for Trump, highlighted by his July convention appearance, Flynn challenged the military's apolitical traditions. He was not alone in that role. John Allen, a retired Marine general, spoke at the Democratic National Convention as a Hillary Clinton supporter. Their former colleague, retired Gen. Martin Dempsey, wrote in The Washington Post that Flynn and Allen were wrong to have participated as they did.\n\n\n\"The military is not a political prize,\" Dempsey wrote. \"The American people should not wonder where their military leaders draw the line between military advice and political preference.\"\n\n\nFlynn would not be the first retired general to be asked to serve as part of a president's national security team. Obama appointed retired Army Gen. David Petraeus as CIA director in 2011.\n\n\nColin Powell, who had served as chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff at the pinnacle of his Army career, became secretary of state during President George W. Bush's first term. He also served as national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan from 1987 to 1989 while retaining his Army commission as a lieutenant general.\n\n\nRetired Marine Gen. James Jones, a former commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Europe, served as Obama's first national security adviser.\n\n\nFox News' Ed Henry and James Rosen and the Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.4622496068477629, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 604, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.801859144090001, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161118020000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.794701986754969, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/30/no-us-carrier-at-sea-leaves-gap-in-middle-east.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [798, 1258, 1337, 1412, 1826, 1904, 2321, 2396, 2484, 2736, 2804, 2888, 2931, 3004, 3482, 4027]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 765, "scraper_regex": 898}}, "headline": "No US carrier at sea leaves gap in Middle East", "wordcount_as_scraped": 898, "date": "20161230180000", "story_content": "For the next week, not only will there be no U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in the Middle East, but there will be no American aircraft carriers deployed at sea anywhere else in the world, despite a host of worldwide threats facing the United States.\n\nVIDEO: WHAT THE AIR FORCE NEEDS TO KEEP UP WITH GLOBAL DEMAND\n\nThe carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and her strike group returned to Norfolk, Va., Friday following a seven-month deployment. The Ike launched hundreds of airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria from both the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf.\n\nTwo destroyers in the Ike's strike group also saw combat. The USS Nitze and USS Mason were attacked in the Red Sea when Iranian backed Houthi forces in Yemen launched cruise misisles, which\u00a0were intercepted by the Mason. A retaliatory strike by the Nitze destroyed the radar installations in Yemen in October.\n\nIRAN CONDUCTS 'WAR-GAME' EXERCISES, THREATENS TO SHOOT DOWN TRESPASSING AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Eisenhower's replacement carrier, the USS George H.W. Bush, was delayed by more than six months in the shipyards and will not be able to replace the Ike until early next year, according to Navy officials.\n\nWhile there is no U.S. aircraft carrier in the\u00a0Middle East right now, there is a large deck U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship\u00a0with thousands of Marines on board as well as helicopters and some jets to\u00a0respond to a crisis, according to officials.\n\nIn the meantime, the Navy tells Fox News the U.S. military has other jets available to make up for the aircraft carrier gap in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world. The Navy can also \"surge\" a carrier now in port to deploy if necessary. But the absence of a deployed U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, long seen as a symbol of American power projection, is noteworthy.\u00a0It is believed to be the first time since World War II that at least one U.S.\u00a0aircraft carrier has not been deployed.\n\n\"We are not going to discuss the timing of operational movements of carrier strike groups into and out of the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility,\" said Capt. Terry Shannon, a U.S. Naval Forces Central Command spokesman, in a statement to Fox News. Centcom is tasked with control over all U.S. forces in the Middle East and Afghanistan.\n\nIt's not the first time there\u00a0was a carrier gap in the Middle East. Last fall, the U.S. Navy relied on a\u00a0French aircraft carrier to fill the void when the USS Theodore Roosevelt returned home.\u00a0At the time it was the first gap in carrier coverage in the Middle East since 2007.\n\nOther factors contribute to the U.S. Navy not having an aircraft carrier deployed anywhere in the world right now. From 2011 to 2013, the Navy maintained two carriers\u00a0in the Persian Gulf on the orders of Centcom's then-commander, Gen.\u00a0James Mattis, who is now President-elect Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary.\u00a0\n\nThe congressionally mandated budget cuts\u00a0known as sequestration have also been felt on the waterfront since 2011.\u00a0After billions of dollars were cut from the Navy's budget, ships such as the George H.W. Bush were forced to prolong their time in the shipyards, which had a ripple effect down the line. If the Bush had left the shipyard on time, she would have relieved the Ike in the Gulf or the Mediterranean, officials tell Fox News.\n\nFox News recently flew out to the USS George H.W. Bush 40 miles off the coast of North Carolina to see the crew's final tuneup.\n\nWith jets landing every 60\u00a0seconds, the flight deck crew worked on getting the time between \"traps\" (landings) down to 40 seconds.\n\nAboard the ship, 18- to 22-year-old men and women work 14 hour days on the flight deck, with little rest -- all this before deploying and potentially dropping live rounds on ISIS.\n\n\"This is the military equivalent of spring training, because once we complete this at the end of December, then we'll be going forward and it'll be real forces that we'll be going flying with and against,\" said Rear Adm. Kenneth Whitesell, commander, Carrier\u00a0Strike 2, interviewed on his perch above the four-acre flight deck known as \"Vulture's Row.\"\n\nIn addition to fighting ISIS, the ship's commanding officer says his crew will be ready to deal with a resurgent Russia or China if necessary.\n\n\"While we don't have any emergent or pending conflicts with them, certainly, it is fair to say that we have divergent interests in many cases. and so we need to be prepared to understand how we will react to that if necessary,\" said Capt. Will Pennington.\n\nThere is recent history with this ship.\n\nOn Aug. 8, 2014, a pair of F-18s from the Bush launched the first airstrikes against ISIS in northern Iraq.\n\nNow, two and a half years later, the ship is headed back to the fight against the Islamic State terror group.\n\n\"That doesn't mean that three months or six months from now, that will be the priority for our country. So we have to be ready to execute anywhere, anytime, any mission,\" said Capt. James McCall, commander of Air Wing 8, in charge of all of the aircraft on board.\n\nFox News' Stephen Scarola contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nLucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and State Department producer for Fox News Channel.

It had been converted to artists' studios and illegal living spaces, and former denizens said it was a death trap of piled wood, furniture, snaking electrical cords and only two exits.\n\nA refrigerator was a potential source of the fire, but it was too soon to say for sure, said Jill Snyder, special agent in charge of the San Francisco office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nSnyder said investigators were looking at \"anything electrical\" on the first floor of the warehouse near the origin of the blaze.\n\n\"We have no indication that this was intentionally set,\" she said.\n\nAlmena did not respond to emails or calls to phone numbers associated with him by The Associated Press. He told San Jose television station KNTV that he didn't attend the event Friday night and that he and his wife had decided to stay at a hotel because he was exhausted.\n\nCity and state officials fielded years of complaints about dangerous conditions, drugs, neglected children, trash, thefts and squabbles at the warehouse, raising questions about why it wasn't shut down. The district attorney warned of possible murder charges as she determines whether there were any crimes linked to the blaze.\n\nOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf released late Tuesday records from the city's planning and building department on the warehouse and adjacent lot that includes complaints going back to 2005.\n\n\"I am not prepared to draw conclusions from the history,\" Schaaf said. \"We are still in the process of compiling it.\"\n\nCrews had searched 90 percent of the building known as the \"Ghost Ship\" for bodies as of Tuesday afternoon and were expecting to complete the rest of the search by midnight.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, told the Associated Press it seems clear Artan was radicalized online.\n\nHe also said there doesn't seem to be much time between the onset of Artan's apparent radicalization and the attack, a period known in law enforcement and intelligence circles as \"flash to bang.\" That trend has disquieted law enforcement officials, who fear disaffected individuals are being inspired to violence after being only briefly exposed to radical ideology.\n\n\"This may be one of those cases which was just unpreventable,\" he said, adding that there was no evidence yet to suggest Artan had been publicly communicating radical intentions over a long period of time.\n\nHe said the fact that Artan may have been inspired by a cleric killed five years ago shows the \"limits of taking people off the battlefield.\"\n\n\"As long as you have disaffected or alienated young people who are searching for something to belong to, the lure of this radical propaganda will continue to be very dangerous,\" Schiff said.\n\nFox News' Catherine Herridge and the Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.30164527893066, "HarmVice": 12, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 506, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.2929887102199995, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161201010000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.33596837944664, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/14/final-wind-turbine-rule-permits-thousands-eagle-deaths.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [962, 3622]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 537, "scraper_regex": 568}}, "headline": "Final wind-turbine rule permits thousands of eagle deaths", "wordcount_as_scraped": 568, "date": "20161214200000", "story_content": "The Obama administration on Wednesday finalized a rule that lets wind-energy companies operate high-speed turbines for up to 30 years -- even if means killing or injuring thousands of federally protected bald and golden eagles.\n\nUnder the new rule, wind companies and other power providers will not face a penalty if they kill or injure up to 4,200 bald eagles, nearly four times the current limit. Deaths of the more rare golden eagles would be allowed without penalty so long as companies minimize losses by taking steps such as retrofitting power poles to reduce the risk of electrocution.\n\nThe new rule will conserve eagles while also spurring development of a pollution-free energy source intended to ease global warming, a cornerstone of President Barack Obama's energy plan, said Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe.\n\n\"No animal says America like the bald eagle,\" Ashe said in a statement. \u00a0He said the Fish and Wildlife Service is trying to balance energy development with eagle conservation.\n\nWind power has increased significantly since Obama took office, and wind turbines as tall as 30-story buildings are rising across the country. The wind towers have spinning rotors as wide as a passenger jet's wingspan, and blades reach speeds of up to 170 mph at the tips, creating tornado-like vortexes.\n\nThe surge in wind power has generally been well-received in the environmental community, but bird deaths -- and eagle deaths in particular -- have been a source of contention.\n\nThe birds are not endangered species but are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The laws prohibit killing, selling or otherwise harming eagles, their nests or eggs without a permit.\n\nIt's unclear what toll wind energy companies are having on eagle populations, although Ashe said as many 500 golden eagles a year are killed by collisions with wind towers, power lines, buildings, cars and trucks. Thousands more are killed by gunshots and poisonings.\n\nReporting of eagle mortality is voluntary, and the Interior Department refuses to release the information.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service estimates there are about 143,000 bald eagles in the United States, and 40,000 golden eagles. Ashe called recovery of the bald eagle \"one of our greatest national conservation achievements.\"\n\nThe rule is set to take effect in mid-January, days before Obama leaves office. President-elect Donald Trump could change the rule or scrap it, but the process would likely takes months or years.\n\nMichael Hutchins of the American Bird Conservancy said Wednesday that his group has \"some serious concerns\" that the new rule will not do not enough to sustain populations of threatened eagles.\n\nStill, Hutchins said, he is encouraged that the rule requires independent contractors to provide data on bird kills to the government, rather than allowing energy companies to submit the information. He also praised a requirement for greater public reporting of data on the numbers of birds killed by wind turbines.\n\nPermits issued by the government would be reviewed every five years, and companies would have to submit reports of how many eagles they kill.\n\nTom Kiernan, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association, said the industry was still reading the final rule, but said wind companies \"strongly support its core purpose -- eagle conservation.\"\n\nThe industry is working to further reduce what he said was a \"minimal impact\" it has on eagles in hopes of \"maintaining healthy eagle populations for generations to come,\" Kiernan said.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.9867550134658798, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 537, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 10, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.93736262207, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.9106145251396605, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/27/tennessee-knit-shop-owner-ask-womens-rights-marchers-to-shop-elsewhere.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 513, "scraper_regex": 541}}, "headline": "Tennessee knit shop owner ask women's rights marchers to 'shop elsewhere'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 541, "date": "20170127200000", "story_content": "A Tennessee knit shop owner is receiving backlash on social media after posting comments about the recent Women's March on Washington. \n\n In a Facebook post on January 24 , The Joy of Knitting owner Elizabeth Poe called the tone of the protest \"absolutely despicable\" and wrote \"I ask that [if you] want yarn for any project for the women's movement that you please shop for yarn elsewhere.\"\n\n Many Women's March on Washington participants wore so-called \"pussy-hats\" made from pink yarn. The hats were a reference to President Donald Trump's previous comments about grabbing women by the genitals. \n\n Poe says she does not want what she sees as \"vulgar, vile and evil\" rhetoric associated with her store\" in Franklin.\n\n \"As the owner of this business and a Christian,\" Poe continued, \"I have a duty to my customers and my community to promote values of mutual respect, love, compassion, understanding, and integrity.\"\n\n The Facebook post had over 12,000 comments as of Friday morning. The Tennessean reports Poe was initially reluctant to write the post but she became upset after hearing Madonna's speech and by what she saw some women wearing at the march in Washington, D.C. \n\n \"This is starting to undermine their efforts,\" Poe told the Tennessean. \"The topless women? I think if you want to get your point across you need to do it the right way and I just think that walking around dressed as a vulva is gross. Hatred is not acceptable speech.\"\n\n Although Poe's shop has received many negative reactions and boycott threats from Facebook users, she told Fox News she was very busy with orders from across the country. \n\n \"I am open for business and busier than a bee,\" Poe told Fox News via a Facebook message. \"Orders from all over the United States.

My [Planned Parenthood] donation is going to be in your name!\"\n\n Others took the opportunity to extend an olive branch to Poe. \n\n \"In spite of your feelings, you're welcome at the next march,\" one Facebook user responded. \"Because we value mutual respect, love, compassion, understanding and integrity.\"\n\n Poe told the Tennessean that she does not plan on deleting the Facebook post since she is pro-rights. \n\n \"I'm pro-rights, but I have to draw the line with the trajectory this movement has taken,\" Poe told the Tennessean. \"They're alienating their supporters.

The temperatures in Croatia's tourist centers of Dubrovnik and Split dropped to -7 C (19 F) and strong winds blew off ancient pine and olive trees on the coast.\n\nFerries and planes were grounded, and traffic over bridges banned.

A state of emergency was declared in the municipality of Kymi on the island of Evia, Greece's second largest island after Crete, where the snow in some areas reached two meters (6.5 feet), leading to cuts to electricity and water supplies.\n\nThe small eastern Aegean island of Oinousses reported severe problems from the heavy snowfall, with the local mayor telling Greek media the island had been without landline telephone connections for four days. On the island of Lesbos, drivers needed snow chains to drive just outside the main port town of Mytilene, while heavy snowfall also hit Chios and parts of the southern island of Crete, from where some flights to Athens were cancelled.\n\nChios and Lesbos are home to thousands of refugees, many living in precarious conditions in severely overcrowded camps. Many are still living in tents despite the severe weather. Rights groups have slammed the conditions and called on the Greek government to act quickly to reduce overcrowding.\n\n___\n\nITALY\n\nSchools were closed in a handful of southern Italy cities not accustomed to such heavy snowfall.

The inmates working on snow removal are doing so voluntarily, Firea said.\n\nShe said the initiative would help clean up the capital's ice-clogged streets, which are only partially cleared.\n\nRomania's Energy Minister Toma Petcu said neighboring Bulgaria had urgently asked for extra electricity, but the request was declined since the cold weather has stretched Romania's power grid.\n\nPetcu said natural gas consumption in Romania could reach an all-time high Monday due to the frigid temperatures.\n\n___\n\nRUSSIA\n\nIn Moscow, two people have died and 190 people with hypothermia have sought medical help in the Russian capital between New Year's Eve and Jan. 8, the last day of the holiday period in Russia, according to Russian news agencies quoting emergency medical official Sergei Gumenyuk.\n\nThe Russian Meteorological Service said the Orthodox Christmas Eve on Jan. 6 was the coldest in Moscow since 1987 when temperatures plunged below -31 C (-24 F). Moscow schools, however, opened on Monday after the holiday recess. In Russia's Urals, schools remained closed in the Tyumen, Khanty-Mansiysky, Sverdlovsk and Yamalo-Nenets regions where temperatures of -35 C (-31 F) were recorded.\n\n___\n\nSERBIA\n\nSerbian authorities have declared emergency measures in 11 municipalities in central and southern parts of the country as fresh snow and extremely low temperatures have blocked roads and cut off villages. Despite-28 C (-18 F), residents in remote villages on the rough Golija mountain have refused offers from authorities to evacuate their homes during the deep freeze because they won't abandon their animals.\n\nThe mostly elderly villagers said they'd rather freeze than abandon their sheep, goats, cows and chickens.\n\n\"We have wood and food for the animals,\" says Dragomir, one elderly resident. \"We'll wait.\"\n\n___\n\nSWITZERLAND\n\nPolice in the southern Swiss region of Valais say a Russian couple were killed and their two children aged 11 and 15 were gravely injured over the weekend after the vehicle they were travelling in tumbled about 225 meters (740 feet) along a snow-covered Alpine road.\n\nOfficials said the driver had been trying to park on the roadside, and snowy conditions appeared to have led to the deadly plunge into a pile of rocks. The two children were taken to a local hospital before being flown by helicopter to another in the capital, Bern. They were expected to survive, officials said.\n\n___\n\nTURKEY\n\nTurkish Airlines on Monday canceled 277 domestic and international flights to and from Istanbul's two airports due to heavy snow.

It will weigh a ton, swing smoothly\u2026and you'll hardly feel it go off.\n\nLight Loads: The most effective recoil reducer is a lighter, slower shotshell. An extra eighth of an ounce of shot or 100 fps of velocity increases recoil exponentially. Choose target ammunition with lighter, slower payloads, such as 1-ounce, 1180fps loads; or even Federal's 7/8-ounce, 1200 fps 12 gauge Top Gun load.\n\nIn a 20 gauge, Fiocchi's \u00be ounce Trainer load shoots very softly and is great for beginners. I handload 7/8- and \u00be-ounce 12 gauge loads, and always start new shooters with them.\n\nGun Weight: The heavier the gun, the less it recoils, which is one reason target guns, which are shot a great deal, weigh more than field guns, which are carried more and shot less. \"Gauge\" isn't part of the recoil equation, either. A heavy 12 gauge will recoil less than a light 20 gauge if both shoot similar loads. Often when middle school-age kids join our trap club, they bring short 20-gauge youth pumps that kick surprisingly hard because they are so light. I'll often put an 8 \u00bd-pound 12-gauge trap gun in their hands and watch them start hitting targets right away. The reduction in recoil is significant. If your primary use for a shotgun will be target shooting, or waterfowling or dove hunting, where guns are carried very little, don't be afraid to buy a heavier gun.\n\nMARINES TESTING RIFLES WITH SUPPRESSORS\n\nWeighted magazine caps Available for a variety of pump and semiautos, weighted caps replace the factory cap to add up to half a pound of weight to the front of the gun, reducing recoil and muzzle rise, while also smoothing your swing. Briley Manufacturing and Graco offer both caps for several guns as well as weights that clamp onto a gun's barrel for about $50.\n\nStock-mounted recoil reducers: Adding up to a pound to the weight of a gun once installed in the stock, these reducers can sometimes be dropped in, while in other guns they need to be installed by a gunsmith. Graco sells the BreakO reducer for $55-$65.\n\nGas-operated semiautomatic action: After light loads, gas semiautos are the most effective recoil reducers. Gas semiautos generate the same recoil as other types of guns, but because recoil is stored, then released, by the gun's internal moving parts, that recoil is spread out over a longer time. It feels more like a push than a punch. The Remington VersaMax and 1100/11-87 are the softest-shooting gas guns I've tried, with the Browning Maxus and Silver following next.\n\nSoft Comb: A gunsmith can add a soft comb to a wood stock. There are also inexpensive comb pads that stick onto your stock, although those will raise the stock dimensions. A few factory guns like the Remington Versa Max and several Benellis come with factory soft combs. Otherwise it costs about $225 to have a gunsmith add one to your shotgun.\n\nBarrel Ports: Barrel ports vent some of the expanding gasses up and out of the barrel, reducing muzzle rise. Ports help keep a gun recoiling back into your shoulder instead of up into your face. Some guns come with factory ports, while a number of companies can cut ports in a barrel. Mag-na-Port, the original port cutter, charges $100 for a single barrel and $155 for an over/under.\n\nPUMP SHOTGUNS FOR LESS THAN $300: GUN REVIEW\n\nRecoil pad: High performance recoil pads, both factory and aftermarket, are a big improvement over the standard hard rubber buttpad found on many guns. Both pre-fit and grind-to-fit pads are available. There are several good brands available, such as KickEez and the Pachmayr Decelerator, but Sims Limbsavers offer the most pre-fit choices. They cost about $40, and having one installed by a gunsmith, who will grind the pad to fit, usually costs $50-$60.\n\nA soft pad is probably the best recoil reducer in terms of return on investment. They don't cost much and they really work.\n\nCompression Butt Plate: A shock absorber on the butt of your gun, a compression butt pad gives under recoil, and then springs back, dampening the shock to your shoulder. Remington's Competition 1100 and Beretta's A400 Xcel come with factory-mounted compression plates. You can buy an aftermarket Jack West stock, which comes with a compression butt plate, for your 1100 or 870 for about $400. Or you can have a Gracoil, SoftTouch, or Bump Buster installed on your gun, starting around $450.\n\nGun Fit: A gun that fits its owner will kick less. A stock that's comfortable to handle but not so short it drives the shooter's knuckles into his or her nose is a good start. So is a buttpad shaped and angled so it doesn't dig into the shooter's chest. The angle of the butt is called \"pitch.\" Many women find a stock with the toe angled out slightly to be more comfortable. Left-handed shooters should be aware that many European stocks come \"cast off\" or bent to the side for right handed shooters, which can increase felt recoil for lefties. (You can tell if your shotgun has cast by looking straight down its length, upside down, and seeing if the stock is bent one way or the other.) Altering a stock's length or pitch is easily done when having a pad installed. Changing cast can cost $150 and up. Many popular semiautomatics now come with shims than allow owners to easily adjust cast and drop.\n\nLengthened Forcing Cone: Lengthening or \"relieving\" the forcing cone, the taper between the chamber and the bore, eases the transition of shot from the shell into the barrel and many believe lengthened cones make a gun kick more softly. Some new factory guns, such as Browning shotguns that feature VectorPro, come with forcing cones already lengthened. Lengthening forcing cones costs $80-$100 per barrel.\n\nShoulder pads: a padded shooting vest, or even a separate wearable pad like the PAST pad, provides an extra cushion for your shoulder for about $30.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.60360360145569, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1149, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 0.881396337712, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 4, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161201170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.348128807658834, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.363636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/08/pizza-shop-gunman-life-showed-recent-signs-turbulence.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [76]}}, "headline": "Pizza shop gunman's life showed recent signs of turbulence", "wordcount_as_scraped": 775, "date": "20161208090000", "story_content": "SALISBURY, N.C. \u2013 \u00a0The man accused of firing an assault rifle inside a Washington restaurant appears to have lived an aimless life that became turbulent in the weeks before he was drawn to the nation's capital by a fake news story.\n\nFriends and family say Edgar Maddison Welch is a well-meaning father of two girls who wanted to be a firefighter. But he also unnerved some with his religious fervor and sometimes had trouble detaching himself from the internet.\n\nPolice say he came to the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant Sunday on a self-imposed mission to investigate a false account of a child sex ring that had spread through fake internet news stories.\n\nIn the weeks before his Washington arrest, there were other signs of turbulence. In late October, the 28-year-old struck a teenage pedestrian with his car in his hometown of Salisbury, North Carolina, requiring the boy to be airlifted to a hospital, according to a police report that said he wasn't immediately charged. More recently, days before he drove to Washington, he was dropped from the rolls of a volunteer fire department.\n\nIn past years, he was convicted of drunken driving and minor drug charges.\n\nBut the one constant, friends and family say, was his love for his two young daughters.\n\n\"He's a father and a very loving man, very concerned about children,\" said his aunt Tajuana Tadlock, adding: \"He's not a vigilante, by no check of the words.\"\n\nTadlock said Welch's parents haven't been able to talk to him to ask what he was thinking, and the family's only information comes from the news and the public defender.\n\nIn Washington, court documents say Welch fired an AR-15 rifle multiple times inside the restaurant but later exited with his hands up. He told police \"he had read online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves,\" and he wanted to investigate. He said he surrendered when he found no signs of children being held. Welch faces charges including assault with a dangerous weapon, and is due in court Thursday.\n\nIn recent years, Welch often mentioned his Christian faith. Interspersed with Facebook posts about his daughters are the registered Republican's musings on the Bible and religion.\n\nDanielle Tillman of Raleigh said she met Welch a few months ago and has known his current girlfriend for years. She recalls Welch made her uncomfortable while talking at length about religion. At one point, he grabbed her hand and prayed, asking for \"the demons to come out of me,\" she said.\n\nWelch's family has roots in the Salisbury area, where his father and grandfather served in local government, according to the Salisbury Post. Friends say he attended West Rowan High School. A woman at the family's property declined to answer questions this week.\n\nAround age 18, Welch pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drug possession charges in neighboring Cabarrus County, according to online records of the January 2007 offense.\n\nWelch enrolled at Cape Fear Community College in Wilmington, but court records say he didn't graduate.\n\nOn a break from college in 2009, Welch was interviewed by the Salisbury Post after he made it halfway through a hike of the 500-mile Colorado Trail. He told the newspaper the hike helped him overcome an addiction to the internet.\n\n\"It's a good feeling, going solo,\" he told the newspaper. \"There's something spiritual about it.\"\n\nIn April 2013, Welch was charged with impaired driving with a blood-alcohol content of .09, court records show. He pleaded guilty, was sentenced to probation and community service and underwent alcohol counseling.\n\nRowan County records show that after a short marriage, his wife filed for divorce in November 2014. The thin file doesn't say why they split up. The divorce complaint was dismissed in 2015 after neither attended a scheduled hearing. Documents related to his arrest say they remain separated, and his two children live with him.\n\nWelch twice served briefly as a volunteer firefighter, and his aunt said he was recently taking classes needed to get a paying job as a firefighter.\n\nLocke Fire Chief Rusty Alexander said Welch barely showed up at the fire station after joining in 2012, and lasted about six months.\n\n\"He tried it, and basically it wasn't for him,\" Alexander said.\n\nIn May 2016, Welch became a volunteer firefighter in the town of Spencer, Chief Gray Grubb said. Grubb said Welch stopped attending training sessions and didn't answer alarms, so he was removed from the active roster Nov. 30.\n\n\"When we interviewed him, he seemed like a good guy,\" Grubb said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jessica Gresko and Sarah Brumfield in Washington and Martha Waggoner in Raleigh, North Carolina, contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.10328054428101, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 761, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.34743315267, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161208090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.41655716162943, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2016/11/07/still-undecided-look-at-where-clinton-and-trump-stand-on-issues/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1429]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1512, "scraper_regex": 1645}}, "headline": "Still undecided? A look at where Clinton and Trump stand on the issues", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1645, "date": "20161107200000", "story_content": "As Fox News Channel's Chris Wallace pointed out during the final presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, \"There are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.\"\n\nFrom immigration and national security to healthcare and racial issues, the differences between the Democratic and Republican nominees couldn't be more pronounced. But if you're still undecided about whom to vote for \u2013 yes, there are a few of you out there \u2013 here's quick rundown of where the major party candidates stand on the issues.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nThe future of millions of people living in the U.S. without documentation will be shaped by the election results. The stakes are also high, too, for those who fight the scourge of illegal drugs like heroin and crystal meth in the U.S.\n\nFrom the moment that Trump announced his candidacy for the presidency, he has prioritized getting control of the U.S. border with Mexico to limit the amount of drugs and undocumented migrants who enter the country.\n\nThe real estate tycoon pledged to build a wall along the border and get the Mexican government to pay for it. He also vowed to form an army to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, although he has lately been talking about focusing deportation efforts on people who have committed crimes beyond their immigration offenses.\u00a0\n\nClinton, in contrast, intends to overhaul immigration laws to include a path to citizenship, not just legal status.\n\nDuring the campaign, she has vowed to press forward with the immigration executive actions that President Barack Obama began, but which got stalled out in a 4-4 Supreme Court deadlock. Those actions promised to give deportation protection to millions of undocumented people who came to the country when young or who have children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status here.\n\nTRADE\n\nIn this angry election year, many American voters are skeptical about free trade \u2014 or hostile to it.\n\nThe backlash threatens a pillar of U.S. policy: The United States has long sought global trade.\n\nEconomists say imports cut prices for consumers and make the U.S. more efficient.\n\nBut unease has simmered, especially as American workers faced competition from low-wage Chinese labor. Last year, the U.S. ran a $334 billion trade deficit with China \u2014 $500 billion with the entire world.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican presidential candidates are both playing to public suspicions about trade deals. Clinton broke with Obama by opposing an Asia-Pacific trade agreement that she had supported as secretary of state.\n\nTrump vows to tear up existing trade deals and to slap huge tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nBut trade deals have far less impact on jobs than forces such as automation and wage differences between countries. Trump's plans to impose tariffs could start a trade war and raise prices.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nThe U.S. has some 50 million K-12 students. Teaching them, preparing them for college and careers, costs taxpayers more than $580 billion a year, or about $11,670 per pupil per year. A better education usually translates into higher earnings.\n\nAnd while high school graduations are up sharply and dropout rates down, the nation has a ways to go to match the educational outcomes elsewhere. American schoolchildren trail their counterparts in Japan, Korea, Germany, France and elsewhere.\n\nClinton wants to make preschool universal for all 4-year-old children within 10 years by providing new federal dollars to states. Trump proposes to spend $20 billion during his first year in office to help states expand school choice programs. He wants states to divert an additional $110 billion of their own education money to help parents who want their children to go to other schools.\n\nEXECUTIVE AUTHORITY\n\n\"Your Majesty\" isn't in the American political lexicon. But when a president sets a major policy by edict, skirting Congress, it sets off a debate that traces back to the time of kings and queens \u2014 and the Founding Fathers, who rejected the authority of the crown. Lawmakers cry foul when a president, especially of the other party, usurps their authority through executive action. Defenders say it can be the only way to get something done when Congress is gridlocked.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has used executive authority expansively, most notably on immigration.\n\nTrump says he'd make sure Obama's \"unconstitutional actions\" never come back. But some Republicans worry Trump, too, might pursue an \"imperial presidency.\" Clinton supported Obama's unilateral move to curb deportation of millions of immigrants in the U.S. country illegally. The Supreme Court deadlocked in June over the major portion of the immigration executive actions, effectively killing the plan for the rest of Obama's presidency.\n\nFOREIGN POLICY\n\nHow the U.S. uses its influence as the world's sole superpower is a central feature of presidential power.\n\nIt can mean taking the country to war \u2014 to protect the homeland or to defend an ally. Or it can mean using diplomacy to prevent war. It can affect U.S. jobs, too, as choices arise either to expand trade deals or to erect barriers to protect U.S. markets.\n\nIn the contest between Clinton and Trump, America's role in the world is a point of sharp differences. Each says the U.S. must be the predominant power, but they would exercise leadership differently. Trump calls his approach \"America first,\" meaning alliances and coalitions would not pass muster unless they produced a net benefit to the U.S. Clinton sees international partnerships as essential tools for using U.S. influence and lessening the chances of war.\n\nThese divergent views could mean very different approaches to the military fight and ideological struggle against the Islamic State, the future of Afghanistan and Iraq, the contest with China for influence in Asia and the Pacific, and growing nervousness in Europe over Russian aggression.\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nAbout 9 in 10 Americans now have health insurance, more than at any time in history. But progress is incomplete, and the future far from certain. Rising costs could bedevil the next occupant of the White House.\n\nMillions of people previously shut out have been covered by President Barack Obama's health care law. No one can be denied coverage anymore because of a pre-existing condition. But \"Obamacare\" remains divisive, and premiums for next year are rising sharply in many communities. As well, some major insurers are leaving the program.\n\nWhether Americans would be better off trading for a GOP plan is another question. Recent studies found Trump's proposal would make 18 million to 20 million people uninsured. GOP congressional leaders have a more comprehensive approach, but key details are still missing.\n\nOverall health care spending is trending higher again, and prices for prescription drugs \u2014 new and old \u2014 are a major worry.\n\nMedicare's insolvency date has moved up by two years \u2014 to 2028.\n\nClinton would stay the course, adjusting as needed. Republicans are united on repealing Obama's law, but it's unclear how they would replace it.\n\nJOBS\n\nTepid income growth and a smaller share of the population at work have kept many Americans anxious about jobs and the economy, seven years after the Great Recession ended.\n\nAnd most jobs that pay decent wages require more education than in the past, leaving many workers feeling left behind.\n\nTrump says he would cut regulations and taxes to spur more hiring, and renegotiate or withdraw from trade agreements to bring jobs back to the U.S.\n\nClinton says she would spend more on roads, tunnels, and other infrastructure and make state colleges and universities tuition free to most students.\n\nEven though hiring has been healthy for the past six years, incomes have lagged. A typical household didn't see its income recover to pre-recession levels until just this past July. And the proportion of Americans working or looking for work remains below pre-recession levels, as some of the unemployed have given up searching for jobs.\n\nRACE and POLICING\n\nThe continued deaths of unarmed African-Americans at the hands of police are turning into one of the most consequential civil rights issues of the new millennium. Since the death in 2014 of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the sharing of video-recorded deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement has sparked unrest in many cities around the country, and prompted calls for additional training and more monitoring of police forces.\n\nClinton has offered specific proposals, including legislation that would help end racial profiling, providing federal matching funds for more police body cameras and overhauling mandatory minimum sentencing.\n\nTrump has described himself as the \"law and order\" candidate, and has not specifically addressed plans on race and policing. He endorsed a former New York City police policy called \"stop and frisk\" after unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, over the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott.\n\nVOTING RIGHTS\n\nVoting rights in America are in flux. Republican-controlled legislatures are tightening voter laws, placing limits on early voting and same-day registration, and imposing new requirements for IDs at polling places. In 2013, the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. That provision had required states with a history of racial discrimination to get federal preclearance to change election laws.\n\nThe issue has become highly partisan with the rapid growth of minority populations, which in recent presidential elections have tilted heavily Democratic. And it has become overlaid with Trump's statements that the election is rigged against him and that he might not accept defeat at the polls.\n\nThe Obama Justice Department has challenged voter ID and other laws, saying they could restrict access for minorities and young people. Federal court rulings softened some of the toughest restrictions, but litigation remains knotted up with Supreme Court appeals underway. Bills in Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act are stalled.\n\nTrump opposes same-day voter registration. Clinton wants Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act and seeks a national standard of at least 20 days of early in-person voting.\n\nBased on reporting by the Associated Press.\n\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.53356885910034, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1512, "FairnessVirtue": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 16, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.7115121890400005, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 8, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 6, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 63, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161107200000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 5.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 4.16666666666667, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/10/exclusive-adm-harris-says-duty-is-serve-president-trump-or-otherwise.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [231, 536, 1374, 2727, 2893, 3228, 3354, 3355, 3686, 3689]}}, "headline": "Exclusive: Adm.

Harry Harris is the top military officer in the Pacific Ocean theater but still has bosses -- namely President Obama and the secretary of defense.\u00a0And while the men in those positions will soon change, Harris makes clear that his military duty is to follow their orders.\n\n\"I work for the commander in chief, who is President Obama, until the 20th of January, then my commander in chief will be President Trump,\" Harris said matter of factly on Monday.\u00a0 \"And I look forward to working for him.\"\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with Fox News, Harris, who leads all U.S. forces as head of Pacific Command, also shared his assessment of the many hot spots under his watch throughout that region.\n\nSpeaking just outside his Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, headquarters, Harris was quick to note the directives from Washington that guide his stewardship of a sometimes volatile region.\n\nIt's a role that requires him to pull from his background as a Navy pilot to execute complicated military movements, while also drawing upon a mix of diplomatic acumen, economic understanding and the flexibility to adjust to geopolitical realties.\n\nHarris readily calls attention to Defense Secretary Ash Carter's determination that Russia, China, North Korea, Iran and terrorism are the five main global pressure points.\u00a0\n\n\"My biggest concern -- imminent concern-- is North Korea,\" he said. \"As I've said before, Russia and China are existential threats to the United States. And both are countries in the Indo-Asia Pacific. And both are in Secretary Carter's list of five-problem sets. North Korea is in that problem set ... the most imminent threat that I face today.\"\n\nA significant reason for that concern is what Harris describes as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's unpredictability. He notes the weaponry already pointed toward the United States and its regional allies, combined with the regime's unbridled nuclear ambitions.\n\n\"So he's a very real threat today,\" he said.\n\nWhile not minimizing the threats posed by China and Russia, Harris describes each as responsible powers. Harris thinks that Russia and China -- unlike North Korea -- can be responsive to normal modes of diplomacy.\n\nAn example of this, perhaps, is China's reaction to a recent adverse ruling by an international tribunal about the construction of islands doubling as military outposts in the South China Sea. China had claimed sovereign rights to the water.\n\nHarris said he's seen China \"lower its rhetoric\" in the months since the decision.\n\n\"So we'll have to see what it means in the long run,\" he also said.\n\nIran is the only named global concern that falls outside of the admiral's domain.\u00a0\n\nAs for terrorism, Harris says there are thousands of ISIS fighters in the Middle East who come from countries like Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia and Bangladesh.\u00a0\n\n\"At some point they're going to want to go home -- those who are still alive -- and they will want to come back,\" Harris predicts. \"It's a very real concern to me .... because they're right there in my backyard.\"\n\nHarris would not offer further comment on Trump, including the president-elect's recent use of Twitter to taunt China.\u00a0\n\n\"It sounds like you're asking me to grade the president-elect's homework,\" he told a reporter. \"I'm not going to do that.\" \u00a0\u00a0\n\nHowever, Harris praised retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, whom Trump wants as his Secretary of defense and who with Trump would become Harris's new boss.\n\n\"I supported him in the beginning on Operation Enduring Freedom, and I think highly of him,\" Harris said. \"I think he's going to be an extraordinary secretary of defense.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.8439716100692702, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 582, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.9112541856, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161210190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.4054982817869397, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/24/trump-signs-orders-reviving-pipeline-projects.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [394, 1225, 3847, 5261]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 700, "scraper_regex": 813}}, "headline": "Trump signs orders reviving pipeline projects, TransCanada says it will reapply for Keystone", "wordcount_as_scraped": 813, "date": "20170124180000", "story_content": "President Trump signed executive orders on Tuesday effectively reviving the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, as a major builder said it will reapply to build one of the projects which had been stalled by the Obama administration under pressure from environmental and other groups.\u00a0\n\nThe president said the projects would be subject to a \"renegotiation of the terms.\" But he made clear the government was resuming consideration for both pipelines, describing them as a potential boon to construction workers.\n\n\"We're going to put a lot of \u2026 steel workers back to work,\" Trump said. \"We'll build our own pipelines, we will build our own pipes.\"\n\nBuilder TransCanada said Tuesday afternoon it was \"preparing the application\" for the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\n\"We appreciate the President of the United States inviting us to re-apply for KXL,\" TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said in a statement.\n\n\"KXL creates thousands of well-paying construction jobs and would generate tens of millions of dollars in annual property taxes to counties along the route as well as more than $3 billion to the U.S. GDP,\" Cunha added.\u00a0\n\nAccording to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Trump directed agencies to approve it without delay -- and told agencies to expedite reviews and approvals for the remaining parts of the Dakota project.\n\n\"There's an energy revolution that's going to happen in this country,\" he said.\n\nThe president also signed three other orders related to pipeline construction, including one expediting the environmental permitting process for infrastructure projects and one directing the Commerce Department to maximize the use of U.S. steel.\n\nLooking ahead, Trump also announced he planned to nominate a justice for the Supreme Court next week, moving swiftly to try to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The president was summoning top senators to the White House later Tuesday to discuss his upcoming nomination.\n\nThe moves on the pipelines had been widely expected, as Trump last year blasted his predecessor for effectively blocking the projects.\n\nRepublican allies hailed Tuesday's orders, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying in a statement, \"It's about time.\"\n\nNorth Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer said: \"Today's executive orders affirm President Trump's respect for the rule of law and his support for responsible infrastructure development, energy production and job creation.\"\n\nFormer President Obama stopped the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in late 2015, declaring it would have undercut U.S. efforts to clinch a global climate change deal that was a centerpiece of his environmental legacy. The pipeline would run from Canada to Nebraska where it would connect to existing lines running to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. The U.S. government needs to approve the pipeline because it would cross the nation's northern border.\n\nSeparately, late last year, the Army Corps of Engineers declined to allow construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe, saying alternative routes needed to be considered. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters say the project threatens drinking water and Native American sites, though Energy Transfer Partners, the company that wants to build the pipeline, disputes that and says the pipeline will be safe.\n\nThe pipeline is to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. The project had been the subject of fierce protests until the Army Corps of Engineers stepped in.\n\nThe moves are likely to spark a new fight with environmentalists. Even before Trump's orders were official, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune put out a statement blasting what he called the \"dangerous\" decision. \u00a0\n\n\"The Keystone pipeline was rejected because it was not in the country's interest, and the environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline was ordered because of the threats it poses to the Standing Rock Sioux. Nothing has changed. These pipelines were a bad idea then and they're a bad idea now,\" he said.\n\nThe moves come as Trump makes the economy and jobs the centerpiece of his administration's first week in office.\n\nHe met Tuesday morning with representatives from the auto industry including GM and Ford, after meeting a day earlier, separately, with business and union leaders.\n\nThe pipelines were among the few issues that put the Obama administration at odds with labor unions, some of whom have voiced hope the Trump administration can work with them to promote job creation. Trump said Tuesday during his meeting with auto industry bosses that he considers himself an environmentalist, but called current regulations \"out of control.\"\n\nThe pipeline orders follow earlier executive actions covering everything from trade to ObamaCare.\n\nTrump on Monday signed measures withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and instituting a hiring freeze for most of the federal government. He also ordered federal agencies on his first day in office to ease the regulatory burden of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFox News' John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.401606440544128, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 700, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 14, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.91014784866, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5714285714285694, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/01/un-chief-fires-general-in-south-sudan-after-harsh-report-on-military.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [85]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 504, "scraper_regex": 553}}, "headline": "UN chief fires general in South Sudan after harsh report on military", "wordcount_as_scraped": 553, "date": "20161101210000", "story_content": "UNITED NATIONS \u2013 \u00a0Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon fired the commander of the peacekeeping force in South Sudan on Tuesday after an independent investigation sharply criticized the military response to deadly attacks in July on a U.N. compound housing 27,000 displaced people.\n\nBLOOD AND WAR: HOW A UNITED NATIONS AGENCY COOPERATES WITH ASSAD\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric announced the dismissal of Kenyan Lt. Gen. Johnson Mogoa Kimani Ondieki shortly after the investigators' report was released, saying the U.N. chief was \"deeply distressed\" by the findings.\n\nSouth Sudan, the world's youngest country, has been riven by ethnic violence since shortly after gaining its independence from Sudan in 2011. Civil war broke out in 2013 when government forces loyal to President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battled rebels led by his former vice president Riek Machar, who is a Nuer. A peace agreement was signed in August 2015, but fighting, that has left tens of thousands dead and more than 2 million displaced, continues.\n\nA confidential U.N. report obtained by The Associated Press in September said the deadly fighting in July was directed by the highest levels of Kiir's government. Among the targets were the U.N. peacekeeping base known as UN House and the adjacent camp where some 27,000 displaced civilians, who are Nuer, had sought safety and the Terrain Camp, a private compound just 0.6 miles away where U.N. staff, aid workers and local staff were housed.\n\nRUSSIA VOTED OFF UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL\n\nThe report said \"a lack of leadership on the part of key senior mission personnel culminated in a chaotic and ineffective response to the violence\" at UN House and the compound for displaced civilians.\n\n\"The force did not operate under a unified command, resulting in multiple and sometimes conflicting orders to the four troop contingents from China, Ethiopia, Nepal and India, and ultimately underusing the more than 1,800 infantry troops at UN House,\" it said.\n\nIn three days of fighting in July, at least 73 people were killed including more than 20 internally displaced people who had sought U.N. protection. Two Chinese peacekeepers were among those killed and several were wounded; 182 buildings on the UN House compound were struck by bullets, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, and thousands of internally displaced people fled into UN House, the report said.\n\nThe report said confusing senior leadership and the lack of leadership on the ground, where the Chinese battalion commander had been appointed as the incident commander, \"contributed to incidents of poor performance among the military and police contingents at UN House.\"\n\nThis included \"at least two instances in which the Chinese battalion abandoned some of its defensive positions\" and an \"inadequate\" performance by Nepalese police to stop looting inside UN House by some displaced people and control the crowd, it said.\n\nThe investigators also criticized the U.N. mission and its peacekeepers for failing to respond to the attack on the Terrain Camp, where U.N. staff, aid workers and local staff were robbed, beaten, raped and killed by armed soldiers.\n\nThe report said peacekeepers and international police were \"risk-averse.\"\n\nThe investigators, led by retired Dutch Maj. Gen. Patrick Cammaert, recommended that \"peacekeepers, commanders and relevant troop contributing countries should be held accountable for failures to protect\" civilians.\n\nDujarric, the U.N. spokesman, told reporters that Ban asked \"for the immediate replacement of the force commander.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.896551609039309, "HarmVice": 12, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 504, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.574452954690001, "HarmVirtue": 12, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161101210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 7.142857142857139, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/03/former-us-ambassador-cotton-back-trump-on-taiwan-call-after-immediate-backlash-criticism.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4697]}}, "headline": "Former US ambassador, Cotton back Trump on Taiwan call, after immediate backlash, criticism", "wordcount_as_scraped": 685, "date": "20161203170000", "story_content": "After criticism about Donald Trump talking with Taiwan's leader jeopardizing U.S.-China relations, Beijing and a former American ambassador suggested Saturday that Americans have perhaps overacted and that the president-elect's willingness to talk with isolated world leaders doesn't signal a dangerous foreign policy shift.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the call was \"just a small trick by Taiwan\" and that he didn't think it would change U.S. foreign policy toward China, according to Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.\n\nThe conversation Friday between Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and Trump, a first-time elected official with no official foreign policy experience, indeed broke with decades-long diplomatic tradition.\n\nWashington has pursued a so-called \"one China\" policy since 1979, when it shifted diplomatic recognition of China from the government in Taiwan to the communist government on the mainland.\n\nUnder that policy, the United States recognizes Beijing as representing China but retains unofficial ties with Taiwan.\n\nWang also expressed hope Saturday that the call would not \"damage\" or \"interfere with\" Washington-Beijing relations.\n\nThat Trump might speak directly with Taiwan's leader is not a huge surprise, considering how during the campaign season he extolled the leadership of Russian President Vladimir Putin and called for a tempered approach to diplomatic relations with the former Cold War rival.\n\nAnd since winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has apparently undertaken calls with other foreign leaders without guidance customarily lent by the State Department, which oversees U.S. diplomacy.\n\nOn Friday, Trump also took a call from Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has criticized outgoing President Obama and the State Department for raising concerns over his crackdown on illegal drug dealing.\n\nDuterte, who took office in June, has been antagonistic to the U.S., his country's treaty ally, while reaching out to China and Russia. And he has met Chinese President Xi Jinping twice and Putin once.\n\nJohn Huntsman, a former American ambassador to China and Utah Republican governor, on Saturday suggested Trump's call to Taiwan and other such diplomatic outreaches \"should be expected,\" with Trump being perhaps the most unconventional presidential candidate of a generation.\n\n\"We ought to be giving (Taiwan) a little more space,\" Huntsman said on Fox News, noting mutual economic, national security and human rights issues.\n\nArkansas GOP Sen.

Thank you!\"\n\nHowever, The Taipei Times is reporting that the Trump team orchestrated the call.\n\nA statement from Trump's transition team said Tsai during the call offered her congratulations to the president-elected.\n\nThe statement also said the two leaders discussed their \"close economic, political, and security ties\" and that Trump, a Republican, congratulated Tsai on becoming president of Taiwan earlier this year.\n\nThe Taiwanese presidential office issued a statement early Saturday saying Trump and Tsai discussed issues affecting Asia and the future of U.S. relations with Taiwan.\n\n\"The (Taiwanese) president is looking forward to strengthening bilateral interactions and contacts as well as setting up closer cooperative relations,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The president also told U.S. President-elect Trump that she hopes the U.S. will continue to support Taiwan's efforts in having more opportunities to participate in and contribute to international affairs in the future,\" Tsai's office said.\n\nThe White House learned of the conversation after it had taken place, said a senior Obama administration official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive diplomatic relations involved.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.131061598658562, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 695, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.08287726506, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161203170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.1726618705036005, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/27/ny-ag-trump-cant-dissolve-foundation-during-investigation.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "NY AG: Trump can't dissolve foundation during investigation", "wordcount_as_scraped": 629, "date": "20161227160000", "story_content": "Donald Trump cannot move ahead with his plan to dismantle his charitable foundation because state prosecutors are probing whether the president-elect personally benefited from its spending, the New York attorney general's office said Tuesday.\n\n\"The Trump foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,\" said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.\n\nThe statement came after Trump announced that he wanted to dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation, part of what his presidential transition team says is an effort to erase any potential conflicts of interest before he takes office Jan. 20.\n\nBut the foundation's inner workings have been the subject of Schneiderman's investigation for months and could remain a thorny issue for Trump's incoming administration. Democrats nationally have said they are ready to raise any legal or ethical issues from Trump's global business empire during his presidency.\n\nTrump's charity has admitted that it violated IRS regulations barring it from using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation.\n\nThe admissions by the Donald J. Trump Foundation were in a 2015 tax filing made public after a presidential election in which it was revealed that Trump has used the charity to settle lawsuits, make a $25,000 political contribution and purchase items, such as a painting of himself, that was displayed at one of his properties.\n\nThe 2015 tax filing was posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar on Nov. 18 by someone using an email address from the foundation's law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said GuideStar spokeswoman Jackie Enterline Fekeci.\n\nIn the tax filing, the foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of the regulations not only during 2015, but in prior years. But the tax filing doesn't provide details on the violations.\n\nSchneiderman, a Democrat, launched his investigation into the charity after reporting by The Washington Post drew attention to some of the foundation's purchases.\n\nTrump asserted on Twitter late Monday that his foundation was run efficiently.\n\n\"The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses,\" the president-elect tweeted. \"100% of the money goes to wonderful charities.\"\n\nIt was the latest of several tweets from Trump, who is spending the holiday week at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nEarlier Monday, Trump questioned the effectiveness of the United Nations, saying it's just a club for people to \"have a good time,\" after the U.N. Security Council voted last week to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem,\n\nAnd on Friday, Trump warned, \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th,\" referring to the day he takes office.\n\nThe decision by the Obama administration to abstain from Friday's U.N. vote brushed aside Trump's demands that the U.S. exercise its veto and provided a climax to years of icy relations with Israel's leadership.\n\nThat was only one subject Trump tackled on Twitter on Monday. In an evening post, he wrote that he believes his election as president has boosted the economy.\n\n\"The world was gloomy before I won -- there was no hope,\" he tweeted. \"Now, the market is up nearly 10 percent and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars.\"\n\nMarkets are up since Trump won the general election, although not by that much. The Standard & Poor's 500 is up about 6 percent since Election Day, while the Dow has risen more than 8 percent.\n\nAs for holiday spending, auditing and accounting firm Deloitte projected in September that total 2016 holiday sales were expected to exceed $1 trillion, representing a 3.6 percent to 4.0 percent increase in holiday sales from November through January.

Elijah Cumming, of Maryland, and Frank Pallone, of New Jersey, the top Democrats, respectively, on the House's Oversight and Energy committees.\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby later characterized the requests to his department as \"normal\" questions about how an agency \"is staffed, it is manned and it is resourced.\"\n\n\"Nothing that I've seen and nothing that we're aware of falls outside the lines of what would be a normal,\" he said.\n\nReuters, meanwhile, reported that the team also has asked the State and Homeland Security department for the names of officials working on efforts to counter \"violent extremism.\"\n\nReuters reported that some career officials were concerned about what the incoming administration would do regarding those programs.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to fight radical Islamic terrorism and frequently criticized Obama for avoiding the term \"radical Islam\" to describe the Islamic State and other such terror groups.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.17258882522583, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 657, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.21287855128, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.13089802130898, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/09/south-korean-lawmakers-voted-to-impeach-president-park-geun-hye.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [83]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 790, "scraper_regex": 1125}}, "headline": "South Korean lawmakers vote to impeach President Park Geun-hye", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1125, "date": "20161209090000", "story_content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2013 \u00a0South Korean lawmakers on Friday impeached President Park Geun-hye, a stunning and swift fall for the country's first female leader amid protests that drew millions into the streets in united fury.\n\nAfter the vote, parliamentary officials hand-delivered formal documents to the presidential Blue House that stripped Park of her power and allowed the country's No. 2 official, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, to assume leadership until the Constitutional Court rules on whether Park must permanently step down. The court has up to six months to decide.\n\n\"I'd like to say that I'm deeply sorry to the people because the nation has to experience this turmoil because of my negligence and lack of virtue at a time when our security and economy both face difficulties,\" Park said after the vote, before a closed-door meeting with her Cabinet where she and other aides reportedly broke down in tears.\n\nHwang separately said that he wanted \"the ruling and opposition political parties and the parliament to gather strength and wisdom so that we can return stability to the country and people as soon as possible.\"\n\nOnce called the \"Queen of Elections\" for her ability to pull off wins for her party, Park has been surrounded in the Blue House in recent weeks by millions of South Koreans who have taken to the streets in protest. They are furious over what prosecutors say was collusion by Park with a longtime friend to extort money from companies and to give that confidante extraordinary sway over government decisions.\n\nOrganizers said about 10,000 people gathered in front of the National Assembly to demand that lawmakers pass the impeachment motion. Some had spent the night on the streets after traveling from other cities. Scuffles broke out between angry anti-Park farmers, some of whom had driven tractors to the assembly from their farms, and police. When impeachment happened, many of those gathered raised their hands in the air and leapt about, cheering and laughing.\n\n\"Can you hear the roar of the people in front of the National Assembly?\" Kim Kwan-young, an opposition lawmaker said ahead of the vote, referring to South Korea's formal name. \"Our great people have already opened the way. Let's make it so we can stand honorably in front of history and our descendants.\"\n\nThe handover of power prompted the prime minister to order South Korea's defense minister to put the military on a state of heightened readiness to brace for any potential provocation by North Korea. No suspicious movements by the North were reported, however.\n\nPark will be formally removed from office if at least six of the Constitutional Court's nine justices support her impeachment, and the country would then hold a presidential election within 60 days.\n\nNational Assembly speaker Chung Sye-kyun said the bill on Park's impeachment was passed by a vote of 234 for and 56 opposed, with seven invalid votes and two abstentions. That well surpassed the necessary two-thirds vote needed in the 300-seat assembly, with the opposition getting strong support from members of Park's party.\n\nPresent for the vote were relatives of the victims of a 2014 ferry disaster that killed more than 300 and was blamed in part on government incompetence and corruption; they cheered and clapped after the impeachment was announced. Most lawmakers left the hall quietly, though some could be seen taking selfies as they waited to vote.\n\nLawmakers from both parties faced huge pressure to act against Park, the daughter of a military dictator still revered by many conservatives for lifting the country from poverty in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nHer approval ratings had plunged to 4 percent, the lowest among South Korean leaders since democracy came in the late 1980s, and even elderly conservatives who once made up her political base have distanced themselves from her. An opinion survey released earlier Friday showed 81 percent of respondents supported Park's impeachment.\n\nSouth Korean lawmakers last voted to impeach a president in 2004, when they accused late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun of minor election law violations and incompetence. The Constitutional Court restored Roh's powers about two months later, ruling that his wrongdoings weren't serious enough to justify his unseating.\n\nThe chances of the court reinstating Park are considered low because her charges are much graver. Some legal experts say the court might need more than a couple of months to decide. This is because Park's case is much more complicated than Roh's, and because her lawyers will likely press the court not to uphold the impeachment unless the suspicions against her are proven.\n\nHundreds gathered Friday night at a boulevard in front of an old palace gate in downtown Seoul, which has been the center of demonstrations in recent weeks calling for Park's removal. Protesters planned to march close to the Blue House.\n\nThe impeachment is a remarkable fall for Park, who convincingly beat her liberal opponent in 2012. Park's single, five-year term was originally set to end Feb. 24, 2018.\n\nThe political turmoil around Park comes after years of frustration over a leadership style that inspired comparisons to her father, Park Chung-hee. Critics saw in Park an unwillingness to tolerate dissent as her government cracked down on press freedom, pushed to dissolve a leftist party and allowed aggressive police suppression of anti-government protests, which saw the death of an activist in 2016.\n\nShe also was heavily criticized over her government's handling of the 2014 ferry sinking; most of those victims were school kids.\n\nPark has repeatedly apologized over the public anger caused by the latest scandal, but has denied any legal wrongdoing. She attempted to avoid impeachment last month by making a conditional offer to step down if parliament could come up with a stable power-transfer plan, but the overture was dismissed by opposition lawmakers as a stalling ploy.\n\nIn indicting Park's longtime friend, Choi Soon-sil, and two former presidential aides last month, state prosecutors said they believed the president was \"collusively involved\" in criminal activities by the suspects. Choi and the two former aides were accused of bullying large companies into providing tens of millions of dollars and favors to foundations and businesses Choi controlled, and enabling Choi to interfere with state affairs.\n\nPark's lawyer has called the accusations groundless.\n\nPark first met Choi in the 1970s, around the time Park was acting as first lady after her mother was killed during a 1974 assassination attempt on her father. Choi's father, a shadowy figure named Choi Tae-min who was a Buddhist monk, a religious cult leader and a Christian pastor at different times, emerged as Park's mentor.\n\nThe Choi clan has long been suspected of building a fortune by using their connections with Park to extort companies and government organizations. Choi's ex-husband is also a former close aide of Park's.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.35451507568359, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 790, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.6792920626999996, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161209090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.91139240506329, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/15/trumps-choices-cabinet-renew-debate-over-opening-alaskas-arctic-refuge-to-oil-drilling.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [426, 520]}}, "headline": "Trump's choices of Cabinet renew debate over opening Alaska's Arctic refuge to oil drilling", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1154, "date": "20161215150000", "story_content": "Oil companies who have long coveted an environmentally sensitive Alaskan refuge may be on the verge of tapping its huge reserves under a Donald Trump administration that has signaled its support for fossil fuels.\n\n\nTrump's nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency and Exxon Mobil\u00a0CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state -- along with rumors that he will choose Montana Rep.\u00a0Ryan Zinke as Interior Secretary -- have buoyed the hopes of many energy industry insiders and Alaskan lawmakers who have seen attempts to drill the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge thwarted during President Obama's time in office.\n\n\"This is exactly the time we need to start developing the area,\" Nick Loris, an energy expert at the Washington D.C.-based conservative think tank, the Heritage Foundation, told FoxNews.com. \"It will take more of a hurdle given what Obama has done, but it can be undone.\"\n\nAt the heart of the battle over ANWR \u2013 a 19 million-acre tract of land flanked by the Brooks Range to the south, the Beaufort Sea to the north and Canada's Yukon province to the east \u2013 is a section of the refuge called the coastal plain, or section 1002.\n\nOn one side of the debate: Alaska's Republican lawmakers and a fossil fuel industry that sees the estimated 7.7 billion barrels of oil under the coastal plain a boon to the state's flagging economy that has suffered from low oil prices on the global market and a decline in crude flowing through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n\nOn the other side: Environmental groups and the indigenous Gwich'in people, who consider the coastal plain sacred land and say oil drilling would ruin a fragile habitat for gray wolves, polar bears, porcupine caribou and more than 200 species of migratory birds.\n\n\"ANWR is a national treasure and an amazing piece of land,\" Nicole Whittington-Evans, the Wilderness Society's Alaska regional director, told FoxNews.com. \"It is not a place where oil and gas development should be allowed.\"\n\nThe refuge was created in 1980 as part of comprehensive public-lands legislation signed into law by President Jimmy Carter that put more than 100 million federal acres in Alaska under conservation protection. Lawmakers at the time recognized the potential for oil drilling on the coastal plain but they prohibited leasing or other development on the land unless authorized by a future Congress.\n\nThat is basically where the issue has stood for the past 36 years as Alaskan lawmakers' and oil industry executives' advances have been thwarted in Congress.\n\nIn 1995, the Alaskan delegation inserted a provision opening ANWR to development in a budget reconciliation bill, but the bill was vetoed by President Bill Clinton. In 2005, despite having the Senate, House and White House all in Republican hands, a push to open ANWR was also unsuccessful as a number of moderate Republicans voted against it.\n\nRecently \u2013 as global oil prices have dropped to just more than $50 per barrel \u2013 oil companies have backed away from pushing to open ANWR and instead focused on their existing projects. Royal Dutch Shell in 2015 indefinitely canceled plans to drill in the Arctic and an oil industry consortium that included Exxon Mobil and BP recently suspended its arctic exploration program in the Beaufort Sea.\n\nIn the same year, the Obama administration made an official recommendation to Congress to designate 12.3 million acres of ANWR \u2013 including the coastal plain \u2013 as wilderness, the highest level of protection available to public lands and a move, that if approved by Congress, would be the largest ever wilderness designation since Congress passed the Wilderness Act in 1964.\n\nParts of ANWR are already designated as wilderness, but not the coastal plain and Obama's recommendation would prevent any road or industrial development on the land.\n\n\"Designating vast areas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as Wilderness reflects the significance this landscape holds for America and its wildlife,\" outgoing Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a statement. \"Just like Yosemite or the Grand Canyon, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of our nation's crown jewels and we have an obligation to preserve this spectacular place for generations to come.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress has so far ignored the president's recommendation and the future of the refuge looks to be decided under the Trump administration \u2013 an idea that is very appealing to those in the Alaska congressional delegation.\n\n\"We have been working to advance ANWR for decades now. And we need to have the support of the Congress,\" Murkowski told the Alaska Dispatch News on election night. \"But if the numbers continue for us with the Senate and you have a president who has expressed support, I will be chairing the energy committee again, and I am going to look to push that early on.\"\n\nA Trump administration and a Republican-held Congress, however, doesn't mean that oil drilling in ANWR is a guarantee. GOP senators need 60 votes to get closure on any legislation allowing drilling in ANWR and to prevent a Democratic filibuster, but there are only 52 Republicans in the Senate.\n\n\"To open up ANWR you need to get 60 votes, so the question is 'can you get eight Democrats to vote for it?'\" Robert McNally, the president of the Rapidan Group, an energy consulting firm, and former official in the George W. Bush administration, told FoxNews.com.\n\nMcNally added: \"There may be a push to do it, but it might be better to wait for 2018 and see if they can get a filibuster-proof Congress.\"\n\nThe other option for Alaskan lawmakers \u2013 and a scenario that increasingly concerns environmental groups \u2013 is repeating their move in 1995 and attaching an ANWR provision to a budget reconciliation bill. This only requires 51 votes, cannot be filibustered and, unlike in 1995, won't face the threat of a veto by a Democratic president.\n\n\"Republicans may try to put drilling in the Arctic into the budget reconciliation bill,\" Athan Manuel, the director of the land protection program at the Sierra Club, told FoxNews.com. \"So we have our work cut out for us to win over some Republicans.\"\n\nIn his remaining time in office, Obama does have one card up his sleeve that could permanently halt any efforts to open ANWR to oil drilling \u2013 declare the region a national monument.\n\nThe 1906 Antiquities Act allows presidents to designate monuments as a way to protect natural, cultural or scientific features on certain pieces of land. Since its enactment, 15 presidents have designated more than 150 monuments with Obama using the law 25 times \u2013 most recently to expand the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine Monument in Hawaii.\n\nThere has been little indication, however, that Obama plans to declare ANWR a monument in his final weeks in office and environmental groups say they are gearing up for a clash with the incoming administration.\n\n\"We've pushed the Obama administration to name the coastal area a national monument, but that probably won't happen,\" Manuel said. \"So we're bracing for a fight.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.16279065608978, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1130, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.28720949911, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.65486725663717, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/02/new-mexico-road-rage-killer-learns-his-sentence.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 587, "scraper_regex": 627}}, "headline": "New Mexico road-rage killer learns his sentence", "wordcount_as_scraped": 627, "date": "20161202170000", "story_content": "The suspect charged in a shooting that killed a 4-year-old Albuquerque girl during what police say was a road-rage fight was sentenced to 16 years in prison on a murder charge Thursday before a packed courtroom filled with the tearful family members of the young victim.\n\nTony Torrez, 33, apologized to the girl's family at his plea hearing a day after he accepted a deal with prosecutors that called for them to dismiss two counts of assault and a first-degree murder charge in exchange for him entering an Alford plea to a second-degree murder charge.\n\nMAN ACCUSED OF KILLING EX-NFL PLAYER JOE MCKNIGHT RELEASED FROM CUSTODY\n\nFirst-degree murder carried a life term.

Lilly was struck with a bullet in the back of the head and died at University of New Mexico Hospital.\n\nA prosecutor said experts would have testified at the jury trial that Lilly immediately became unconscious when she was shot and that she wasn't able to feel any pain.\n\nTorrez told investigators that Garcia had run him off the road and that he feared for his life when he shot at the family's truck with the intention of firing off warning shots. He also said he did not know children were in the backseat when he opened fire -- a defense that Veronica Garcia, the victim's mother, rejected outright in her comments to the judge.\n\nThrough tears, Veronica Garcia recalled in court how she rushed to the hospital the day of the killing, and described the toll the shooting has taken on her family.\n\nShe and her husband brought photographs of their daughter to court, with one large image of the victim smiling and wearing a pink tank top and matching cowboy boots propped against a courtroom bench.\n\n\"Lilly was a beautiful, comedic young girl that had a spark to her that I know if she had the chance she would have been somebody,\" Veronica Garcia said.\n\nShe also described her anger at what she sees as faults in the state's justice, saying she remained outraged that Torrez had not been held accountable in court in the past.\n\nTorrez has an arrest record, but no prior felony convictions, according to online court records. He had a previous arrest on domestic violence and aggravated battery charges but evaded prosecution in the case and others, including an altercation that police said followed a dispute over a lane change in a parking structure.\n\nIn the months following her daughter's death, she became a vocal advocate for tougher crime laws and agreed to have a proposed law that would have expanded the state's three-strikes statute named for her daughter.\n\nThe legislation died in the Legislature this year. It would have added more than a dozen felonies to the list of crimes that make offenders with multiple violent crime convictions eligible for life sentences.\n\nTorrez's attorneys had signaled in court motions and hearings that they would argue during the trial that Alan Garcia, the victim's father, also was to blame in the road rage fight.\n\n\"I'm not perfect, I have my flaws,\" Garcia said. \"But I have no criminal record, especially one as colorful as that of Mr. Torrez.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -10.9399070739746, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 587, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.49627822141, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0664395229982997, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/10/warehouse-fire-survivor-people-dying-right-in-front-me.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [3004], "\u00a0": [78]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 914, "scraper_regex": 972}}, "headline": "Warehouse fire survivor: People 'dying right in front of me'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 972, "date": "20161210070000", "story_content": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2013 \u00a0To set foot in the Ghost Ship on a party night was to pass through the doors of an old warehouse and enter an exotic world glowing with rainbow lanterns, guarded by figures of Asian deities and pulsing with a welcoming vibe.\n\nPerformers who came to play the electronic dance party last weekend and those looking to be awed by the sounds and scene wanted to be among people who accepted them for who they were.

It's why we call it the underground.\"\n\nBut comfort among kindred spirits masked dangers that seem hard to have missed after fire raced through the building, killing 36 people in the deadliest U.S. structure fire since 2003.\n\nIt was a death trap with no fire alarms and no sprinklers. Two sets of stairs from the second-floor party did not lead to the only two exits.\n\nFor those who survived, it was largely a matter of luck that when the first cries of \"fire\" were heard, they were able to find their way through the smoke or were near enough to a door or already outside.\n\n\"To think when I was squeezing out of that gate there were people suffocating inside is such a horrific thought,\" said Alastair Boone, who had been socializing in a side yard and escaped to the street through a fence. \"People were dying right in front of me and I didn't know.\"\n\nThe Ghost Ship was one of many Oakland warehouses converted to work and living havens for musicians and artists. The communal living spaces have helped nurture a thriving underground art scene and provide space at a reasonable price in an area where astronomical rent hikes fueled by the tech boom have driven many people out.\n\nThe warehouse was home to the Satya Yuga Collective founded by Derick Ion Almena, who billed it on Facebook as a \"helter skelter\" bomb shelter and \"Indonesian straw huts rolling into valleys and down alleys.\"\n\nIt was in the industrial Fruitvale section of the city that is home to a large Latino population and features a bustling retail corridor of taco shops, check cashing businesses and a dress shop.\n\nAlmena and his partner, Micah Allison, leased the warehouse and rented out work and living space. Almena also rented it for occasional all-night parties. The couple and their three kids were not home the night of the fire.\n\nThe building owned by Chor N. Ng, however, was only permitted to be a warehouse and the city was investigating complaints about trash and people living inside.\n\nA criminal investigation of the fire could lead to charges as serious as murder, prosecutors said.\n\nThe interior was constantly changing as tenants moved out and others took their place and redesigned more than a dozen living spaces.\n\nUpstairs, a large public area was elaborately decorated in a Bohemian m\u00e9lange of eastern religious artifacts, tapestries, old furniture and colorful prayer rugs. Organs, pianos and guitars were scattered throughout. Visitors described it as a beautiful work of art itself.\n\nBut hazards were many. It was a cluttered labyrinth built with scrap wood. Electrical cords snaked between appliances, musical equipment and lights. A set of stairs was assembled with stacked pallets and a wobbly ramp.\n\nBhatt was wary of all kinds of dangers. He wouldn't promote a show there because he didn't want that responsibility, but he was willing to compromise and take the risk of performing and attending events there.\n\nSeveral of Bhatt's friends were performing Dec. 2, playing a variety of electronic dance music that ranged from DJs mixing sounds to musicians playing synthesizers and drum machines.\n\nHe arrived before the fire broke out, but never entered because he was talking with friends out front. One of them, Joey Matlock, a DJ known as Joey Casio, had gone inside.\n\nBhatt heard someone yell, \"fire,\" and people began streaming out the door, followed by black smoke. Matlock was not one of them.\n\nInvestigators haven't identified the cause of the fire, but they said it started in the rear of the building. They ruled out a refrigerator as the cause, but were still looking at electrical systems as possible sources.\n\nResidents on the first floor described waking up to the smell of smoke and barely having time to get dressed before being chased out by a wall of flame. Some at the party upstairs were able to bypass the rickety makeshift stairs and jump from the loft in their haste to get out.\n\nChristopher Farstad, a musician visiting from Minneapolis, inhaled a lungful of smoke when he stepped from a bathroom a moment before the lights went out.\n\nAfter finding his way to safety through the dark, he tried to go back to help others. But the light on his phone wasn't bright enough and the smoke was overpowering. He had walked in on his feet, but came out on his hands and knees.\n\nHe and others called for those lost inside: \"Come this way! The exit's over here!\" they repeated.\n\nOnly a few came out.\n\nPeople were weeping and embracing each other as firefighters tried to tame the flames.

Children's parties have hammered at Trump-shaped pi\u00f1atas, donkeys have been dressed up as the property magnate during town festivals and protest marches across the country followed Trump's surprise election victory.\n\n\"When I first introduce myself to Mexicans, I almost immediately tell them I voted for Hillary,\" said Larry Pihl, a regional chairman of Democrats Abroad in Guadalajara. \"As American expats we want to distance ourselves as much as possible from Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"Americans have always been very difficult neighbors [to Mexico], and those of us who live here are emissaries of our culture,\" he told Fox News. \"Trump based an entire campaign on insulting a place we now call home, and it's vital to make it clear that we share Mexico's outrage.\"\n\nLarry's organization Democrats Abroad, an official overseas wing of the party, held voter registration drives throughout Mexico prior to November in an attempt to galvanize the overseas vote, and says that the overriding sensation following election night was one of \"shellshock.\"\n\n\"Many Mexicans see all Americans as representative of Trump's ideology, no matter how we voted,\" he said. \"I have many good friendships here, but you can't keep apologizing for something you didn't do.\"\n\nYet for Trump voters living in Mexico, the reality of having cast their ballot for the property magnate is far worse than frosty looks and cold shoulders.\n\n\"I'm getting the hell out of Mexico as soon as my lease is up in January,\" said Jefferson O'Kysen, a Trump voter who currently considers himself the most unpopular man in San Miguel de Allende. \"I was dancing in the streets after on election night, but I had to put a stop to that to avoid bad confrontations.\"\n\nOriginally from California, O'Kysen moved abroad seven years ago and says San Miguel de Allende, where the town council declared Trump persona non grata in September, is no longer a place where he feels safe talking openly about his political views.\n\n\"They think Trump's the devil down here, and I've learned the hard way to keep my mouth shut and try to avoid the topic,\" he told Fox News. \"I could handle a few dirty looks, but it makes people very angry and I've been in some very nasty situations.\"\n\n\"I've gotta get out of this town,\" he said.\n\nA popular spot for the younger American expat crowd, Dan Defossey's Pinche Gringo BBQ in Mexico City held sold-out events for the presidential debates and election night, the last of which turned sour when the pro-Hillary crowd began to realize the implications of a Trump presidency for Mexico.\n\n\"We had people crying throughout the joint when they realized what was happening,\" said Dan, who watched the country's peso lose 10 per cent of its value overnight. \"It was a very nervous few days following the result.\"\n\nThe founder of Pinche Gringo - a common phrase used to express frustration with Freakin' Gringos - Dan's close friends advised him to change the name of his business for fear of vandalism and retributions.\n\n\"I refused to do it,\" he told Fox News. \"Mexicans think Americans are cultureless loudmouths, and the name comes with a spirit of humility that aims to bring people together.\"\n\nHis decision appears to have paid off. Pinche Gringo BBQ held a Thanksgiving celebration at the end of last month, which was attracted over 1,000 diners, most of whom were Mexicans eager to experience the American holiday tradition for the first time.\n\n\"Mexicans don't tend to judge people based on their political beliefs like we do up north,\" he said. \"In the U.S. you're either Democrat or Republican, but in Mexico that's not so important.\"\n\nAs for the manager of the American Benevolent Society, Barbara Franco expects expat Americans' fears in Mexico to subside with time.\n\n\"The truth is that as expats, we are as disconnected from the current political climate in America as the Mexicans we live alongside,\" she told Fox News. \"None of us could understand the result, but we don't live the lives of average Americans down here.\"\n\n\"I see Donald Trump in the White House the same way I saw moving to Mexico in the first place\", she said. \"We will have to learn to live with it.\"\n\n\n\nAlasdair Baverstock is a freelance writer based in Mexico.\n\n\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.2132797241210898, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 850, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.2398346997299998, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216200000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.4117647058823501, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/14/first-100-days-trump-vows-big-changes-for-trade-with-china.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1991, 2466, 4086]}}, "headline": "The First 100 Days: Trump vows big changes for trade with China", "wordcount_as_scraped": 759, "date": "20161214200000", "story_content": "Peter Gigante was an early Donald Trump supporter, based on a single issue: Trade with China.\n\n\"He's right on,\" he told Fox News. \"The time for Trump is now. It's either now or never.\"\n\nGigante has a deep perspective on the U.S.-China trade relationship. He lived in the port city of Qingdao for eight years, developed a business park and imported foreign goods. He met his wife Joanna in the city and raised a daughter.\n\n\"We're giving things away. It's the greatest theft in the history of mankind. I've felt that way for a long time, and nobody's done anything about it,\" he said.\n\nIn 2010, he moved to Bellingham, Wash., where he began exporting many products, including Alaskan fish and timber, back to China. He says the playing field has never been level. China puts tariffs up to 30 percent on U.S. fish, while Chinese fish comes here duty-free.\n\n\"By pegging their currency to our dollar and manipulating their currency, they basically are grabbing us by the nose and kicking us in the rump,\" he said.\n\nGigante has high hopes for the next administration. Since becoming president-elect, Trump hasn't changed his tough tune on China.\n\n\"They haven't played by the rules, and I know they're going to start, they're going to start,\" Trump said last week during a speech in Iowa. \"They've got to.\"\n\nDuring a bruising campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump said he would label China a currency manipulator, scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and hit Chinese imports with tariffs up to 45 percent. All are needed, Trump has contended, to level the $356 billion trade imbalance with the Asian superpower.\n\n\"The nation of China is responsible for almost half of America's trade deficit,\" Trump said.\n\nBut the tough talk has some in the U.S. worried about a full-blown trade war. According to the Pacific Maritime Association in San Francisco, 40 percent of all cargo at our ports is coming to and from China.\u00a0\n\nAndy Wilson, vice chairman of the Washington State China Relations Council, has helped that relationship grow.\n\n\"The strength of what's happened over the past decades is we have interdependent economies, we trade both ways. The downside is there is pain that can be inflicted both ways,\" he said.\n\nWashington state, with its agriculture and aerospace industries, is more dependent on trade with China than any state in the union. Twenty-six billion dollars' worth of goods\u00a0 passed through the Port of Seattle this year, fueled by Boeing, which now sells a quarter of all its commercial planes to China, a market expected to grow by a trillion dollars over the next 20 years.\n\nThe American plane builder seemed well-positioned after hosting China's Xi Jinping last year in Seattle. But analysts expect Boeing to be the first victim of Chinese retaliation if trade tensions escalate.\n\n\"The Chinese government has a long history of using aircraft orders as reward or punishment,\" said Scott Hamilton, a commercial aviation expert at Leeham.net.\n\nApple and cherry growers in the Evergreen State also are potential losers in a Trump trade war. A slowdown of car sales to China could hurt states like Michigan and Wisconsin, which have Ford Motor Co. factories.\n\nStephanie Bowman, a commissioner at the Port of Seattle, said both sides will lose with increased taxes and tariffs.\n\n\"It would be absolutely devastating for businesses and workers if we were to continue on a trade war route,\" she said.\n\nBut Dan DiMicco, Trump's transition team leader on trade who once led the U.S. steel company Nucor, said there already is a trade war.\n\nIn a blog post, he wrote Trump will end the attacks by \"negotiating from a position of strength, not condescending weakness. In the end, it will be in China's best interest to stop cheating on trade.\"\n\nTrump nominated Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as his ambassador to China last week. Branstad has a 30-year relationship with Chinese President Xi and, if confirmed by the Senate, could provide steady diplomacy to Trump's blustery demands for a level playing field.\u00a0\n\n\"We're going to have mutual respect ... and China's going to benefit and we're going to benefit,\" Trump said last week when introducing Branstad.\n\nBack in Bellingham, Gigante is excited about Trump's first 100 days that could reshape the world's biggest economies.\n\n\"He's a pretty tough negotiator, I mean, he starts pushing his opponent to the far end of the field and then starts working his way back. Where he settles, nobody knows.\"\n\n\n\nDan Springer joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in August 2001 as a Seattle-based correspondent.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.27531290054321, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 733, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.46630181205, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8649386084583903, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/17/porn-studio-owner-to-be-tried-on-charges-running-brothel.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [69]}}, "headline": "Porn studio owner to be tried on charges of running brothel", "wordcount_as_scraped": 546, "date": "20170117200000", "story_content": "PHOENIX \u2013 \u00a0The owner of a business in an industrial area of Phoenix says he was running a legitimate porn studio where amateurs could rent cameras, lights and props to create their own sex scenes with the help of a model.\n\nAuthorities, however, say it was nothing more than a cleverly disguised brothel raking in $40,000 a month in profits.\n\nOwner William James Hartwell denies running a prostitution ring and in court documents accuses the government of criminalizing free speech protected by the First Amendment.\n\nHe will go on trial next week on charges of operating a house of prostitution, sex trafficking and sexual assault in the intriguing legal clash over the First Amendment.\n\nHartwell, 56, says the sex acts that were recorded and photographed amount to constitutionally protected free speech practiced in the same way as professional porn studios that legally operate.\n\n\"All sexual conduct that took place at the studio was for the purpose of exploring and expressing an individual's sexuality via safe and legal adult content creation,\" Hartwell wrote in court records.\n\nA call left for Rick Poster, an attorney for Hartwell, wasn't returned.\n\nPolice say female employees who took customers into rooms would insist on shooting a minutes-long video or taking 10 photos with sexual content before the cameras were discarded and they began to have sex.\n\nProsecutors say those images were taken in a bid to guard against any future prostitution allegations.\n\nTo get into the location, men had to respond to an online ad and were given the address only after they called from a nearby gas station. Once inside, documents say, they had to show their genitals as a way to guard against undercover officers. (Police have to avoid the appearance of being participants in sex so they can maintain credibility when cases go to court.)\n\nThe investigation was launched in 2012 after police received a tip about the business.\n\nAuthorities sent informants who posed as customers or prospective employees. One informant said Hartwell told her during a job interview that the studio provides customers with porn production space, cameras, condoms and a \"free porn girl,\" court documents state.\n\nA website for the business said customers couldn't give their money to anyone other than a receptionist \u2014 and could only do so for equipment rental and studio fees. Authorities say the sex workers were told they didn't have to worry about the legal ramifications of prostitution because they didn't handle any money.\n\nInvestigators say customers were allowed to pick up a USB drive with still photos or videos a few days after a sexual encounter. About half the customers actually returned to pick up the images.\n\nSeveral women who worked at the studio have pleaded guilty to related charges and are expected to testify at the trial.\n\n\"Prosecuting the defendant and workers for crimes related to prostitution is lawful,\" prosecutor Monica Sochacki said in court records.\n\nHartwell is also charged with sexually assaulting two women at the business who said they didn't want to participate anymore.\n\nIt's unclear whether any of the customers were charged with crimes.\n\nThe Maricopa County Attorney's Office, which is prosecuting Hartwell, declined to comment on the case beyond what is in the court records.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jacques Billeaud at twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud.

She was reportedly emaciated at just 87 pounds, and suffering from cuts, bruises, even a \"branding.\" On top of that, the abductors had cut off her long blonde hair.\n\nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA KIDNAP CASE FULL OF MYSTERY\n\nHow does a victim and her family begin to heal after such a horrific event? Although Papini's family didn't directly experience the ordeal, her kidnapping affects them, too.\n\n\"It is important to realize that families and friends of hostages are confronted with numerous issues in coping with fears and uncertainties as well and may also need support in dealing with their own emotional reactions,\" notes the American Psychological Association (APA) on its website, about the aftermath of an abduction. \"Family and friends can support survivors by listening, being patient and focusing on their freedom instead of engaging in negative talk about the captors.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA MOM FOUND ALONG HIGHWAY HAD MESSAGE BURNED ONTO SKIN, SHERIFF SAYS\n\nThe Papini family seems to be doing just that. Papini's sister, Sheila Koester, issued the following statement on behalf of Papini and her husband at a news conference, focusing on the blessing of her sister's return: \"We are overwhelmed with joy of how supportive everyone has been to help bring us together as a family again ... Everyone's tireless efforts have made our family whole again this Thanksgiving. Thank you for allowing our family time to heal and for giving us our privacy.\"\n\nKidnapping is an extremely traumatic event that stays with the victim for a lifetime.\n\n\"Years ago, back when hazing at college was more prevalent, I was 'kidnapped' by five guys from my dorm -- they were brothers in a fraternity I was pledging,\" a 52-year-old Hollis, New Hampshire, man told LifeZette. \"I was stuffed into the trunk of a car and then driven miles from our college town and dropped off,\" he continued. \"To this day, I feel like I have echoes of PTSD from that 'prank' - I get very uncomfortable watching shows about kidnapping, for example. Even though it was 'all in fun,' it was one of the most horrifying feelings -- to be trapped in a car trunk, and hear them laughing.\"\n\nEven though they're dealing with their own personal, unique reactions to their loved one's abduction, the Papini family also has the important role of support system to their loved one.\n\n\"Hostage survivors may feel lost or have difficulty managing intense reactions and may need help adjusting to their old life following release,\" advises the APA. \"If there are chronic indications of stress, continued feelings of numbness, disturbed sleep, as well as other signs, the hostage survivor might want to consider seeking help from a licensed mental health professional, such as a psychologist, who can help develop an appropriate strategy for moving forward.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the ABC news program \"20/20,\" husband Keith Papini talked about the personal toll his wife's capture took on him. \"I thought about her being there screaming my name,\" he said.\n\nReceive medical attention.Be in a safe and secure environment.Connect with loved ones.Have an opportunity to talk or journal the experience.Receive resources for counseling.Protect privacy (e.g. avoid media overexposure).Take time to adjust back into family and work.\n\nHe also said his wife's captors pushed her out of a vehicle with a chain around her waist and a bag over her head. \"They left her on the side of a road, badly beaten and bruised, her hair shaved off and her body branded,\" he said. \"She screamed so much, she's coughing up blood from the screaming, trying to get somebody to stop,\" he continued. \"And again, just another sign of how my wife is, she's so wonderful. She's saying, 'Well, maybe people aren't stopping because I have a chain that looks like I broke out of prison' -- so she tried to tuck in her chain under her clothes.\"\n\nWhen he first saw his wife, he was stunned.\n\n\"My first sight was my wife in a hospital bed. Her face [was] covered in bruises ranging from yellow to black because of her repeated beatings,\" he said. \"The bridge of her nose [was] broken. She had been branded and I could feel the rise of her scabs under my fingers.\"\n\nSherri Papini has reportedly been able to share some details about her abductors with authorities -- she related that they were two Hispanic women, armed with a gun. One had long curly hair, thin eyebrows and pierced ears, said Papini -- and the other woman, who was older, had straight black hair with some gray in it, and thick eyebrows. She told investigators both her captors spoke Spanish most of the time.\n\nPapini's children will no doubt be doing their own adjusting to their mom's return -- and her altered appearance. Their exact ages have not yet been revealed; they were in daycare at the time of her abduction.\n\n\"Think of what it is like for young children to be in traumatic situations,\" notes the National Child Trauma Stress Network on its website. \"They can feel totally helpless and passive. They can cry for help or desperately wish for someone to intervene. They can feel deeply threatened by separation from parents or caretakers ...They become really upset when they hear cries of distress from a parent or caretaker.\"\n\nWith appropriate psychological care, supportive family and friends, and time together to adjust, this young family will most likely heal.\n\n\"It is important to keep in mind that human beings are highly resilient and can persevere in spite of tragedy,\" says the AMA. \"Research shows that positive growth and resilience can occur following trauma.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.1030535697937, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 904, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.5617888328300005, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.54424778761062, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/27/pipeline-protesters-vow-to-stay-camped-on-federal-land.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [74]}}, "headline": "Pipeline protesters vow to stay camped on federal land", "wordcount_as_scraped": 790, "date": "20161127160000", "story_content": "CANNON BALL, N.D. \u2013 \u00a0Dakota Access oil pipeline protesters will not follow a government directive to leave the federal land where hundreds have camped for months, organizers said Saturday, despite state officials encouraging them to do so.\n\nStanding Rock Sioux tribal leader Dave Archambault and other protest organizers confidently explained that they'll stay at the Oceti Sakowin camp and continue with nonviolent protests a day after Archambault received a letter from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that said all federal lands north of the Cannonball River will be closed to public access Dec. 5 for \"safety concerns.\"\n\nThe Corps cited the oncoming winter and increasingly contentious clashes between protesters, who believe the pipeline could harm drinking water and Native American cultural sites, and police.\n\nVETERANS TO STAND WITH STANDING ROCK PROTESTERS\n\nStanding Rock tribal members believe the land in which the encampment is on is owned by the Sioux through a more than century-old treaty with the U.S. government.\n\n\"We are wardens of this land. This is our land and they can't remove us,\" said protester Isaac Weston, who is an Oglala Sioux member from South Dakota. \"We have every right to be here to protect our land and to protect our water.\"\n\nThe vast majority of the several hundred people fighting against the four-state, $3.8 billion pipeline have created a self-sustaining community at the sprawling camp, which is on Corps land in southern North Dakota, and have put up semi-permanent structures or brought motor homes and trailers in advance of the harsh winter.\n\nOn the unseasonably warm Saturday, people were chopping wood and setting up tents at the encampment, which is more than a mile from a Missouri River reservoir where the final large segment of the pipeline is yet to be completed due to the Corps consulting with the tribe. Authorities had set up a staging area about a mile away on a hill overlooking the site.\n\nDallas Goldtooth, a protest organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, said it is \"an atrocious example that colonization has not ended for us here as indigenous people,\" and that the government's request will escalate already rocky tensions.\n\nRepresentatives from the Army Corps of Engineers didn't immediately return multiple messages Friday or Saturday seeking comment and verification of the letter. Last month, the Corps said it would not evict the encampment, which started as overflow from smaller private and permitted protest sites nearby and began growing in August.\n\nPresident Barack Obama raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline in that area earlier this month, something Kelcy Warren, CEO of Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners, told The Associated Press is not an option from the company's standpoint. Obama said his administration is monitoring the \"challenging situation\" but would \"let it play out for several more weeks.\"\n\nSome of the protests have resulted in violent confrontations \u2014 one woman suffered a serious arm injury last weekend \u2014 and more than 500 people have been arrested since August.\n\nThe Corps' letter, according to Archambault, said that those who stay on the land after Dec. 5 may be prosecuted, and that there'll be a free speech zone south of the river.\n\nArchambault said Saturday that he doesn't believe the Corps will forcibly evict people from the camp, adding that the tribe is working to provide protesters protection from the elements on its reservation, which is south of the Cannonball River, but offered few details.\n\nIt's the federal government's job to peacefully close the camp because it allowed people to stay there in the first place, Gov. Jack Dalrymple said in a statement Saturday.\n\n\"Our state and local law enforcement agencies continue to do all they can to keep private property and public infrastructure free from unpermitted protest activities, and its past time that the federal government provides the law enforcement resources ... to enforce their own order to vacate,\" the Republican said.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Morton County Commission chairman Cody Schulz, who said county and state leaders have been seeking federal law enforcement help for months. \"It's now time for the federal government to live up to its obligations\" said Schulz.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven and Democratic U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp said the protesters need to move for public safety.\n\n\"The well-being and property of ranchers, farmers and everyone else living in the region should not be threatened by protesters who are willing to commit acts of violence,\" Hoeven said in a statement Friday. He also called on the Obama administration to let work on the pipeline move forward, saying, \"this difficult situation has gone on too long and we need to get it resolved.\"\n\nHeitkamp said the Corps' order is \"a needed step to support the safety of residents, workers, protesters and law enforcement.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.47305393218994, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 760, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.2218263902999995, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161127160000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.94736842105263, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/01/03/supervised-injection-site-for-addicts-could-save-san-francisco-money-lives.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Supervised injection site for addicts could save San Francisco money, lives", "wordcount_as_scraped": 723, "date": "20170103140000", "story_content": "Addicts regularly use drugs on the streets of San Francisco, and some people there say giving addicts a safe, clean place to shoot up - and clean needles - could help curb overdose deaths and diseases.\n\nBut critics object to enabling addicts to shoot illegal drugs in a supervised injection facility in San Francisco - or anywhere in the U.S.\n\nA new cost-benefit analysis in the Journal of Drug Issues makes the financial case for a supervised injection site. A 13-booth facility in San Francisco could save $3.5 million a year, mostly in reduced medical costs, the report calculates.\n\nThe estimate assumes San Francisco would open a center exactly like Insite - North America's first legal supervised drug-injection site built in Vancouver, Canada in 2003. Insite serves an estimated 1,700 people a month.\n\nAn injection facility in San Francisco would save the life of one drug user who would otherwise die of an overdose every four years and would assist in getting 110 drug addicts medication-assisted treatment each year, the new study suggests.\n\nIn addition, it would prevent an average of 19 cases of hepatitis C and three cases of HIV infection a year and would reduce hospital stays for skin and soft-tissue infections related to needle use by 415 days a year.\n\n\"To me, it's really a win-win for everyone,\" senior author Alex Kral said in a phone interview. \"It's a win for the community to get people off the streets, and it's a win for the people injecting drugs to be sure they can be as safe as possible.\"\n\nAn epidemiologist, Kral directs the behavioral and urban health program at RTI International, a nonprofit research institute with headquarters in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.\n\nPropelled by prescription painkiller and heroin abuse, U.S. deaths from drug overdoses hit a record 47,055 in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study authors estimate the U.S. spends more than $6 billion a year covering the medical expenses of people who inject drugs.\n\n\"This is one way to reduce what is one of the biggest sources of mortality in the country,\" Kral said.\n\n\"We've tried a lot of things in the last 50 years, and none of them have succeeded,\" he said. \"So why not try an innovative, evidence-based solution that's working in upwards of a dozen countries?\"\n\nSince the first supervised injection facility opened in the Swiss city of Berne in 1986, nearly 100 similar facilities have opened in 66 cities across 11 countries. U.S. cities from Seattle to New York have considered installing drug-injection sites, but none have been able to clear the hurdles.\n\nKral and his team assumed it would cost $2 million to buy and renovate a site for a supervised injection facility in San Francisco and $2.6 million a year to operate it. For every dollar spent, $2.33 would be saved as a result of averted overdose deaths, reduced disease transmission and increased drug treatment, the researchers found.\n\nThey expect the savings would be greater in other cities where the number of overdose deaths is higher and real estate and operating costs might be lower. San Francisco already slashed heroin overdose deaths from 120 to 13 a year between 2000 and 2012 largely because of widespread distribution of naloxone, a drug that can prevent overdoses by blocking the effects of opioids.\n\nA supervised injection facility would likely bring more financial and life-saving benefits to a city like Baltimore, which has a higher percentage of needle users dying of heroin overdoses, the authors write.\n\nSusan Sherman is working on a similar cost-benefit analysis for an injection facility in Baltimore. A professor of health, behavior and society at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Sherman was not involved with the current study.\n\nPeople fear supervised injection sites, she said, because they believe the facilities could draw drug users to their neighborhoods. But the sites would be located in areas where addicts already live.\n\n\"We have neighborhoods in Baltimore where heroin is the biggest economy,\" she said in a phone interview. \"Having a place to go and not being on a dirty street corner is foundational for dignity and respect, which can transfer into other aspects of their lives.\"\n\n\"Having a safe consumption space somewhere in the U.S. is going to happen,\" Sherman said. \"It's close to reality in New York, Ithaca and Seattle.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.9067357778549191, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 695, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.73332661425, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170103140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5971223021582697, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/07/baby-teethers-may-contain-low-levels-bpa-study-finds.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4979, 7279]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1239, "scraper_regex": 1370}}, "headline": "Baby teethers may contain low levels of BPA, study finds", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1370, "date": "20161207170000", "story_content": "Next time you hand your baby a teething ring to soothe her aching gums, you may be unwittingly exposing her to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and potentially affecting her development, new research published Wednesday in the journal Environmental Science & Technology suggests.\n\nIn a first-of-its-kind study published by the American Chemical Society, researchers analyzed 59 baby teethers commonly sold in the United States, and found 100 percent of them contained Bisphenol A (BPA), Bisphenol S (BPS) or Bisephenol F (BPF), and most contained various parabens, as well as the antimicrobials triclosan and triclocarban.\n\nBPA, a chemical found in plastic packaging, has been linked to obesity, cancer and childhood anxiety and hyperactivity and has been found to mimic estrogen. BPS, a chemical that replaced BPA because experts believed it wouldn't leak into drinks as much as BPA did\u2014 which later was proven wrong\u2014 has been found to cause developmental issues in fish embryos. BPF is another replacement for BPA.\n\n\"These alternatives [to BPA] are equally toxic, or in some cases, more toxic,\" study author Kurunthachalam Kannan, a research scientist at the New York State Department of Health, told FoxNews.com.\n\nParabens are commonly used as a preservative in teethers that are water- or gel-filled to prevent the likely growth of microorganisms. Triclosan and triclocarban are two of the most common ingredients found in antibacterial hand and body wash. In September, the FDA banned some of these antibacterial products because they could cause long-term harm, such as bacterial resistance or hormonal effects.\n\nForty-eight of the studied teethers were labeled BPA-free or non-toxic.\n\nThe teethers, which were manufactured by 23 brands, also leached chemicals when exposed to water, which was used to mimic saliva. Study authors noted a German study previously measured paraben levels found in baby teethers, but the sample only included 10 products and did not analyze chemical leaching.\n\nThe plastics industry claims the amount of BPA used in baby and child care products does not present a health risk, but Kannan said recent studies have suggested that even at a nanogram or microgram level, the chemical can be harmful. Regulation is hazy, Kannan said, because the levels are still being debated and standards are not clearly described.\n\nThe team's findings aren't entirely surprising, said Dr. Josef George Thundiyil, a medical toxicologist and emergency medicine specialist at Orlando Health, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"If you take urine samples, about 90 percent of Americans will have [BPA] in our bodies,\" he told FoxNews.com.\n\nIn 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that BPA could no longer be used in baby bottles and sippy cups. This change was not made for safety but because BPA was no longer deemed necessary as a food additive, according to the FDA.\n\nThere are many substances that could be toxic at the right dose\u2014 including water\u2014 but it's unclear where that number lands for these chemicals, Thundiyil said.\n\n\"What the FDA has concluded is that at current doses, this doesn't appear to be a danger. Where we get the most concerned is when we look at toxicity in those that are most vulnerable\u2014 young kids and unborn fetuses,\" Thundiyil said. \"The question is: Is there a safe dose for a developing child or fetus that might be exposed to this [chemical] that might affect development, hormonal changes, or ongoing developmental issues?\"\n\nOne explanation for the lack of a recommended dosage for children may be that it is difficult to study this particular demographic, Thundiyil noted. Scientists have gained insight from animal studies\u2014 several show toxicity from BPA\u2014 but whether these data apply to humans has yet to be determined.\n\n\"There are studies that show the link between the chemical and different outcomes, but a link isn't always clearly established as being the cause\u2014 that's where the gray area lies,\" he said.\n\nPlus, since BPA was removed from baby bottles and cups, the FDA and other organizations have no longer been able to assess a child's lifetime exposure because that part of the equation was removed, Thundiyil said, adding that the study's finding of EDCs in teething rings may lead researchers to re-account for that exposure.\n\nTo simulate leaching of chemicals in saliva, the team immersed each teether in 200 mL of water for an hour to mimic a child's daily use and measured for 26 potential EDCs.\n\nThey found that parabens were the most commonly leached, with a range of one-tenth to one-hundreth of a nanogram. The max value measured was 2,000 nanograms.\n\nBased on estimates of the body weight of a 12-month-old baby, the team's calculations suggest that levels of BPA and other regulated EDCs in teethers were lower than those of what European regulators consider safe. However, these thresholds are set for individual compounds, \u00a0and regulations don't account for accumulation of multiple EDCs.\n\n\"If we're looking at all different types of chemicals present\u2014 several hundreds of nanograms up to a microgram\u2014 many of these chemicals have been shown to be toxic, even at low levels of exposure,\" Kannan said. \"Putting this cocktail of chemicals, even in low amounts, during critical stages of development of many organs, can have an effect in many stages of life.\"\n\nHe said research suggests multiple, environmentally mediated diseases, including neurodevelopmental issues, diabetes and obesity, that may result from EDC exposure.\n\n\"That's why we're concerned about it\u2014 the early-life exposure and epigenetic changes that results from the EDCs can contribute to some of the disease and development of some of these diseases later in life,\" Kannan said, referring to the study of how genes can change their expression and may influence health outcomes.\n\n\"We should have policies limiting exposure,\" he said.\n\nThundiyil also expressed skepticism.\n\n\"It's always difficult proving what kind effect might occur in combination,\" Thundiyil said. \"[We're] not being exposed to chemicals in a vacuum; we're being exposed to chemicals along with other chemicals. It leaves a big unknown void about the potential interaction and interplay between that substance and another substance that child is being exposed to.\"\n\nBut Thundiyil was most concerned by the fact that most of the products analyzed in the study were labeled as BPA-free or non-toxic.\n\n\"'Non-toxic' can be a very broad designation to state something might have some toxin present, but not at a level that is toxic,\" he said. \"Applied to a single person, that's OK. When you take the same device and apply it over a population, there will be those that use it infrequently, those that use it continuously, those that might use it in ways that are unanticipated, such as using heat to boil, which can enhance the release of [chemicals]. That's what makes it a concern.\"\n\n\"Usually when the FDA makes what we call risk assessments, they usually build those uncertainties in it \u2026 to account for different methods of use, ages, long-term exposure,\" Thundiyil said.\n\nRegardless of whether we realize it, we're all exposed to a small amount of a variety of substances, Thundiyil said. \u00a0\"They're a part of life, what makes things function, what makes a lot of modern conveniences work the way they do.\"\n\nKannan said he did not think EDCs posed an immediate threat to babies, but he suggested parents use frozen waffles as an alternative to plastic teethers, or rinsing the teether with water to possibly help leach possible chemicals.\n\nThundiyil said parents may consider limiting their children's use of teething rings or to use alternatives, but to be mindful of other concrete areas of risk.\n\n\"In some ways it's probably more important to make sure to have your child wear a helmet for bicycling and buckle in their seatbelt,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, those risks are probably higher while others exist, but are still theoretical. It's important not to neglect the things we know cause injury and harm.\"\n\nThe American Chemistry Council, an industry trade association, said the study \"provides very little useful information for the parents of young children, as it focuses on the mere presence of chemicals, which parents should be reassured does not equate with harm.\" In a statement emailed to FoxNews.com, a representative noted that the organization was not aware of any use for BPA or materials made from BPA being used in teethers.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.183813571929931, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1239, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.2856486930700002, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.1299435028248601, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/03/braziles-ethical-breach-why-wont-cnn-disclose-its-internal-investigation.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1255, 1441, 3748, 5692]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 869, "scraper_regex": 945}}, "headline": "Brazile's Ethical Breach: Why won't CNN disclose its internal investigation?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 945, "date": "20161103130000", "story_content": "When CNN dropped Donna Brazile for leaking a town hall question to Hillary Clinton's campaign, the network said nothing publicly.\n\nOnly when a second instance emerged from hacked emails obtained by Wikileaks did CNN announce what it called Brazile's resignation\u2014in a terse statement.\n\nWhen critics urged CNN President Jeff Zucker to launch an internal investigation, he did not respond publicly. But word leaked yesterday that he had told his staff in a televised town hall that there had been such a probe, and it was finished.\n\nNo findings have been released, and Zucker has not addressed the matter publicly.\n\nAll this has added to the swirl of criticism surrounding the woman who is acting chair of the Democratic National Committee and the network where she has been a paid contributor for years. Brazile was vice chair of the DNC when these incidents occurred earlier this year, and temporarily suspended her contract with CNN\u2014and ABC\u2014when she became the party's interim head.\n\nCNN declined to comment publicly, but a network staffer familiar with the situation said the probe found no wrongdoing by anyone at CNN and that no one at CNN had given Brazile advance questions.\u00a0\n\nBrazile, who has denied the leaking despite email evidence to the contrary, has left a stain on CNN's reputation. And Zucker, based on his leaked internal comments, understands this. \u00a0\n\n\"This behavior was completely unacceptable and we are clear, exactly where they came from,\" Zucker said at the meeting, according to sources quoted by Business Insider. He called it a \"very unfortunate situation\" but added that \"one bad apple, I don't think ruins the entire process. Clearly this was unprofessional and this should not have happened and this has been dealt with.\"\n\nBut how has it been dealt with?\n\nWho gave the advance questions to Brazile, based on the \"complete investigation\" Zucker says the network has done?\n\nHas anyone been fired or disciplined?\n\nZucker earlier called Brazile's conduct \"disgusting\" on a conference call, according to the Huffington Post. But again, there has been no public comment. In the Monday statement disclosing that CNN has cut its ties with Brazile, the network said only that it was \"uncomfortable\" with what she had done.\n\nIn the first instance, Brazile wrote Clinton aides before a March town hall with Clinton and Bernie Sanders that sometimes she gets the questions in advance. She shared one about gun control, citing precise statistics that were then used by moderator Roland Martin of TVOne, CNN's partner in the town hall.\n\nZucker told his staff that CNN would \"not partner ever again\" with TVOne, according to Business Insider.\n\nThe strongest comment after that incident came from CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who said in a radio interview that it was \"horrifying\" and \"unethical.\"\n\nIn the second instance revealed this week, Brazile wrote to the Clinton camp in advance of a town hall in Flint, Mich., where the water supply has been tainted: \"One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash. Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.\"\n\nAt the town hall, Lee-Ann Walters, a local resident who has a rash she blames on the water supply, asked that very question:\n\n\"After my family, the city of Flint, and the children in DC were poisoned by lead, will you make a personal promise to me right now, that as president in your first 100 days in office, you will make it a requirement that all public water systems must remove all lead service lines throughout the entire United States, a notification made to the citizens that have said service lines.\"\u00a0\n\nClinton said she would make such a commitment, but Walters told Fox News this week she was not satisfied with the answer\u2014and does not know how her question, refined with a CNN producer in advance, got leaked.\n\nBrazile vehemently denied to me after the first story broke that she had gotten advance questions or given them to the Clinton team, calling the accusation ridiculous. But she could not explain her own email saying that she sometimes got such questions in advance.\n\nThe veteran pundit grew even more heated in a subsequent interview with Fox's Megyn Kelly, invoking her religion and complaining about the illegal hacking of emails belonging to Clinton campaign chief John Podesta.\n\n\"As a Christian woman, I understand persecution, but I will not stand here and be persecuted because your information is totally false\u2026 Podesta's emails were stolen. You're so interested in talking about stolen material, you're like a thief that wants to bring into the night the things that you found,\" she said.\n\nBrazile has been a well-liked and well-respected figure around Washington for a long time. But for CNN to have kept her on the payroll while she was also a top DNC official posed the risk that her true loyalty was to her political party, not the network where she offered commentary.\n\nI have no doubt that Zucker and most CNN journalists are appalled that their process in high-profile campaign events has been tarnished. But they can't resolve the matter without the kind of transparency that news organizations regularly demand from politicians. And that means disclosing the results of the internal investigation and what steps CNN is taking to ensure such an ethical breach doesn't happen again.\n\n\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Last January, a suicide bomber killed 15 people outside a vaccination center in Quetta in an attack claimed by the Pakistani Taliban and another militant group, Jundullah.\n\nMilitants in Pakistan have previously alleged the immunization campaigns are a cover for Western spies.\n\nThe doctor believed to have helped the CIA track down the deceased al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden - architect of the 2001 attacks on the United States - has been accused of using a fake vaccination campaign to collect DNA samples.\n\nBin Laden was killed in a covert raid by U.S. special forces in 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where he was living, straining ties between the U.S. and Pakistan.\n\nPakistan sentenced him in 2012 to 33 years in jail on charges of belonging to militant group Lashkar-e-Islam, which he denies. That sentence was overturned but he remains in jail charged with murder relating to the death of a patient.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.48416328430176, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 829, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 10, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.19089614087, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170103130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.65379975874548, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/12/16/want-to-dump-your-yahoo-email-here-how.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a9": [4262], "\u00a0": [997, 1989, 3061, 3887, 4249]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 690, "scraper_regex": 733}}, "headline": "Want to Dump Your Yahoo Email? Here's How", "wordcount_as_scraped": 733, "date": "20161217020000", "story_content": "The latest data breach to hit Yahoo could prompt users to switch to a different email service. That is, if the company's previous security lapse didn't already send them toward the exits.\n\nYahoo on Wednesday said that a billion user accounts had been hacked in 2013, a crime that wasn't discovered until law enforcement contacted the company this fall. The revelation came just three months after the company disclosed that 500 million accounts had been compromised in 2014. According to the company, both data breaches were linked to state-sponsored actors. The stolen information includes names, phone numbers, birthdates, passwords, and security questions that could be used to reset a password.\n\nIf you're a Yahoo email user who has lost confidence in the service, leaving your email account behind can seem intimidating. The same goes if you're switching from Gmail, Outlook, or any other service.\n\nBut it's fairly simple. Here's how to make the move.\u00a0\n\n\nEmail service providers are more than happy to nab one another's customers, so many offer a feature to import data from one service to another.\n\nIf you're switching to Gmail from another service, click \"Import Mail and Contacts\" under the Accounts and Import tab and enter your account credentials; Google can pull from Yahoo, Outlook, and AOL.\n\nOutlook.com settings include a \"Connected Accounts\" feature, which can pull email from up to 13 separate accounts. You'll have to go to another menu to sync contacts: Select \"People\" in the main Outlook Mail menu, then go to \"Manage\" > \"Import contacts.\"\n\nSwitching to Yahoo takes a little more work. You have to enable an export setting in your old account first. In Gmail settings, for instance, select \"Enable POP for all mail\" in the Forwarding and POP/IMAP Settings tab. Then in Yahoo, go to the Options tab, then Mail Accounts, then Add. Importing contacts is much simpler: Just click on the Contacts tab and click on \"import contacts.\"\u00a0\n\nIf you check email in a browser, that's all you need to do. But if you also make use of your computer's built-in email software, read on.\n\nBoth Windows and Mac OS X have native mail and contacts clients that can sync data with online accounts. If you use those built-in tools, you need to tell them about your new email account.\n\nIn Mail for Windows 10, select \"Manage Accounts\" in Settings, then click \"Add Account.\" If you use Google's two-step authentication feature (and you should), you may have to log in and give Windows permission to access your account.\n\nOnce you're logged in via Mail, the People and Calendar apps will have access to the account, as well.\n\nSimilarly, in Mac OS X, you can add email, contacts, and calendars all at once; in System Preferences select Internet Accounts then click on the \"+\" in the lower-left corner and follow the on-screen prompts.\n\nThis step is optional. But in addition to switching to a new account, you may also want to save an archive to a hard drive. This will give you access to your old emails even if you're offline.\u00a0\n\nIf that's what you're after, consider downloading or signing up for third-party software specifically designed to capture and save emails.\n\nMailStore Home, for one, is a free piece of Windows software that can back up mail from any internet account, servers such as Microsoft Exchange, or email clients including Mozilla Thunderbird. The tool creates an archive that lets you search both messages and attachments, and it has a one-click export feature can restore emails in bulk or individually.\n\nFor remote access to your email data, consider the Dropmyemail service, which for $1.67 a month will keep a secure, searchable archive of your emails in the cloud. Once it's synced with an email account (the service supports all the top email providers), you can download and restore messages or migrate them to a new server. \u00a0\n\nIf you use the popular photo-sharing site, remember that your Yahoo credentials are also your Flickr credentials, so deleting Yahoo will also wipe out your pics.\n\nTo download your photos, go to Camera Roll view; click \"Select All\" and then \"Download.\" You'll be left with a .zip archive file, which you can extract on your desktop or upload to Google Photos. \u00a0\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2005-2016 Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.

This amounts to more than one shooting a week.\n\nBy comparison, there were a total of 44 school shootings from 1996 to 2008 - equivalent to around one a year, the authors note.\n\nDuring the three-year study period, 39 states had at least one school shooting, while 11 had none: Alaska; Connecticut; Hawaii; New Hampshire; New Jersey; New York; North Dakota; Rhode Island; Vermont; West Virginia; and Wyoming.\n\nFive states had more than 10 shootings during the study period: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, where the numbers were 14, 15, 12, 10 and 14 shootings, respectively.\n\nOverall, 84 people, including 27 perpetrators died, and another 136 were injured. Most of the shootings were intentional and perpetrated by men.\n\nResearchers lacked data on a lot of factors that can influence gun violence, but they did find fewer school shootings occurred in states with mandatory background checks and higher spending on mental health and education.\n\nOne limitation of the study is its reliance on news coverage of shootings for data used in the analysis, which might not offer a complete picture of every incident or include every shooting, the authors note.\n\nThey also had no way to determine the mental state or access to health care for perpetrators in these shootings.\n\n\"Mental health problems can increase the risk of both perpetration and victimization from violence, including weapon-related violence,\" said Dr. Rashmi Shetgiri, a pediatrics researcher at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\"Mental health interventions have been shown to reduce involvement in aggressive and violent behavior among children and adolescents,\" Shetgiri, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. \"Investment in mental health services, therefore, could be beneficial for preventing violence and for dealing with the consequences of exposure to weapon violence.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.5656566619873, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 513, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 9, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.5519397904799996, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 13, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.53411306042885, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.1818181818200002}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/02/iraqi-forces-kill-8-isis-militants-in-mosul-as-civilians-cleared-out.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Iraqi forces kill 8 ISIS militants in Mosul as civilians cleared out", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1052, "date": "20161102190000", "story_content": "Iraqi special forces paused their advance in an eastern district of Mosul on Wednesday to clear a neighborhood of any remaining Islamic State militants, killing eight while carrying out house-to-house clearances.\n\nSix of the militants were killed inside a tunnel in the newly-recaptured Gogjali neighborhood, while the other two were shot dead as they advanced on troops, Lt. Col. Muhanad al-Timimi of the Iraqi special forces told The Associated Press. One of the militants was wearing an explosives-laden vest, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of civilians cleared out of the adjacent neighborhood of al-Samah, some carrying white flags. All the women were wearing the niqab, a veil that entirely covers the face or only has a small, slit-like opening for the eyes, and all the men had long beards. ISIS strictly enforces an Islamic a dress code in territory it holds.\n\nThroughout the day, special forces could be seen going house to house in Gogjali, Mosul's easternmost district, while sappers searched the road for explosives and booby traps left behind by the jihadis driven out a day earlier.\n\nGen. Abdul-Ghani al-Asadi, the top counterterrorism forces commander, told reporters a curfew had been imposed in the neighborhood while gains there were being consolidated.\n\n\"We fear that Daesh militants could attack our forces or the town with mortars,\" he said, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS. \"So for the safety of the families we ask them to stay inside their houses.\" He spoke in the town of Bartella, some 9 miles behind the front lines.\n\nBrig. Gen. Haider Fadhil said that no advances were planned while high humidity and clouds obscured the view of aircraft and drones \u2014 a key component to the operations provided by a U.S.-led air campaign.\n\nThe guns were largely silent during the day in Gogjali, which is inside Mosul's city limits but just outside more urban districts, although sporadic rifle cracks could be heard as well as some army artillery fire on ISIS positions. Fadhil said special forces had detained three suspected ISIS militants in the area.\n\nThe pause came a day after Iraqi troops set foot in the city for the first time in more than two years, gearing up for urban warfare expected to take weeks, if not months.\n\nIn the next stage, troops will have to navigate streets likely lined with booby traps, fighting house to house while trying to avoid killing civilians, more than one million of whom are still in the city.\n\nFurther to the south, where progress has been much slower, Federal Police forces captured four small villages outside the Hamam al-Alil area, over 19 miles from Mosul, the army said. The largest of the four is Min Gar, some 6 miles west of Hamam al-Alil, spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool said of the Wednesday morning operation.\n\nMosul is the last major ISIS stronghold in Iraq, and driving the militant group from the city would be a major blow to its ambitions of creating a cross-border \"caliphate\" stretching into Syria. ISIS announced the project in Mosul in 2014, after it routed the much larger Iraqi military, which had been neglected and demoralized by corruption.\n\nHowever, concern over the fate of civilians caught up in the fighting has been growing, after residents reported that ISIS militants were rounding up thousands of people to use as human shields and killing those with suspected links to the security forces.\n\nAccording to one account given to the AP, the fighters went door to door in villages south of Mosul, ordering hundreds of people at gunpoint to march north into the city, where urban fighting is expected to be heaviest and the presence of civilians will slow the army's advance as it tries to avoid killing innocents.\n\nIn the latest international condemnation of ISIS, which has carried out mass killings of perceived opponents in the past and boasted about them in grisly photos and videos circulated online, the United Nations called on authorities to collect evidence of ISIS abuses of civilians for future use by tribunals.\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council warned that more than 1 million civilians trapped inside Mosul \"are in grave danger\" as Iraqi troops advance into the city.\n\nThe aid group, which works with refugees and internally displaced people, said that around 18,000 Iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the massive Mosul military operation over two weeks ago.\n\nIts Iraq chief, Wolfgang Gressmann, said the agency's aid workers were \"bracing ... for the worst.\"\n\n\"The lives of 1.2 million civilians are in grave danger, and the future of all of Iraq is now in the balance,\" he said\n\nAdama Dieng, special adviser to the U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the prevention of genocide, also expressed concern over \"the increasing risk\" of sectarian violence or revenge attacks during the Mosul campaign, especially where state-sanctioned Iraqi Shiite militias are approaching Sunni communities.\n\n\"Any kind of retaliatory violence against individuals on the basis of their membership of a specific group is unacceptable,\" he said in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nPolitical rhetoric on the issue has been heating up, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently warned that Turkey would be closely monitoring Shiite militias' behavior in northern Iraq and seeking to safeguard the rights of ethnic Turkmens there. Erdogan said the Iraqi Shiite militias could prompt a Turkish response if they \"terrorize\" the Iraqi-Turkmen town of Tal-Afar.\n\nOn Tuesday, Turkey's defense minister said his country was making preparations for \"all kinds of possibilities\" as the Turkish military began deploying tanks and other vehicles to the border town of Silopi.\n\nIn a televised speech later that evening to praise the Mosul operation, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi downplayed an escalation. \"We don't want war with Turkey. We do not want confrontation with Turkey,\" he said. But if it happens, \"we are ready.\"\n\nSeparately, Amnesty International said government-sanctioned tribal Sunni fighters taking part in the Mosul operation had carried out revenge attacks against men and boys they suspected of being ISIS militants in newly-liberated areas.\n\nFighters from the Sabawi tribe, originally from Mosul, unlawfully rounded up civilians, beat them with metal rods, gave them electric shocks and tied some of them to the bonnets of vehicles and paraded through the streets or placed in cages, the London-based group said in a report based on interviews with local officials and eyewitnesses.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.38489198684692, "HarmVice": 19, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1009, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.621681757719999, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161102190000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.46878097125867, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/22/in-israel-oily-hanukkah-treat-outlasts-health-campaign.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [72]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 593, "scraper_regex": 641}}, "headline": "In Israel, an oily Hanukkah treat outlasts a health campaign", "wordcount_as_scraped": 641, "date": "20161222170000", "story_content": "JERUSALEM \u2013 \u00a0Israelis are finding a new campaign by their crusading health minister hard to swallow: in the name of proper nutrition, he has gone on the warpath against the nation's beloved Hanukkah tradition of gorging on sugar-laden, deep-fried, jam-filled doughnuts.\n\nAs head of a powerful ultra-Orthodox political party, the bearded and black-coated Yaakov Litzman considers himself a guardian of Jewish traditions. But in his other hat, he's a health-conscious official on a mission to stamp out junk food and child obesity.\n\nLitzman's two roles have come into conflict with his high-profile call to avoid the lure of the high-calorie \"sufgania\" doughnut.\n\n\"I call on the public to avoid eating sufganiyot, which are rich in fats,\" Litzman told a conference last week promoting healthy eating. \"You can find alternatives for everything nowadays and there is no need for us to fatten our children.\"\n\nBURGER KING ISRAEL CELEBRATES HANUKKAH WITH DOUGHNUT WHOPPER\n\nAs part of his health food drive, Litzman has campaigned to have sugary drinks removed from schools and taken on fast food giant McDonald's \u2014 earning public praise for promoting proper nutrition.\n\n\"McDonald's out. Not in our country,\" he said, in a refrain that went viral.\n\nBut going after doughnuts during Hanukkah is something else entirely.\n\nFor most Israelis, eating the sufgania is as essential to celebrating Hanukkah as lighting the menorah and spinning the dreidel.\n\nAlong with the latke \u2014 a fried potato pancake \u2014 it is the delicacy most associated with the eight-day holiday that commemorates ancient miracles and a triumph over oppression. Taking a page from the playbook of the ancient Maccabees who inspired the holiday, many are resisting Litzman's campaign.\n\n\"You have to eat it, but in proportion. It's yummy, it's good, it's the season,\" said Gideon Haba, a doughnut seller in the Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem. \"I don't believe he (Litzman) meant it. It's like not lighting the candles. He just wanted to send a message.\"\n\nSHOULD CHRISTIANS CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS AND HANUKKAH?\n\nYosef Lipsman, a customer buying his first doughnut of the year, said the tradition was harmless as long as you don't go overboard.\n\n\"White flour is not great for you, but it's all a matter of how much,\" he said. \"You can enjoy it once in a while.\"\n\nLitzman declined a request for comment.\n\nHanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, commemorates the Jewish uprising in the second century B.C. against the Greek-Syrian kingdom, which tried to force its culture on Jews and desecrated the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nThe holiday lasts eight days because \u2014 according to tradition \u2014 when the Jews rededicated the Temple in Jerusalem, one vial of oil, enough for one day, burned for eight days instead.\n\nHence the tradition of eating oily foods.\n\nA sufgania is essentially a ball of dough deep fried in oil, packed with strawberry jelly and sprinkled with sugar. Other versions are alternatively filled with chocolate spread, cappuccino or dulce de leche.\n\nFAITH-BASED CRUISES BRING THE SPIRIT ALIVE FOR MANY RELIGIONS\n\nIn recent years, it has become trendy for bakeries to offer embellished versions that are topped with marshmallows, crumbled cookies, pralines, popping candy and whipped cream. Some include a syringe that can inject toffee, pistachio cream and even vodka into the doughnut for an additional kick.\n\nThe upgrades have created a 100 gram (3.5 ounces) doughnut that can contain as much as 500 calories.\n\nBurger King recently jumped on the bandwagon by introducing its \"SufganiKing\" \u2014 a standard Whopper stuffed between two doughnuts.\n\nAt a Roladin bakery in Jerusalem, dozens of elaborate versions were laid out on display.\n\n\"Maybe they are fat ... but they are good. That's the reason why they're good,\" said Haim Newman, a customer. \"My family came from a long, long tradition of baking and my father always says what his grandfather told him before: 'If you want something good, it has to be fat.'\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.62962961196899, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 593, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.0164611829799997, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.69814502529511, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/02/cancer-drugs-may-remain-approved-despite-lack-benefit.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 653, "scraper_regex": 686}}, "headline": "Cancer drugs may remain approved despite lack of benefit", "wordcount_as_scraped": 686, "date": "20161202140000", "story_content": "- In the United States, cancer drugs are sometimes approved through sped-up processes - and they often stay approved even if later studies show them to be inferior to other options or even worse than doing nothing, a new study found.\n\nResearchers evaluated studies done on 18 cancer drugs approved between 2008 and 2012 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). None of the drugs had been found to prolong life, and only one had enough evidence to say it improved quality of life. Yet, all but one retained its approval status.\n\n\"We were shocked to find that these drugs don't save lives and don't improve quality of lives,\" said senior author Diana Zuckerman, who is president of the National Center for Health Research and the Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund in Washington, D.C.\n\nTo ensure a cancer treatment's safety and quickly get it to market, the FDA sometimes approves a drug if it meets \"surrogate\" research goals instead of the gold-standard endpoints the agency usually looks for. Surrogate endpoints - like tumor shrinkage and time until the disease progresses - don't take as many years to document as those used in the traditional approval process, so the drug can get on the market sooner.\n\n\"We don't really know if people live longer or improve based on those outcomes,\" said Dr. Vinay Prasad, of the Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland. In a 2015 study, Prasad and colleagues found that 36 cancer drugs were approved by the FDA between 2008 and 2012 based on those early endpoints.\n\nOf those 36 approved drugs, 18 did not help patients live longer, later studies showed.\n\nFor the new study, Zuckerman and her colleague Tracy Rupp analyzed additional data on those 18 drugs to estimate their costs and to see if they at least improved patients' quality of life.\n\nThe price of the drugs ranged from about $20,000 to nearly $170,000, the researchers estimated in a report in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nThey analyzed 31 clinical trials, but could not find publicly available evidence evaluating five of the drugs.\n\nOf the remaining 13 drugs, the researchers found evidence that one improved quality of life, compared to other treatments. Six of the drugs produced results no different than other drugs, placebos or no intervention. Two drugs resulted in worse quality of life compared to nothing or placebo. Four drugs produced mixed results compared to other drugs or placebos.\n\nBut while the drugs could not be shown to help patients live longer or lead higher quality lives, only bevacizumab, known commercially as Genentech's Avastin, lost its approval for treating breast cancer, according to the authors. It remains available for other uses, however.\n\nZuckerman noted that a drug can be approved for more than one use. In some cases, a drug may be more effective for one health condition than another.\n\n\"I think their results are very sobering,\" Prasad told Reuters Health.\n\nHe said the results show the U.S. isn't doing a good job on post-market analysis, but more investigation is needed to know who is responsible for the shortcoming.\n\n\"In following the principle of 'first, do no harm,' the FDA should promptly withdraw approval for cancer drugs that are proven to have no clinical benefit,\" JAMA Internal Medicine editors Drs. Scott Bauer and Rita Redberg write in a note accompanying the new study.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters Health, the FDA said people with resistant cancers have few or no therapeutic options, and the agency takes that into account when examining the risks and benefits of these drugs.\n\n\"It has been widely accepted that benefit can be demonstrated by a number of endpoints, not just overall survival,\" according to the statement.\n\n\"When a drug is approved under the accelerated approval pathway, sponsors have been required to study the drug further, to verify and characterize its clinical benefit,\" read the statement. The agency added that it does not set drug prices.\n\nZuckerman told Reuters Health that doctors are increasingly passing the message to their patients that treatments aren't necessarily better just because they're new.\n\n\"Don't assume the newest most-expensive drug is the best one,\" she said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.64835166931152, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 653, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.8763424946, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.45022970903522, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/science/2016/12/19/rare-horse-and-rider-statue-based-on-da-vinci-model-goes-on-show.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [246, 325, 733, 875, 1026, 1511, 1659, 1767, 2214, 2387, 2691, 2821, 2980, 3304, 3384, 3536, 3537, 3731, 4027, 4714]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 766, "scraper_regex": 850}}, "headline": "Rare horse and rider statue based on da Vinci model goes on show", "wordcount_as_scraped": 850, "date": "20161219180000", "story_content": "It has been an extraordinary journey across time, and even an ocean, for one weary renaissance horse and rider. And for lovers of Leonardo da Vinci, their journey also now continues.\u00a0 There is another masterpiece to seek out and behold. But catch it if you can!\u00a0 Because it won't sit still.\n\nThe artist from the town of Vinci, Italy, known most famously, for his paintings, \"The Mona Lisa\" and \"The Last Supper,\" produced so much more.\n\n\"Before Leonardo was an artist, he was a sculptor, and that's where he actually got his training, as a sculptor,\" said Rod Maly, a Las Vegas-based art dealer who owns a rare statue that ultimately derives from the hands of Leonardo.\u00a0 \"And it's a remarkable story about how we have it,\" he added.\n\nThe small bronze of a horse and rider is now making its way around the world.\u00a0 It was cast from a beeswax model attributed to Leonardo, created in the early 1500's, but that, as far as experts know, was never made into a statue.\u00a0 The rider was thought to be the French governor of Milan at that time, Charles d'Amboise.\n\nLeonardo was cast out from his native Tuscany, one common legend goes, because he was homosexual, which was illegal in those days. He presented himself as a jack-of-all-trades to the Duke of the rival region of Milan. His resume listed in great detail his skills as an arms designer. Only at the very end of his resume, did he mention that in times of peace, he could also paint and decorate.\u00a0 And there was so much more.\n\nDA VINCI DISCOVERY: RARE DRAWING, VALUED AT $16 MILLION, FOUND\n\nMaly told Fox News, \"He was so far ahead of his time.\u00a0 He was the inventor of the diving suit, the helicopter (at least the original prototype), the machine gun.\u00a0 Much of his time was spent as an inventor, a medical man.\"\n\nLeonardo's crowning achievement in Milan turned out, in fact, to be a painting, the skill he flogged least. \"The Last Supper,\" a fresco the Duke commissioned him to paint in the refectory of a monastery in what is now central Milan, draws enormous crowds, day after day. Shortly after he completed \"The Last Supper,\" toward the end of the 1400's, the French invaded, and Leonardo fled.\u00a0 But he eventually returned to Milan, this time at the invitation of the French.\n\nAfter his death, his belongings were left to his assistant and companion, Francesco Melzi.\u00a0 Among the works bequeathed, that beeswax model for what is believed was meant to be a monument to Charles D'Amboise.\n\nDeteriorating over time, it passed from relatives of its inheritor, to descendants, and went from one private collection to another, to Switzerland for safekeeping during World War II.\u00a0 In 1985, a British arts and antiques dealer bought it from the Swiss man whose family had acquired it from the Melzi collection.\u00a0 It was Leonardo scholar Carlo Pedretti, who led the drive to identify the wax work as a true Leonardo, who ultimately convinced the British dealer to buy it.\u00a0 This was after Pedretti got photos of it published in a book of Leonardo sketches owned by Queen Elizabeth, upping the profile of the fast-deteriorating work of art.\n\nDA VINCI DISCOVERED: ART SLEUTHING REVEALS LEONARDO ENGRAVING\n\nIn 1985, a mold of the compromised beeswax model was made, in order to preserve some legacy.\u00a0 By now, the haggard horse was missing a leg, and the rider-his hands and feet.\u00a0 In the late 80's an Indiana businessman bought the beeswax model and the latex mold. Some 25 years later, the bronze was cast, in Burbank, California.\u00a0\u00a0Maly and his business partner Jim Petty bought the mold and bronze for an undisclosed sum.\n\nMaly said, \"This is remarkable, because we have been able to take a piece of history and preserve it.\u00a0 Nothing like that has ever been done before. This was a piece of beeswax in 1985, and there was a mold of latex made to preserve it for eternity, and we have the original from that latex mold.\"\n\nIts new home is a vault in Las Vegas. But The Horse and Rider have been let loose for a world tour.\u00a0 Maly is thrilled to show off this relatively unknown connection to the great genius, whose gifts he describes with great emotion.\n\n\"Why is the Mona Lisa the most revered artwork in the world? Why is the portrait of a relatively normal renaissance woman the most revered artwork in the world? It's magic,\" he said. \"It's because there are things within our psyche, within the universe, that we don't understand, and Leonardo tapped into that, in all his artworks, and that is why he is a great artist.\"\n\nAnd The Horse and Rider are now charging around to spread the message that Leonardo was also an important sculptor.\n\nThe statue is at the Institut Francais in Milan until Dec. 23rd. \u00a0\n\n\n\nAmy Kellogg currently serves as a Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent based in Milan, Italy.

Every hour, about 40 children die on roads around the world, many on foot, according to the World Health Organization.\n\n\"We need to stop our practice of thinking myopically by focusing just around schools and start thinking about how we make our entire cities safer,\" Ferenchak told Reuters Health by email. \"This is not just a transportation issue but a planning/land use issue as well.\"\n\nFerenchak and a coauthor looked at National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data on crashes in six cities between 1982 and 2012 for children under age 18 to identify where fatalities typically occur. Then they used GIS mapping to evaluate the quarter-mile surrounding parks to compare fatality rates to those around schools and the city as a whole.\n\nThey focused on the country's fastest-growing regions - the South and the West - and the cities there with the largest proportionate increases in population, on the theory that new infrastructure could affect the way schools, parks and trails are included in communities.\n\nThe analysis included Austin, Dallas and Houston in Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver and Los Angeles, and in all six cities, fatality risk around parks was found to be 1.16 to 1.81 times that of the city overall.\n\nResearchers also found that fatalities near parks were 1.04 to 2.23 times more common compared to the vicinity of schools, with Dallas showing the biggest difference.\n\n\"This comes at a critically important time when we're seeing changes in U.S. transportation funding and a changing menu of options that states can choose from,\" said Charles DiMaggio, an director of injury research at the New York University School of Medicine, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"We know that enforcement and education are important, but engineering is the most expensive and effective way to protect kids,\" he told Reuters Health by email. \"We need, more than anything, to evaluate all of these efforts.\"\n\nOne limitation of the study, the researchers acknowledge, is that specific child pedestrian exposure numbers are hard to track accurately by geographic area. They are likely to vary by age, and may vary by city.\n\n\"If you're 5 years old, you're likely not far from home if you get injured,\" DiMaggio said. \"But if you're 14 or 15, you're roaming more widely, which is tough to measure.\"\n\nThe study team suggests that solutions to the problem lie in the realms of transportation and urban design. Just as reduced speed limits and pedestrian crossings in school zones have lowered child pedestrian injury rates, similar transportation measures around parks could reduce fatalities.\n\nHowever, that won't help in areas with major highways. In several cities studied, parks were often located near roads with four or six lanes and speeds above 70 miles per hour, Ferenchak noted. Instead, parks should be placed on slow, narrow roads in neighborhoods.\n\n\"Although I talk about expanding our considerations beyond schools, that is not a slight at the research being done around schools in the least,\" he said. \"We'd like to build collaborations with Safe Routes to School because they have many important findings and best practices that could be applied in parks as well.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.4320456981658904, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 635, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.90340353139, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.6771653543307097, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/10/its-trump-post-election-blueprint-for-evangelical-conservatives.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [5676]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 818, "scraper_regex": 965}}, "headline": "It's Trump: A post-election blueprint for evangelical conservatives", "wordcount_as_scraped": 965, "date": "20161110060000", "story_content": "The long road to Super Tuesday is over. Donald J. Trump has been elected the 45th President of the United States. Evangelical reaction is mixed. On the one hand, many evangelicals (including the authors of this article) opposed Trump's nomination. On the other hand, many white evangelicals supported his campaign.\n\nRegardless, there are two things upon which evangelicals can agree.\n\nFirst, we can agree that in recent decades, evangelicals have been decentered socially and culturally. Although we have seen incremental progress in our advocacy for the pro-life cause, we are experiencing consistent setbacks on other significant concerns such as religious liberty, race relations, and marriage and family. More to the point, many Americans consider our stance on moral issues to be not only wrong but bad, and view us as little more than the hypocritical and bigoted special interest arm of the Republican Party.\n\nSecond, for the next four years, our evangelical witness and action will take place in the context of a Trump presidency. That fact should not alter our political vision and mission. Administrations come and go; the Christian mission remains the same. Therefore, we should be able to unify our public witness around four directives: reassessing our priorities, reframing political issues, reinvigorating our commitment to social causes, and persevering even if the decks are stacked against us.\n\nReassessing our Priorities\n\nThe Christian \"gospel\" is the announcement that Jesus Christ is Lord; that he suffered and died on a cross to pay the penalty for our sins; that he rose from the dead and appeared publicly to many people; and that he will return one day as King to institute a world order characterized by love, peace, and justice. As evangelicals, we must ensure that our political initiatives serve as a preview of that world order.\n\nOne way to do that is to continue our commitment to the causes we are known for, such as demanding justice and equality for unborn babies and protecting religious liberty for all citizens.\n\nBut there are other ways too. We must find compelling ways to show that the Bible's narrative\u2014rather than the political narrative of a cable news network\u2014is the true story of the whole world. We must be quick to identify the false gods and saviors offered up by every modern political ideology, including liberalism, conservatism and progressivism, nationalism, and socialism. We must find ways to make clear that our allegiance to Jesus Christ takes precedence over our allegiance to any particular political ideology, party, or platform.\n\nReframing Political Issues\n\nThe United States is as divided as it has ever been. Our political discourse is toxic. Our trust in public institutions is at an all-time low. Our differences on political issues are so great that we've demonized each other. But evangelicals, because of our commitment to the gospel, are poised to speak a good word into a bad situation.\n\nOur commitment to the gospel means that we can \"reframe\" political issues so that they can be seen in a new light. For example, the gospel reframes our approach to wealth by revealing that wealth is neither our savior nor our ultimate security, and by causing us to be radically generous to the economically disadvantaged. Similarly, it reframes our approach to power by causing us\u2014counterintuitively\u2014to lovingly serve and empower others by decentering ourselves.\n\nThis type of \"reframing\" of political issues will break the ability of American society to dismiss evangelicals by classifying us as the special interest arm of any one political party. It does not mean that we should renounce our membership within a political party; it means that we can work for the betterment of our party.\n\nReinvigorating Social Action\n\nThe late great evangelical Francis Schaeffer argued, in his book \"The Great Evangelical Disaster,\" that American evangelicals have been beset by deficiency in response to two realities: racism and poverty. Schaeffer is right: we must do better. The gospel demands it and our nation needs it.\n\nIn regard to race and poverty, evangelical conservatives should take the reins in our own political party. We should demand that our political candidates speak openly and consistently about racial prejudices and injustices, whether the victims be black, white, Hispanic, or other. In regard to wealth, we should place poverty at the top of the list of our talking points and agendas for action. As evangelical conservatives, we cannot ignore our brothers and sisters who are persons of color and we cannot look the other way when our fellow citizens are desperately poor.\n\nWe must disprove the reigning political narrative that says evangelicals do not care about persons who are financially disadvantaged, ethnically downtrodden, or socially marginalized. We must find evangelical conservative ways of working on their behalf.\n\nEmbracing our Position of Weakness\n\nEvangelicals must embrace the era in which the Lord has placed us, an era in which we and our concerns have been decentered. Instead of resenting the moment, slouching into bitter withdrawal, or charging into angry activism, we embrace the challenge to work for evangelical causes, even from a position of cultural weakness.\n\nAfter all, our Lord reigned from a tree. And if he reigned from a tree, evangelical conservatives can also serve our great nation even\u2014and especially\u2014from a position of cultural weakness.\n\n\n\nBruce Ashford is the Provost and Dean of Faculty at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, where he also serves as Professor of Theology and Culture.\u00a0 He co-authored the recently-released \"One Nation Under God: A Christian Hope for American Politics\" (B&H Academic, Dec. 2015) with Chris Pappalardo.

What if people talked more about videotapes, emails, private behavior and public deception than they did about issues that arise under the Constitution?

What if he believes that the federal government can right any wrong, regulate any behavior and tax any event, no matter what the Constitution says?\n\nWhat if candidate Trump called Obamacare the worst political experiment and assault on health care in American history? What if the core of Obamacare is the individual mandate (which forces all Americans to have health insurance), the pre-existing conditions mandate (which forces insurance carriers to insure the uninsurable, against all free market principles) and the child coverage mandate (which forces insurance carriers to allow for the insuring of the children of insured parents until the children reach age 26)?\n\nWhat if those three mandates have contributed to the increased cost of health insurance and the decreased availability of the services of medical professionals? What if President-elect Trump now supports those three mandates, against which he railed aggressively and vociferously when he was a candidate?\n\nWhat if he supports President Barack Obama's claimed right to use drones to kill Americans who have not been charged or convicted of any crime when they are in foreign countries? What if Trump believes he can legally torture Americans, not as punishment for the commission of a crime but to extract information from them? What if he believes he can kill the innocent spouses and children of those foreigners who are harming American interests? What if torture for any purpose and knowingly targeting innocents for death are war crimes and the president is not immune from being prosecuted for them? What if Trump, like Obama before him, believes he can lock people up without charges or a trial or access to the courts?\n\nWhat if on Thanksgiving, instead of thanking, we engage in thinking -- about human freedom, limited government and government fidelity to the Constitution that created it? What if, while being thankful for life and liberty, we think about ways to preserve them? What if we recognize that when our government breaks its own laws, it assaults the fabric of our republic? What if we are thankful for the recognition of that?\n\nWhat if on Thanksgiving we re-evaluate the relationship of the individual to the state? What if we begin by demanding that the government work for us and not the other way around? What if instead of just accepting the new government, we try to limit it?\n\nWhat if we advance the idea that the individual has an immortal soul and the government is a temporary organization based on a monopoly of force? What if we can cause the government to recognize that because our souls are immortal, there are vast areas of human behavior in which we do not need a government permission slip in order to make personal choices? What if we call these choices in these areas natural rights?\n\nWhat if the best government is the one that taxes, spends and regulates the least? What if the best government recognizes our natural rights? What if the best government leaves us alone? What if that would be something to be thankful for?\n\n\n\nAndrew P.

Cuts to physician reimbursements automatically reduce the availability of physicians. As Robert Moffitt of Heritage Foundation testified before Congress in 2009, \"You can't get more of something by paying less for it.\"\n\nMore insured patients plus fewer available doctors equals longer and longer wait times. That is why 752 residents of President Obama's home state of Illinois died: they had to wait too long to get life-saving care that was not available in time. This is called death by queueing, something U.S. veterans experience every day.\n\nObamaCare has aided the growth of the malignancy that is destroying U.S. health care: a massive federal administrative apparatus and regulatory machine that diverts trillions\u2014not millions or even billions\u2014of \"health care\" dollars away from health care services to pay itself, to pay the health care bureaucracy.\n\nThere is another, even more compelling, reason to repeal ObamaCare. Health care is not the fed's job! Providing health care is not a federal responsibility according to the U.S. Constitution and the Medicaid law.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads, \"The powers not delegated to the United States [the federal government] \u2026 are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" As the Constitution does not grant control of health care to Washington, health care should be \"reserved to the States.\"\n\nThe original 1965 Medicaid law created a \"jointly funded, state administered\" program. Note the phrase state administered. Over five decades, the federal government has gradually taken control of every aspect of supposedly state-run Medicaid programs. Not only should the states control health care within their borders according to the Constitution, but the Medicaid law also explicitly legislated local, i.e., state, control of each program.\n\nThe problems of health care delivery in Texas are not the same as those in Connecticut or in Oregon. Every management expert will tell you that the lower down in the power structure you put decision-making authority, the more responsive, more effective, and more efficient an organization or a system like health care will be. Local control always achieves better outcomes than a distant centralized, one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nWho has a better understanding of the health care needs of people in South Texas: a federal bureaucrat sitting in a cubicle at 200 Independence Avenue, Washington, D.C. (headquarters of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) or the state representative from South Texas and the voters in Hidalgo county?\n\nIf Congress repeals ObamaCare, what should they replace it with? That is the hot question-of-the-moment. There is a one-word answer.\n\nWhat should Congress replace ObamaCare with? Nothing! I write again, Nothing!\n\nLet the states decide how best to care for their people. Let the states organize health care activities within their borders and make whatever deals they like across borderlines.\n\nFinally, should Washington continue to provide health care funding if the states control their health care? That is another story, a big one that requires more elaboration than the remaining word limit for this article allows. Stay tuned. \u00a0\n\n\n\nDr. Deane Waldman, MD MBA, is Emeritus Professor of Pediatrics, Pathology and Decision Science, and Director of the Center for Health Care Policy at the Texas Public Policy Foundation as well as the author of The Cancer in the American Healthcare System.

Ray Kelly said.\n\n\"Where was my son or daughter? Where were they standing? How come they didn't get out?\" he said. \"Families want answers. They need answers.\"\n\nThe fire broke out during a dance party Friday night in the cluttered warehouse.\n\nThe structure had been converted to artists' studios and illegal living spaces, and former denizens said it was a death trap of piled wood, furniture, snaking electrical cords and only two exits.\n\nDanielle Boudreaux, a 40-year-old hairdresser who was close with Derick Ion Almena, the founder of the artists' colony, and his partner, Micah Allison, said it was full of extension cords plugged into each other that helped supply power to music equipment, microwaves and hot plates.\n\nThere were also RVs inside, she said.\n\nAlmena has not responded to emails or calls by The Associated Press to phone numbers associated with him. He has said he didn't attend the event Friday night, and he is sorry.\n\nCity and state officials fielded complaints for years about dangerous conditions, drugs, neglected children, trash, thefts and squabbles at the warehouse, raising questions about why it wasn't shut down. The district attorney has warned of possible murder charges as she determines whether there were any crimes linked to the blaze.\n\nThe fire has cast a spotlight on similar artists' colonies around the country that offer cheap housing but have raised safety concerns among neighbors and city officials.\n\nOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said the city will look to strengthen regulations for smoke alarms and exits and clarify city employees' responsibilities to monitor unsafe structures.\n\nShe said the city wants to engage the arts community in the review to ensure any changes don't jeopardize their access to affordable housing and work space.\n\nOn Wednesday, an Oakland restaurant owner, Dorothy King, called a news conference to say she was concerned the artists' warehouse next to her business could pose a safety hazard.\n\nSeveral artists tried to shout her down, accusing her of launching a \"witch hunt\" that could result in artists' collectives being shut down.\n\nKing said that wasn't her intention.\n\n\"I'm concerned about my business burning down.

As a result, the Trump administration suggested to Nieto it would be best to bag a planned meeting next week between the leaders. Nieto took the president's offer and will stay home, though Trump later said they \"agreed\" to do so.\n\nRep. Will Hurd., R-Texas, represents 800 miles of the border with Mexico in his district. The second-term lawmaker is suspect of the entire wall concept.\n\n\"It is impossible to build a physical wall in much of (this) terrain. Big Bend National Park and many areas in my district are perfect examples of where a wall is unnecessary and would negatively impact the environment, private property rights and (the) economy,\" he said. \"Building a wall is the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border.\"\n\nBut, congressional Republicans forge ahead. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., \u00a0indicated they'll prep a \"supplemental\" spending bill to cover the construction.\n\nThis is what's clear. A \"supplemental\" spending bill is an extra measure in the annual appropriations process.\n\nTo best understand this, let's head to the kitchen.\n\nThink of a pie, sliced into 12 uneven pieces. Those slices represent the 12 annual spending bills that Congress must approve to fund the federal government each year. The largest pie slice pays for the Pentagon. \n\nIn fact, the military piece constitutes nearly half the entire pie. The smallest slice funds the legislative branch. In between are pie pieces that fund Commerce, Justice & Science programs, the Departments of Labor and Health & Human Services, the Department of the Interior and so on.\n\nCongress must pass all of those bills by September 30, the end of the government's fiscal year. If not, the government shuts down. Sometimes, just that section (or a pie slice) of the federal government shutters if Congress and the president failed to reach accord on an individual bill.\n\nBut here's the rub. A \"supplemental\" bill is just that. You have the annual appropriations pie divided into 12, unequal pieces. And then across the counter on another plate is an additional, standa-lone slab of pie, \u00a0\u2013 which wasn't cut from the original pie. The piece could be rather slim, or a chunk with fruit filling spilling out of the crust.\n\nCongress typically approves a supplemental appropriations bill (or a \"supp,\" in Capitol Hill speak) when lawmakers need money for emergency programs outside the bounds of the original spending pie. A \"supp\" is often necessary after a national crisis (like September 11th), wars or natural disasters.\u00a0\n\nCongress repeatedly approved multiple supplemental-spending bills to fund the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11. The money appropriated in a supplemental bill is \"real\" and does in fact contribute to the national debt.\n\nAnd here's an interesting factoid. Money allocated on an emergency basis in a \"supp\" isn't subject to otherwise mandatory spending caps applied to conventional legislation. But if this additional bill is just an \"extra\" measure (lacking the \"emergency\" designation), the dollars do count against the caps.\n\nThis new money isn't off the books. But Congress doesn't constrict emergency supplemental spending the way it does garden variety spending.\n\nCongress engineered a major package to hike the debt ceiling in the summer of 2011.\n\nSince then, Congress operated under spending caps known as \"sequestration.\" In essence, these caps limited the size of the overall piece and constricted the size of each pie slice. The sequestration budget-limiting measures were supposed to apply only through fiscal 2021 and save $1.1 trillion. However, Congress has routinely kicked the can down the road, adding years to sequestration so lawmakers can spend now. A good example of this came in late 2013. \n\nThen-House Budget Committee Chairman Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., extended sequestration by two years in their budget accord. Ryan and Murray did this so sequestration didn't hem in lawmakers on other spending.\n\nMcConnell and Ryan repeatedly dodged questions at Thursday's press conference in Philadelphia about whether they'll offset the cost of the wall. McConnell said \"we intend to address the wall issue ourselves.\"\n\nThe president argues the wall will cost $10 billion. Some estimates are as high as $25 billion. Consider the fact that the price tag of the original House Pentagon spending bill last year hit $517.1 billion. The U.S. is now $21 trillion in debt. McConnell mentioned a price tag of \u00a0$12 to $15 billion. So, $10 to $25 billion is not a lot in federal terms. But it's also not nothing, either.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) this week spelled out some damning figures about the country's economic outlook if Congress doesn't soon harness spending.\n\nThe federal debt exploded in recent years because Congress spent trillions in the war on terror, Iraq and in Afghanistan. Entitlement spending (which constitutes a completely different pie, which dwarfs our original pie in size) also drives the debt on a yearly basis.\n\nLate Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer asserted the president now wants to impose a border tax on Mexico to pay for the wall.\n\n\"That's really going to provide the funding,\" he said.\n\nTrump's spokesman later mopped up those comments, indicating that a levy on services coming across the border with Mexico was just a possible method of paying for the wall.\n\nBut the question is whether conservative lawmakers (many of whom are pro-trade) will tolerate additional spending. A border wall sounds nice to constituents back home. But they also balk at extra spending.\n\n\"I generally don't vote for anything that's not offset,\" said Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho. \"Everything needs an offset.\"\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, says he opposes tariffs like the one Spicer mentioned. However, he also expected construction of the wall to be \"fiscally sound.\" Still, even Meadows slightly cracked the door open to conservatives not requiring immediate offsets to construct the wall.\n\n\"I know that we're committed to making sure the funds and resources are there,\" he said in Philadelphia.\n\nIt will be interesting to watch how budget hawks in Congress tangle with the wall's cost.\n\nAn internal debate now rages among Republicans as to how they cut taxes, add tens of billions to the debt by repealing ObamaCare, bulking up the military and engineering a robust infrastructure bill - all while slashing federal spending.\n\nMoreover, a 2015 pact between then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and then-President Obama suspended the debt ceiling (the total amount of red ink the US can carry at any one time) until mid-March.\n\nIt's thought that the Treasury Department and Congress really don't have to address the debt ceiling problem until late spring or summertime. But this creates a really messy traffic jam ahead. It will be tough for lawmakers to approve new spending - and simultaneously vote to raise the debt ceiling. A vote to hike the debt limit is one of the most toxic roll call tallies a member of Congress can take. And if Congress doesn't increase the debt limit, the bond market and global exchanges could melt down.\n\nHow do they balance the books doing this? Good question.\n\n\"The same Republicans who howled 'fiscal responsibility' when it comes to investments to help working families are apparently willing to light billions of taxpayer dollars on fire and add to the federal deficit in order to build Trump's useless border wall,\" said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. \n\n\"The wall is a multi-billion dollar boondoggle in the making, and Republicans should be embarrassed about their brazen hypocrisy in enabling it.\"\n\nFor more than a decade now, Congress has struggled to just knife through the annual appropriations pie and pass all 12 individual slices to fund the government. Instead, lawmakers resort yearly to okaying an entire pie at once -- without full agreement on the individual pieces.\n\nYet congressional Republicans insist they'll approve that \"13th\" spending bill for the wall. A baker's dozen. Even if they again stumble doing the other pieces of the pie.\n\nIt wasn't very long ago that many Republicans opposed the wall. But things are different now.\n\nWhat changed?\n\n\"November 8th,\" Meadows said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.9822335243225098, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1350, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.24896670488, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170129020000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.77777777777778, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/05/bergdahls-former-platoon-leader-dismisses-pardon-plea.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [106, 487, 3549, 3558, 3591, 3598, 3626, 3677, 3706, 3737, 3744]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 558, "scraper_regex": 615}}, "headline": "Bergdahl's former platoon member dismisses pardon plea", "wordcount_as_scraped": 615, "date": "20161205180000", "story_content": "U.S. Army Sgt.

If granted by President Obama, it would allow Bergdahl to avoid a military trial scheduled for April where he faces charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The misbehavior charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.\n\nIf the pardon isn't granted, Bergdahl's defense team said it would expand its legal strategy to the new administration by filing a motion arguing that President-elect Donald Trump violated his due process rights with scathing public comments about the case.\n\nBergdahl, of Hailey, Idaho, walked off his post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was held captive by the Taliban and the group's allies for five years.\n\nThe Obama administration's decision in May 2014 to exchange him for five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, led some Republicans to accuse the president of jeopardizing the nation's safety. Some lawmakers said they were outraged the administration didn't give Congress a 30-day notice about transferring the detainees, as required by law.\n\nThroughout his presidential campaign, Trump was one of Bergdahl's most vocal critics, saying repeatedly the soldier was a traitor who would have been executed in the \"old days.\"\n\nDuring a July speech in Indiana, Trump lamented that Bergdahl could wind up with a light punishment.\n\n\"Remember the old days? A deserter, what happened?\" he said before pantomiming pulling a trigger and adding: \"Bang.\"\n\nBergdahl, who faces trial at Fort Bragg, has said he walked off his post in Afghanistan because he wanted to cause an alarm and draw attention to what he saw as problems with his unit.\n\nBut Bergdahl's lead defense lawyer, Eugene Fidell, said he planned to file a motion seeking dismissal of the charges against Bergdahl shortly after the January inauguration, arguing Trump violated Bergdahl's constitutional due-process rights.\n\nThe defense has been noting Trump's comments about Bergdahl in what they've dubbed the \"Trump Defamation Log.\" A version included in the court record lists 40 such instances as of August.\n\n\"All of these things put together and repeated rally upon rally for basically a year have a cumulative effect that I think is totally at odds with the right to a fair trial,\" Fidell said in a phone interview.\n\nSgt. Vierkant, Bergdahl's former platoon member, views the situation differently, thinking Bergdahl would receive a fair trial under the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\"He was never in his chain of\u00a0command.\u00a0He has no say or ruling over the\u00a0trial.\u00a0I believe we should let the\u00a0military be professionals\u2026 in the end, his opinion\u00a0isn't going to affect it any\u00a0more than my opinion or anyone\u00a0else.\"\u00a0\n\nFox News' Jennifer Griffin, Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.67823362350464, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 558, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.56163687338, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.3763440860215095, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/01/07/hack-proof-your-life-5-key-steps-to-boost-your-safety-online.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [2488], "\u00a0": [438, 5994]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 860, "scraper_regex": 1002}}, "headline": "Hack-proof your life: 5 key steps to boost your safety online", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1002, "date": "20170107140000", "story_content": "At this moment, someone wants your information. Hackers covet your email account, your home address, and your social security number. They want to commandeer your webcam and break into your bank account. They are just waiting for you to slip up and give them a chance.\n\nMalevolent coders are finding backdoors and vulnerabilities, but there are simple ways to protect yourself.\u00a0\n\nFollow these five steps to boost your safety online instantly.\n\n1. Passwords\n\nI've heard it a million times: \"I know that I shouldn't use the same password at every site, but I do.\" or \"Every time I set a new password, I forget it.\"\n\nWell, get over it. Relying on a weak password is asking to be hacked. Your passwords are either your first line of defense against hackers, or they're an open window that lets them slip through. In cyber-security, there is no middle ground.\n\nHow dangerous is it? A lowercase, six-character password takes a hacker around 10 minutes to hack. Add four more characters, and you extend the time of that heist by 45,000 years.\n\nReady to give your passwords the strength of Fort Knox? Here's a quick to-do:\n\nCreate a unique and complex password that isn't hard to remember. One trick is a \"passphrase,\" which is both a statement and a complex series of characters, cases, and numbers. Make a phrase that's specific to you like, \"MySonWasBornOnAug12!\"\n\nChange your password regularly, but not too often. I recommend that you change your password at least once every 12-month period. If one of the services you use is involved in a data breach, you'll want to update your password for that account.\n\nI wrote an entire tip about tools and tricks to remember hard-to-guess passwords. Click here for the best solutions to remember difficult passwords.\n\n2. Set up two-factor identification\n\nYou've probably seen this before, even if you didn't know what it was called. Two-factor identification is a fancy name for adding another step to the login process. A login page may ask for your first car or your favorite food. The website might even send a text message with a special code, to make sure you are who you claim to be.\n\nTwo-factor identification adds an important layer of protection to your account. For hackers, the coup de grace is setting up instant alerts when your account is accessed from an unfamiliar device or location. Usually, this is you because you're logging into your email account from an internet caf\u00e9 in London, or you're checking your bank balance on a trusted friend's phone.\n\nOther times, it's a hacker who is trying to figure out your credentials. You will receive a notification by email or text saying that there was a login from an unrecognized machine or someone asked to reset your password. The login will not be authorized or the password reset without having the special code included in the email or text.\n\nIf you do nothing else on this list, click here for the steps to turn on two-factor authentication on Google, Facebook and other sites you use.\n\n3. Delete accounts you've abandoned\n\nYou've probably encountered this before. Some spammy message shows up in your inbox, allegedly send from your beloved Aunt Joan. Why does Aunt Joan want you to click on this strange-looking link? Why is she suddenly interested in giving you a limited-time discount on a Rolex watch? These messages are sure signs of a hacked account.\n\nThe rule of thumb is this: Old accounts contain more personal data than you realize, no matter how short-lived and no matter how long it's been abandoned.\n\nHave too many online accounts to remember them all? Click here for a site that provides you with the steps you need to close down the accounts you're no longer using.\n\nSometimes, you may want to delete accounts simply because you've lost trust in the company that's storing your private information. After Yahoo's cover up of multiple data breaches, I recommend that you close your Yahoo account for Yahoo Mail and other related services such as Flickr, Tumblr, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Messenger, Yahoo Shopping, Yahoo Music, etc. Click here for a step-by-step guide for the steps you need to take right now if you're a Yahoo customer.\n\n4. Check if your info has been stolen\n\nNow you're on a mission to boost your security. But what about data that's already been stolen? How do you find out whether an account has already been broken into?\n\nAt least one trusted site is dedicated to precisely that: HaveIBeenPwned sifts through your accounts in search of security breaches. Just run your email address and username through the search field, and it will tell you if your login information has been linked to any past breaches.\n\n5. Encrypt all of your messages\n\n\"Encryption\" used to be a word reserved for international super-spies but not anymore. What you're looking for is \"end-to-end encryption.\" This method scrambles your messages so that they can't be read if someone other than the intended recipient gets it.\n\nSignal Private Messenger One encrypts all messages end-to-end by default. The service also doesn't keep any user information, such as address books or messages, on its servers. It lets you use your existing phone number and contacts list. For a full list of Signal features and download instructions, click here.\n\nRemember, your chain of online security is only as strong as its weakest hyperlink.\n\nWant to know other ways can you stay safe in the era of cyber-crime?

Roof looked down silently as the panel announced its decision in U.S. District Court in Charleston, S.C. late Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAfter the jury left the courtroom, Roof asked Judge Richard Gergel for new lawyers. Gergel told Roof he could make that argument at his formal sentencing hearing Wednesday morning.\n\nInsisting on representing himself in the sentencing phase of his trial, Roof's court-appointed defense team, which included renowned lawyer and capital punishment opponent David Bruck, was largely sidelined.\n\n\"We want to express our sympathy to all of the families who were so grievously hurt by Dylann Roof's actions,\" Roof's defense said in a statement. \"Today's sentencing decision means that this case will not be over for a very long time. We are sorry that, despite our best efforts, the legal proceedings have shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy.\"\n\nRoof's family said in a statement they will \"continue to pray for the Emanuel AME families and the Charleston community.\"\u00a0\n\n\"We will struggle as long as we live to understand why he committed this horrible attack, which caused so much pain to so many good people,\" the statement read. \"We wish to express the grief we feel for the victims of his crimes, and our sympathy to the many families he has hurt.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Roof delivered his own closing argument, in which the white supremacist denied that he was filled with hatred.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be fair to say that the prosecution hates me because they're trying to give me the death penalty?\" Roof asked rhetorically. \"Anyone who hates anything, in their mind has a good reason for it. And sometimes that's because they've been misled and sometimes it isn't. But I would say that in this case the prosecution, along with anyone else who hates me, are the ones who have been misled.\"\n\nSUSPECTED COP-KILLER ON THE LOOSE WANTED TO BE ON 'AMERICA'S MOST WANTED'\n\nRoof concluded his closing argument after only five minutes.\n\n\"That's all,\" he said.\n\nThe brevity of Roof's statement stood in stark contrast to the prosecution's closing argument, which lasted for two hours.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson reminded jurors how the nine victims at\u00a0\"Mother Emanuel\" Church had welcomed Roof, a stranger who had shown up at their Wednesday evening Bible study.\n\nAIRPORT SHOOTING SUSPECT'S MOM PLEADS: 'DON'T EXECUTE MY SON'\n\n\"The defendant had come not to learn, not to receive the Word, but he came with a hateful heart and a Glock 45,\" Richardson said.\n\nRichardson mentioned all of the victims by name, describing their importance to the community and their families, and the terrible loss caused by their untimely deaths. He contrasted these \"particularly good people\" with the horrific nature of Roof's crimes, his racist views and \"his belief in Hitler as a saint, as an icon, as someone to be emulated.\"\n\nThe prosecution showed the jury photos of Roof with his now familiar blank stare, pointing a pistol at the camera during target practice.\n\n\"He also chose to videotape himself doing it so that he could see the very last images that these victims would see,\" Richardson said. \"He wanted to see what he would look like as he stood over them.\"\n\nInside the courtroom, Roof looked straight forward, displaying no obvious emotion as the prosecution showed the jury graphic photos of the deceased victims' bodies lying on the bloodstained floor of their church meeting room.\n\nRichardson then went on to cite Roof's apparent lack of remorse for the crimes.\n\nHe quoted from a journal removed from the defendant's jail cell back in August of 2015 in which Roof writes, \"I do not regret what I did. I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed.\"\n\nThe prosecutor reminded jurors that even during this trial, Roof had entered the courtroom wearing hand drawn racist symbols on his shoes.\n\n\"Unrepentant, no remorse,\" Richardson added.\n\nAt the conclusion of his closing argument, Richardson urged jurors, \"Sentence this defendant to death for killing Clementa Pinckney.\"\n\nHe repeated the phrase eight more times to add the names of each victim.\n\nThe same panel of three black jurors and nine whites that convicted Roof back in December once again sided with the prosecution, unanimously calling for the ultimate punishment.\n\nFox News' Chip Bell and Multimedia Reporter Terace Garnier contributed to this report from Charleston.\n\n\n\nJonathan Serrie joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in April 1999 and currently serves as a correspondent based in the Atlanta bureau.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.66467046737671, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 719, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.86308195745, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 5, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.64255910987483, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/20/drug-lord-el-chapo-guzman-arrives-in-new-york-to-face-charges.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [74]}}, "headline": "Drug lord 'El Chapo' Guzman arrives in New York to face charges", "wordcount_as_scraped": 695, "date": "20170120050000", "story_content": "NEW YORK \u2013 \u00a0Infamous Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who twice escaped from maximum-security prisons in his country, was extradited at the request of the United States to face drug trafficking and other charges and arrived in New York late Thursday.\n\nTIMING OF EXTRADITION SEEN AS POLITICAL\n\nA plane carrying Guzman landed at a suburban airport, where a caravan of SUVs waited to take him away. Guzman, the convicted leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel, one of the world's largest drug trafficking organizations, was expected to spend the night in a New York jail before his first appearance in a federal courthouse in Brooklyn on Friday, officials said.\n\nMexico's Department of Foreign Relations announced Guzman was handed over to U.S. authorities for transportation to the U.S. earlier Thursday, the last full day of Democratic President Barack Obama's administration and a day before Republican Donald Trump's scheduled inauguration.\n\nNOTABLE DATES IN MEXICO'S DECADE-OLD DRUG WAR\n\nGuzman was taken into custody by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Ciudad Juarez, a border town across from El Paso, Texas.\n\nGuzman, who's in his late 50s, first escaped from prison in 2001 and then spent more than a decade on the run before he was recaptured, only to escape again in 2015 via a mile-long tunnel dug to the shower in his cell.\n\nThe 2015 escape was highly embarrassing for the government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, and Mexican officials were seen as eager to hand the headache off to the United States afterward. A court denied Guzman's appeal and found his extradition was constitutional, the Mexican Department of Foreign Relations said.\n\nIn Mexico, Deputy Attorney General Alberto Elias Beltran told reporters late Thursday that Guzman still faces formal charges in 10 other cases.\n\n\"When he completes his sentence in ... the United States, he will return to Mexico to continue\" the prosecutions, he said.\n\nGuzman's lawyers had fought extradition since his 2016 recapture and said Thursday the Mexican government sent him to the United States to distract the public from nationwide protests over gasoline prices.\n\n\"It was illegal. They didn't even notify us,\" lawyer Andres Granados said. \"They handled it politically to obscure the situation of the gas price hike. It's totally political.\"\n\nBesides New York, Guzman faces charges in five other U.S. jurisdictions, including San Diego, Chicago and Miami. He could face the possibility of life in a U.S. prison if convicted.\n\nAn indictment in New York accuses him of running a massive drug operation that employed thousands of people, laundered billions of dollars in profits back to Mexico and used hit men to carry out murders, kidnappings and acts of torture.\n\nAfter his recent escape, he became something of a folk legend for a segment of Mexico's population for his defiance of authorities. He was immortalized in songs known as narco-corridos, ballads about the drug trade and drug bosses.\n\nIt was while on the lam the second time, in fall 2015, that he held a secret meeting with actors Sean Penn and Kate del Castillo. The encounter was the subject of a lengthy article Penn published in Rolling Stone last January, right after Mexican marines re-arrested Guzman in the western state of Sinaloa.\n\nIn the interview, Guzman was unapologetic about his criminal activities, saying he had turned to drug trafficking at age 15 simply to survive.\n\n\"The only way to have money to buy food, to survive, is to grow poppy, marijuana, and at that age, I began to grow it, to cultivate it and to sell it. That is what I can tell you,\" he was quoted as saying in Penn's article.\n\nThe decision by Mexico to extradite one of its most prized prisoners to the U.S. comes as Trump has taken a tough stand on illegal immigration from that country, vowing to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. Mexican officials have repeatedly said they will not pay for a wall.\n\nDerek Maltz, who headed the DEA's Special Operations Division until his retirement in mid-2014, said the timing of Guzman's extradition less than 24 hours ahead of Trump's inauguration could be seen as a show of good faith by Mexico.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.77489757537842, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 673, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.8862741575300004, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170120050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.97176820208024, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/26/secret-meaning-donald-trumps-incredible-first-100-hours.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [5422, 5535, 5576]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 811, "scraper_regex": 860}}, "headline": "The secret meaning of Donald Trump's revolutionary first 100 hours ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 860, "date": "20170126200000", "story_content": "Donald Trump walked into the Oval Office on the first Monday of his presidency less than 100 hours ago, and what has ensued is a frenzy of focused activity aimed at national and job security.\n\nThrough a series of executive actions, the president has been checking off his campaign promises like a Friday to-do list before a three-day weekend. \n\nAuthorize building the wall, check. Streamline federal regulations on building pipelines, check. Order a regulatory streamlining plan from the Commerce Department to ease burdens on manufacturers increasing the number of jobs, check. Implement \"extreme vetting\" of asylum seekers from certain Middle Eastern countries, check. Withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, check. Clear away bureaucratic debris to allow the building of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, check.\n\nIn his first 100 hours, Trump has shown that the previous administration's choice to create law using the president's pen and phone can and will be eviscerated one signature at a time.\n\nBut what is most significant is the political deftness Trump and his team are showing. The picture of the new president sitting with some of his most ardent opponents from organized labor has got to send shivers down the spines of Democratic Party insiders.\n\nOpen Secrets reports that private sector unions contributed more than $25 million in political donations in 2016, with an overwhelming majority going to Democrats. But the real political power of labor unions within the Democratic Party is their established political network, which provides instant trained grassroots to benefit candidates they support.\n\nTrump's White House invitation and meeting threaten to rip asunder the out-of-power Democrat establishment's precariously balanced coalition of environmental anti-economic-growth elitists and labor union-identifying blue-collar workers. \n\nTo date, the top-down rule of labor organizations has assured the Democratic Party the benefits of the money and muscle that these groups can provide, while increasingly losing their voters' support.\n\nIn the first 100 hours of the Trump administration, Democratic Party hegemony through that top-down rule has been shaken, as many of the leaders who visited the White House received access they never had to Barack Obama, who was pivoting toward a loose coalition of millennials, Silicon Valley elites and identity politics-based voters, and away from the blue-collar voters who had been a mainstay of decades of electoral success.\n\nThe meeting with the labor leaders preceded Trump's signature on a memorandum withdrawing the United States' signature from the crown jewel of Obama's trade policy, the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 giving the union leaders a big win. Less than two hours later, Trump was signing another memorandum undoing the Democrat policy of administratively killing the job-creating Keystone XL pipeline, a high priority of many of the union leaders who were in the Oval Office.\n\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters General President James Hoffa Jr. applauded President Trump, crowing in victory: \"This is a major step toward putting more Americans to work, building the infrastructure that we need and creating economic prosperity.\"\n\nIn his book, \"The Art of the Deal,\"Trump listed his No. 1 attribute for success: \"I like thinking big. I always have. To me it's very simple: if you're going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.\"\n\nIn the first five days of his presidency, Trump has thought big, setting in motion a chain of events that could alter the electoral map for a generation. In an adroit political act, albeit one I disagree with, Trump signed a separate pipeline memorandum requiring that American steel be used in building the pipelines.\n\nThrough this bold move, he signaled to everyone that he is a different kind of president. Unbound by conventional philosophical constraints, he has unleashed projects that supporters of limited government and a free market believe are necessary to achieve North American energy independence and the economic benefits that entails, while putting a decidedly anti-free-market pill in the package to force-feed private-sector money into taking a small step in rebuilding the American steel and coal industries.\n\nAnyone surprised by this approach should remember another of Trump's principles from his book: \"Deals work best when each side gets something it wants from the other.\"\n\nIn the first 100 hours, we have seen this at work, as \"populist\" Trump and \"cut regulations\" Trump have come together, forcing everyone to think in a new way, beyond the set piece arguments that have calcified American politics.\n\nJust as Candidate Trump dismantled conventional wisdom by ripping through the Democrats' vaunted Blue Wall of Rust Belt states, President Trump seems intent on moving forward with policies he perceives will help rebuild our nation's manufacturing base. However, unlike those Republicans in the 1950s who declared that whatever was good for General Motors was good for America, Trump's cry seems to be, whatever is good for the American worker who makes, builds and extracts wealth, is good for the country and the world.\n\nIn the first 100 hours of Trump, everything has changed. Rather than him adapting to D.C., it appears D.C. will be forced to adapt to him. The swamp is in trouble.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRichard Manning is president of Americans for Limited Government.

Trump \"really scares\" her with his comments about Latinos and other groups and his treatment of women.\n\n\"It seems like he just takes what people are afraid of and makes them even more scared of it,\" said Evan, a white seventh-grader in Fayetteville, Georgia.\n\nWhen 12-year-old Habib Rahman's mother burst into tears while driving him to school the day after the election, he put his hand on her shoulder and recited a passage from the Quran about ease following hardship.\n\n\"I'd barely seen my mom cry. And when I do, I feel like I should try and help her as quickly as possible,\" said Habib, a seventh-grader from suburban Dallas who would've liked to see Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders go farther in the race.\n\nAs the family watched the election results, his mother, Melissa Walker, grew concerned that they could become targets, thinking of comments Trump had made about Muslims, which included proposing a ban on foreign Muslims entering the U.S. She said she doesn't think Trump would speak out against violence toward Muslims.\n\n\"It's upsetting,\" Habib said, \"because most people coming to the country are trying to find a safer place.\"\n\nTrump also promised during his campaign to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals here and advocated mass deportations. He's tried to walk back some of the harshest comments.\n\nOsiris Ramirez said he wasn't happy that Trump won \"because of what he said about Mexicans and all that.\" The 10-year-old Phoenix boy's parents are Mexican immigrants who recently became U.S. citizens, and he's worried that Trump will not treat immigrants fairly.\n\nEthan Hedden, a seventh-grader in Fayetteville, Georgia, said he favored Trump in the election. The 13-year-old called much of the reaction over Trump's comments \"a little bit overdramatic\" but said he could also see where other people were coming from.\n\nThe election was the topic of many conversations at school, he said, but he found other students were unwilling to discuss anything negative about Clinton, who faced persistent questions about her honesty and trustworthiness. He thought many classmates were more anti-Trump than pro-Clinton. Among the things he didn't like about Clinton were her ideas on tightening restrictions on guns.\n\n\"Mostly, I just kept quiet and listened to them,\" said Ethan, whose mother is Native American and father is of Italian descent.\n\nNine-year-old Gracyn Marquez was fine with either candidate winning. \"I kind of wanted Donald Trump to win because he's a really good businessman, but I also wanted Hillary to win because she's a strong woman,\" the Dallas-area third-grader said.\n\nHer Hispanic father, Mateo Marquez, who teaches kids mindfulness through yoga, said he asked those in a preschool class on Election Day what they would do if they were president. He said their answers were \"simple but very powerful\" and included being nice to people and giving homes to the homeless.\n\nLamisa Mustafa, 17-year-old Dallas-area high school senior who is Muslim, said she was sad and scared that Americans had elected Trump. She said his talk of a ban on Muslims goes against American values and religious freedom.\n\nBut as the week went on, she took heart from Clinton's concession speech and is looking forward. She worries that protests over Trump might hurt the goal of unity.\n\n\"We need to keep fighting for what we believe in \u2014 make sure that none of our rights are threatened,\" she said. \"But we can do that with peaceful conversations with people.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Deepti Hajela in New York City and Astrid Galvan in Phoenix contributed.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.8679950237274199, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 715, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.73332661425, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161111220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 4.1958041958042, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/06/trump-has-constructive-briefing-on-russia-hacking-says-no-effect-on-election.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [784, 1911, 2088, 2508, 2733, 2892, 3443, 3785, 4444, 6289]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 672, "scraper_regex": 962}}, "headline": "Intel report says Putin ordered campaign to influence US election", "wordcount_as_scraped": 962, "date": "20170106210000", "story_content": "A declassified U.S. intelligence report released Friday directly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering a campaign to influence the U.S. election and hurt Hillary Clinton's candidacy \u2013 findings made public after officials briefed President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe report said:\n\n\"We assess with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\"\u00a0\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE REPORT\n\nThe intelligence report said this campaign included cyber activity and other efforts.\n\nThe report adds fresh fuel to the debate over Russia's involvement in email hacking that affected Democratic groups during the 2016 race. Trump has publicly questioned the evidence linking Russia and, hours before his briefing on Friday, called the focus a \"political witch hunt.\"\n\nHowever, Trump and the intelligence community seemed to find some common ground after the briefing. Both Trump and the report said the Russians did not target vote tallying.\n\nTrump, in a statement, went a step further and said \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\"\n\nThe report did not make an assessment on the impact on the election outcome.\n\nWhile some have used the claims of Russian meddling to question the validity of Trump's victory \u2013 including in a failed protest on the House floor during the certification of the Electoral College tally Friday \u2013 House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement that \"Donald Trump\u00a0won this election fair and square.\"\n\nStill, the report lays out in new and alarming detail an alleged influence campaign stemming from Moscow, which Ryan and others condemned. \u00a0\n\nThe report said that included cyber activity, as well as efforts by state-funded media and paid social media \"trolls.\" The report said Russian intelligence services conducted cyber operations against both major U.S. parties, and said they have \"high confidence\" Russian military intelligence used Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks.com to release \"US victim data\" publicly and to the media, \"and relayed material to WikiLeaks.\"\u00a0\n\nWikiLeaks famously published emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta last year. Founder Julian Assange, however, told Fox News this past week that Russia was not his source.\u00a0\n\nThe intelligence report was declassified in the wake of Obama administration sanctions and other retaliation against the Russian government late last month.\u00a0The unclassified version included footnotes acknowledging that it \"does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign.\" But it said its conclusions were identical to the classified version.\n\nThe report said Russian intelligence got access to DNC networks in July 2015 and maintained that access until at least June 2016. Despite past suggestions from Clinton allies that some leaked emails might be inauthentic, the report also noted that, \"Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries.\"\u00a0\n\nThe report also said: \"Moscow's approach evolved over the course of the campaign based on Russia's understanding of the electoral prospects of the two main candidates. When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency.\"\u00a0\n\nIn a statement issued shortly before the release of the report, Trump stressed his regard for the intelligence community: \"I had a constructive meeting and conversation with the leaders of the Intelligence Community this afternoon. I have tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation.\"\n\nBut the allegations have been the subject of fierce debate in Washington, especially among Republicans.\n\nGOP lawmakers like Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have essentially accepted the accusations against Russia, while Trump and his allies have cast doubt on them or suggested they were meant to discredit him.\u00a0\n\nIn his written statement, Trump acknowledged that Russia, China and others \"are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee\" \u2013 but said \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome.\"\n\nTrump also said the U.S. needs to fight and stop cyberattacks, and he'll appoint a team to give him a plan within 90 days of taking office. \"Two weeks from today I will take the oath of office and America's safety and security will be my number one priority,\" he said.\n\nBefore the briefing, Trump continued to raise concerns about the intel being used for political purposes. He told The New York Times he doesn't want other countries hacking the U.S., but said the attention on Russia's alleged actions stems from those who \"got beaten very badly in the election\" and \"are very embarrassed.\"\n\nFollowing on complaints about how the intelligence findings have been portrayed in the media, he even tweeted that he's asked congressional committee leaders to \"investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.\"\n\nIn another twist, following reports that the FBI never accessed the Democratic National Committee's servers as part of their probe, a senior FBI official told Fox News the bureau did in fact ask \u2013 and was denied.\n\n\"The FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated,\" the official said. \"This left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier.\"\n\nFox News' Catherine Herridge and Matthew Dean and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.34159779548645, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 672, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.7372372347400002, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170106210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.97619047619048, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/11/tornado-hits-california-as-flood-dangers-surge.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2557]}}, "headline": "Tornado hits California as flood dangers surge", "wordcount_as_scraped": 732, "date": "20170111200000", "story_content": "A small tornado tore tree limbs and ripped awnings as a powerful band of thunderstorms moved through Northern California during the latest deluge to swell rivers and prompt evacuations over flood fears.\n\nCAUGHT ON VIDEO: MOM, 3 KIDS RESCUED AFTER MINIVAN PLUNGES DOWN STEEP EMBANKMENT\n\nThe tornado was on the ground for about 3/8 of a mile just south of Sacramento late Tuesday, National Weather Service meteorologist David Rowe said.\n\nNo injuries were reported from the twister, which was about 100 yards wide and registered on the low end of the tornado scale.\n\nThe twister got the attention of forecasters at the weather service's Sacramento office.\n\nHISTORIC HOLLOWED-OUT SEQUOIA TREE IN CALIFORNIA TOPPLES DURING STORM\n\n\"It came as a little bit of a surprise considered that we're so focused on all the heavy snow and rain,\" Rowe said, adding that the Sacramento area received about 2 inches of rain Tuesday.\n\nMeteorologists in the Northwest received their own storm surprise. A major snowstorm spread through Portland, Oregon, and southwest Washington, toppling trees, closing schools, cutting power to thousands. Parts of Portland got more than a foot of snow, a rare event in a city known for its rain.\n\nThe intensity of the storm came as a surprise to meteorologists, most of whom expected no more than 4 inches.\n\n\"We are going to be analyzing this one, because this is a special one,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Treena Jensen said.\n\nWhile the heaviest downpours have moved through Northern California, and rivers are expected to recede throughout the day, the risk of flooding remains from runoff and showers predicted to continue into Thursday.\n\nAbout 2,000 people in Wilton, a rural community near Sacramento, were asked to leave their homes Tuesday evening, as emergency crews worked to try to bolster a Cosumnes River levee.\n\nSacramento County emergency services official Mary Jo Flynn said officials were monitoring in case water spills over the levee. Low-lying buildings are at risk of inundation but Flynn pointed out many of the homes along the path of a possible flood are built on berms or sit on higher ground.\n\nAn evacuation center opened in neighboring Elk Grove but some residents said they plan to stay put.\n\n\"We have no concerns,\" Lill Nichols, who with her husband runs a horse farm near the river, told the Sacramento Bee. \"We have animals and can't evacuate anyway.\"\n\nA blizzard warning remains in effect at Lake Tahoe, with a half-foot of snow forecast for Wednesday. \u00a0Unexpected rain has prompted more flooding in parts of northern Nevada, including Reno, Sparks and Carson City.\n\nSeveral ski resorts in parts of the Sierra planned to stay shuttered for a second day Wednesday, including Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows, which has no power due to the storm. The resort posted on Facebook on Wednesday that it had received more than 3 feet of snow in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe Russian River in California rose again under pounding rain, placing some 3,000 Sonoma County residents under an evacuation advisory. Officials red-tagged seven homes, ordering residents out, when a rain-soaked embankment came crashing down.\n\nJohna Peterson was one of few residents who ventured out Tuesday in the remote Sonoma County town of Monte Rio. Walking on the bridge across the Russian River, Peterson worried about what the coming hours and days would bring.\n\n\"I think it's going to go higher,\" Peterson said. \"There's nowhere for this water to go.\"\n\nPeople were evacuated in downtown San Anselmo, north of San Francisco, after a rain-swollen creek broke its banks. The Corte Madera Creek was flowing 1 foot over flood stage, the Marin County Sheriff's Office said.\n\nIn Southern California the second fast-moving storm this week dumped steady rain. Officials warned residents along Los Angeles-area hillsides scarred by wildfires of the possibility of mudslides, but only minor debris flows were reported.\n\nThe storms were the latest of back-to-back systems that have brought the heaviest rain in a decade to parts of Northern California and Nevada.\n\nA series of storms already has added 33 billion gallons of water to Lake Tahoe since Jan. 1.\n\nThe storms are part of an \"atmospheric river\" weather phenomenon that draws precipitation from the Pacific Ocean as far west as Hawaii.\n\nIn Colorado, several passes are closed so crews can trigger slides Wednesday to make them safe as more snow falls in the mountains.

There were aging Holocaust survivors crossing one last time the gates of hell that was Auschwitz. There was the parade in Moscow which saluted the last of a generation that defeated the Nazis and stormed Hitler's Berlin bunker.\n\nThere was the momentous visit by President Obama to ground zero at Hiroshima, a gesture deeply appreciated by Japan, now the strongest democracy in Asia and our key ally in region.\n\nOn this December 7th, remaining survivors of that \"day of infamy,\" recalled the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, a pivotal event that roused America from its isolationist stupor to take on the Axis Powers.\n\nAnd now, Japanese Prime Minister Abe will visit Pearl Harbor, but Japanese officials hastened to add that he will not offer an apology.\n\nThat's a shame. While such a gesture would enrage many of Abe's core constituency, it would have helped many people who suffered the consequences of Imperial Japan's launching the Asia-Pacific war, find closure for the past and hope for the future.\n\nChief among those who deserve the bow and apology are former American servicemen and women who witnessed the deaths of their comrades in Pearl Harbor and on forgotten beaches that dot the Pacific, along with the handful of former American POWs and slave laborers still alive today.\n\nAnd Yoshiko Shimabukoru and her classmates also deserve an apology.\n\nI met 88-year-old Yoshiko at the opening of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Courage to Remember exhibition in Okinawa. She guided me through the Himeyuri Peace Museum located near the site of one of the most vicious and deadly battles of WWII.\n\nYoshiko is not an ordinary guide. She is a survivor and eyewitness to an all- but- forgotten chapter of history. With great dignity and piercing honesty, Yoshiko described how she and her teenage Okinawan classmates were pressed into service as nurses by the Japanese Imperial Army. Soldiers were under orders to fight against US forces to the last man\u2014and civilian. When it finally ended, more than 12,000 American troops had been killed\u2014the largest single US casualty count in the Pacific Theater and over 70,000 Japanese soldiers died.\n\n142,000 Okinawan civilians perished.\n\nThe Japanese military was determined to slow America's march towards the home islands, whatever the human toll. Ironically, it was their scorched earth policy, the fanaticism of their soldiers, the use of civilians as human shields, and the resulting massive US casualties that in the end, actually hastened the defeat of Japan.\n\nOkinawa proved to American leaders that a head-on invasion of Japan proper would be disastrous. Japanese soldiers and civilians, including women and children could be expected to defend their homeland such fanaticism that it was projected that an invasion could cost 1 million Americans killed and wounded.\n\nWithout question, Okinawa influenced President Truman's decision not to put American boots on Japanese soil, but instead drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nBut back then, teenage Yoshiko and her classmates knew nothing about the geo-politics, only that they were trapped in a war that they were taught Japan would never lose.\n\nAt the Peace Museum I walked with Yoshiko amidst smiling pictures, that in peacetime would have been in her high school yearbook, but here served to put a human face on friends who never had a chance.\n\nYoshiko paused at many a photograph, recalling the circumstances of each life cut short. She also stopped at two tablets that had no pictures\u2014only names. It was as if she wanted to ensure that these faceless victims of war would still be remembered, if only for another day\u2026\n\nBefore leaving that day, I asked, \"Yoshiko, it is 70 years later, what is the most important lesson that you have learned?\"\n\nWithout hesitation she sighed: \"We knew nothing about the outside world\u2026I look back now and realize they lied to us. Our education was a lie...\"\n\nBut many in Japan today still believe that Imperial Japan was the victim, not the initiator of war. From Okinawa to Hiroshima, the historic narrative always seems to begin with the very real suffering of innocent civilians, rarely with the surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, the Philippines and so many other unsuspecting Asian nations that December, 70 years ago.\n\nDoes memory of past man-made disasters really make a difference?\n\nIt does, if humankind wants to avoid repeating the past.\n\nIt is safe to assume that the Japanese Prime Minister won't apologize at Pearl Harbor. Pity. Pretty soon the world won't have any survivors to apologize to.\n\nBut we can still hope that today's leaders and younger generations will ponder echoes of the past etched in this poem at Okinawa's Peace Memorial:\n\nWe went on the battlefield without knowing the truth.\n\nWar kills everything --\n\nthe life of every single being\n\ntherefore our story continues\n\nWe will speak the truth of war, brutality, pain, engraved in our bodies and memories.\n\n\n\nRabbi Abraham Cooper is associate Dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.

It sounds simple and probably a little confusing at this point, but it may save your life.\n\nFar too often innocent civilians across America are hearing the terrifying sound of gunfire and/or explosions in places that they should not be hearing it. Who would have thought that a trip to the grocery store or a shopping mall would require forethought and planning for such events? Most people still don't think this way, but our collective level of alertness needs to be increasing.\n\nMILITARY VETERANS, FEDERAL AGENTS JOIN FORCES TO FIGHT CHILD PREDATORS\n\nMass shooter and lone wolf terror incidents are on a steady climb and there does not seem to be any end in sight for such terror. Extremist groups across the globe have begun to understand that frequent chaos can have more significant impact than the grandiose attacks of the past, which take more coordination. More coordination equals more communication, which means it becomes more likely that the U.S. and foreign intelligence services will be able to identify and disrupt the plans. However, as we have all witnessed, lone wolf terror attacks are far more difficult, almost impossible, to predict and we subsequently are frequently in reaction, vice prevention, mode. Particularly in cases where susceptible individuals in the United States, or elsewhere, are radicalized via the internet and have no previous ties to extremist groups.\n\nWith this type of activity on the rise we frequently are asked, 'What do I do if I find myself stuck in the middle of one of these events?' The question has been addressed by self-declared experts on multiple network television shows and print publications, but the hard truth with such a new phenomenon is that most are not trained to handle these individual and extremely unique terror incidents, particularly when it comes to interdiction. Given the nature of how these unique events start and often culminate rather quickly before first responders can even arrive on the scene, people \u2013 you \u2013 are typically on their own.\n\nMINNESOTA MAN GETS 15 YEARS IN ISLAMIC STATE CASE\n\nHow depressing, people are not specifically trained to handle this and won't get to us in time. Great, thanks OpsLens.\n\nDon't worry, it is not that bad, we will give you some tools that we are taught and can help you and your loved ones improve your odds of surviving and you will be shocked how simple our suggestion is. In fact, you have already repeated it to yourself\u2026\n\n'Get off the X\u2026'\n\nElements of training for most intelligence and military operators touch on evading and escaping similar horrific events, but it varies greatly depending on where one serves.\n\nWhat is common however throughout the services and intelligence agencies is the concept of getting off the 'X'. Even the most highly trained operators in the world know when it is time to retreat and fight another day, and that is what this concept touches on. While it can happen while performing an offensive action, whether patrolling or performing a direct action mission via ambush or a surprise resistance force, the need to get off the X most typically occurs when you least expect it. For your purposes, enter the increased number of lone-wolf terror attacks.\n\nPeople at a restaurant in Paris didn't expect a man to detonate himself while they sipped on a nice Bordeaux, nor did individuals expect to be gunned down at a holiday party in San Bernardino, but alas this is the world we live in now. Our list could of course go on and on with Orlando, New Jersey, Boston, the truck incident in Nice or the terror in Brussels, but you get the point. Danger is now always closer than it used to be and as such we need be prepared.\n\nSorry to reiterate a sour point, but most of you will not have the luxury like myself and my colleagues that have received a myriad of scenario based training where muscle memory is formed. So the next best thing is training your brain and visualizing events and how you would react, this will (for some of you) kick in when it counts.\n\nPeople will call you crazy for taking mental note of exits and possible threats when entering a room or building writ large, but you need to. Just don't tell them if you feel weird about it, but always be visually experiencing in your mind what could happen, because that will help you when the worst happens, particularly with getting off the X.\n\nSo what is the X?\n\nSimply stated the X is the location of increased danger and violence. It is the area where the greatest threat to your existence occurs. This can change as an event progresses, but using the Paris restaurant as an example, the X is the restaurant where the violence is occurring. If there is gunfire in the mall, the X is the section within the mall where the shooter is actively firing at civilians.\n\nThe reasoning for getting off the X is obvious; your chance of survival dramatically increases if you are not in the blast zone or range of fire from a shooter. But getting off the X is also not always as simple as it sounds. As mentioned before, most individuals are not trained to endure such horrifying events where the floor is ripped out from beneath you, we are. For most, such events will cause many to freeze in a heightened state of fear and/or shock, when they should be moving off the X. Again, nothing can replace training and repetition, but having at least visualized these events in your head helps.\n\nEven as you read this, some will be saying, but what exactly is the X, define the space, which we cannot because it varies on location, the threat, etc. The bottom line is people have to move quickly and smartly away from the threat, even if in increments.\u00a0 Bottom line: The goal is always to place more distance between you and the individual or individuals that are creating the violence.\n\nKeep in mind a few things as you consider your movement off the X and to your first safe space. Most shooters are not trained sharpshooters, meaning their manipulation of the weapon, or weapons, that they are using is not perfected and as such their accuracy is going to suffer. But this alone isn't a comforting thought for running away from the danger, so consider other elements.\n\nWhat pieces of cover are between you and freedom?\n\nCover is anything that can protect you from the shooter. This is not just line of sight though, standing behind a traditional wooden or drywall is not cover because as you might imagine those structures are quite permeable and will not protect you from gunfire.\u00a0 A concrete wall, barrier or pillar will do, or if in parking garage the engine block or wheel well of vehicles. Translation, if you can avoid it, don't just sprint down a straight hallway when fleeing the shooter. Bound from one piece of cover to another and always know that the X may be following you. Remember keep getting distance until you are certain that you are safe.\n\nPay attention to the shooter(s) cadence of fire.\n\nI know, I know most do not know what weapons fire what amount of rounds. We get that, but use some basic logic here. In the movies good and bad guys alike just keep shooting, but if there is any silver lining in these horrific real life events, know that the bad guy will have to reload. Listen for lulls in fire or if you have visual of the assaulter, then try to observe for those brief seconds when he or she is reloading, that could be your chance to run.\n\nIn conclusion, these events are never pretty. They are never the same. But the simplest solution to take with you and your loved ones is to 'get off the X', run, get away from the threat. Staying and hoping for the best is never the smart solution. Remember, even in these terrifying and unpredictable scenarios, the best trained warriors will employ the same strategy and try live to fight another day.\n\nDrew Berquist is the founder and a Senior Contributor for OpsLens.

Assad became anathema in the West and much of the region after the brutal means he employed during six years of carnage that killed hundreds of thousands, displaced half his population and sent millions of refugees to neighboring countries and Europe.\n\nBut much has changed. Vladimir Putin's Russia is fully engaged on Assad's side, with no world players eager to take it on. The assortment of rebel groups now clings to a handful of pockets around the country, lacking momentum and likely to return to a low-grade insurgency at best.\n\nMost critically, the incoming U.S. president projects a sort of flexibility lacking under Barack Obama. Promising to scale up the war on the Islamic State group, Donald Trump has hinted he would be ready to work with Assad and Russia. \"I don't like Assad at all,\" Trump said during the second presidential debate in October. \"But Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS,\" he said, using an alternative acronym for the group. And his selection of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who has extensive business dealings with Russia and ties to Putin, has only fueled speculation that Trump would pursue closer ties with Moscow.\n\nIf such a shift occurs, it would resolve an awkwardness that has bedeviled the two-year, U.S.-led military effort to uproot IS militants from the swaths of Iraq and Syria they seized in 2014. In these areas, the group established an extraordinarily ruthless \"caliphate\" with mass killings and enslavement, imposed their brutal interpretation of Islam and fomented regional insurgencies and global terrorism.\n\nThat helped pull together a broad coalition of Western and Middle Eastern nations that seems near victory in Iraq, where the Baghdad government has been a critical ally leading the fight on the ground and where a major battle for the key city of Mosul is now underway.\n\nBut in Syria, the fight was complicated by Assad's pariah status. Lacking a local military ally, the U.S.-led coalition has partnered with irregulars and relied on air power and some special forces' operations. That approach, which has had modest success, may well erode if Assad is widely deemed to have survived the war.\n\nAleppo is key to cementing that perception \u2014 its loss is a crushing blow to the rebels, leaving them little chance of recovering momentum. Syria's largest city was once the country's commercial powerhouse, holding symbolic and strategic importance as an ancient trading post and longtime gateway to Turkey and the West. Assad also controls the capital, Damascus, the major cities of Homs and Hama, as well as most of the Lebanese border and the Mediterranean coast, where his minority Alawite sect holds sway.\n\nAssad has vowed to carry on with the war until all of Syria is retaken, but has expressed confidence that opposition to him is on the decline. \"Even if we finish in Aleppo, we will carry on with the war against them,\" he told a local newspaper last week.\n\nNow he can free up some of his troops and thousands of allied militiamen to turn to remaining pockets held by rebels elsewhere in Syria, as well as the Islamic State jihadis. These rebel areas include some stretches around Damascus and near the Jordanian border, as well as in northern Idlib province, a stronghold of Syria's al-Qaida affiliate.\n\n\"The recapture of Aleppo will position Assad to claim that he is Syria's legitimate sovereign ruler and lobby the international community to provide him with support,\" said Jennifer Cafarella of the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.\n\nHe seems more likely to achieve that if he is actively engaged in fighting the Islamic State group, which has not been a top priority despite the fact that its major stronghold is the mid-sized Syrian city of Raqqa. On Sunday, IS extremists re-occupied the central town of Palmyra, which they had been expelled from earlier this year \u2014 a surprise attack that clearly took advantage of the Russian and Syrian government's preoccupation with Aleppo.\n\nIt's unclear whether Assad will prioritize retaking Palmyra, with what's left of its archaeological treasures after the first Islamic State occupation. He may prefer to wait a few months in hopes of engineering a new situation with the new team in Washington.\n\nEither way, Syria's future will likely be messy for a while, given the array of armed factions, the likelihood of continued foreign meddling through porous borders and the trauma and rage felt by much of the population. Many expect a continued insurgency \u2014 which in turn would help Assad argue that he should be viewed as a partner in the international fight against \"terrorism.\"\n\nIn the battle for local hearts and minds, it looms large that Assad relied so heavily not only on Russia and longtime ally Iran to retake Aleppo, but was also aided by Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah militia and volunteers from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThis stands in stark contrast to the outside powers supporting the opposition. No one sent in troops other than Turkey, an intervention mostly bent on downsizing Kurdish fighters it deemed a threat to its own security. The Syrian rebels were armed only lightly, and the United States refrained from attacking Assad even after the 2013 use of chemical weapons. Even the notion of a no-fly zone over northern Syria was rejected.\n\nCafarella said this environment legitimizes an emerging al-Qaida narrative that the international community allowed Iran and Russia to dominate Syria, and as a puppet Assad must be opposed.\n\n\"Al-Qaida's ability to recruit will grow rather than diminish after Aleppo's fall,\" she said. \"The terror threat emanating from Syria will increase rather than decrease.\"\n\nA big question now is the position of Assad's regional enemies, from Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations to Turkey. Assad may lobby for restarting peace talks, betting on the opposition's weakness to force concessions \u2014 chiefly that he should remain in power at the head of a more inclusive government. But given the epic devastation he has overseen, a genuine rapprochement seems unlikely in the extreme.\n\n___\n\nZeina Karam is the AP's news director for Lebanon and Syria and has covered Syria since 1997.

No one was hurt, but the incident sent customers running. Welch, who told authorities he went to the establishment to \"self-investigate\" the sex ring claims, allegedly was spotted looking for rumored tunnels filled with hidden children, a nearby store owner told The Washington Post.\n\nMAN WITH RIFLE ARRESTED AT DC EATERY\n\nWelch apparently was searching for proof of the so-called \"#pizzagate\" plot, initially advanced by users on 4Chan and Reddit on Nov. 4, citing seemingly innocuous details from Podesta's hacked emails as evidence of a child sex operation.\n\nThe author of one popular blog that gathered many of the details pointed, for instance, to the 2014 email to\u00a0Podesta about a supposedly missing handkerchief. The blog claimed the description of the cloth\u00a0as \"white w/ black\" correlated to a \"handkerchief code\" indicating leanings toward \"S&M\" and \"Virginity/Pedo.\"\n\nThe handkerchief was described in the email as \"having a map that seems pizza-related.\" Podesta referred often in his emails to pizza \u2013 a popular dish for anybody, never mind hungry and overworked campaign staffers. But the numerous mentions merited a deeper look for some. And that brought them to the pizzeria that Welch walked into on Sunday: Comet Ping Pong.\n\nComet Ping Pong has been a popular eatery for a decade. Its walls are painted with trendy murals and its owner, James Alefantis, was ranked No. 49 in GQ's 2012 edition of the 50 most powerful people in Washington.\n\nBut to posters on 4Chan and Reddit, the murals contained disguised symbols of pedophilia. It was even posited that Comet Ping Pong's logo had Satanic connections. Alefantis' personal social media postings, which contained popular memes and pictures of family and friends, were dissected for alleged links to the sex scheme. This included an Instagram image of a girl with her arms stuck with masking tape to a table, with a comment joking about it being a \"procedure for your youngest guests.\" His fundraising links to key Democratic figures \u2013 including Podesta \u2013 were also cited as proof.\n\nAlefantis was a sender or recipient of about 20 of the more than 50,000 leaked Podesta emails, with messages dating between 2008 and 2016. In one October 2008 email, Alefantis wrote to Podesta following a fundraiser: \"Raised over 40 grand. My only regret is I did not make you a nice pizza. When can I?\"\n\nThe conspiracy theorists claim \"pizza\" is a euphemism.\u00a0\n\nAs far-fetched as \"#pizzagate\" is, Bill Clinton's past helped fuel the theorists. The former president \u2013\u00a0aside from having acknowledged extra-marital encounters and having been accused of sexual assault by several women, which he denies \u2013 flew several times on the private jet of Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier who was convicted in 2008 of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. For some Redditers, it was a simple act of connecting some very, very distant dots to get from there to Comet Ping Pong.\n\nBut even after the election, the controversy refused to die down. Questions about \"#pizzagate\" persisted on Twitter and Facebook. Believers journeyed to the pizza place, posing questions to Alefantis and streaming Facebook Live videos. Finally, an armed man arrived.\n\nThough the \"#pizzagate\" conspiracy was widely shared by far-rightwing elements on the Internet who supported Donald Trump and distrusted Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the election, it was also spread by others. The author of the popular blog about \"#pizzagate\" is a self-proclaimed supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who claimed to vote for a third party on Election Day.\n\nThe son of incoming National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, also named Michael Flynn, tweeted about Welch's arrest on Sunday night: \"Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many 'coincidences' tied to it.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.83597874641419, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 689, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.67628081042, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.7416545718432501, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/07/search-continues-on-property-man-accused-grisly-crimes.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [77]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 797, "scraper_regex": 842}}, "headline": "Search continues on property of man accused of grisly crimes", "wordcount_as_scraped": 842, "date": "20161107090000", "story_content": "WOODRUFF, S.C. \u2013 \u00a0Investigators will continue Monday combing for human remains and other clues on the South Carolina property of a man accused of a grisly crime spree stretching more than a decade.\n\nTodd Kohlhepp became a suspect in at least seven deaths after a woman was found Thursday chained by her neck and ankle in a metal storage container on his 95-acre property near rural Woodruff.\n\nHis arrest in that case led to his confession in a notorious quadruple slaying at a motorcycle shop from 2003 in the small town of Chesnee, investigators said. He was denied bond Sunday during a brief court appearance on four murder charges for those slayings.\n\nHe's also charged with kidnapping the woman, and more criminal counts are expected. Authorities suspect he killed at least three people other than the motorcycle shop victims.\n\nA Spartanburg County Sheriff's investigative report says Kohlhepp \"confessed to investigators that he shot and killed\" the motorcycle shop's owner, service manager, mechanic and bookkeeper, giving details only the killer would know.\n\nNow, Sheriff Chuck Wright, who was first elected about a year after the Superbike Motorsports killings, has a wide-ranging investigation of a crime spree over more than a decade.\n\nThe investigation has expanded to other properties Kohlhepp, a real estate agent, either currently or used to own. Those properties are not limited to South Carolina, Wright said Sunday, declining to be more specific.\n\nBoth the FBI and Homeland Security are involved, he said.\n\nKohlhepp showed investigators Saturday where he says he buried two other victims on the property he bought two years ago. Human remains were uncovered Sunday at one of those sites, Wright said.\n\n\"We're not even close\" on identifying the remains or cause of death, he said. \"We can't tell anything.\"\n\nKohlhepp did not tell investigators who was buried there. Removing the remains to \"preserve every bit of evidence\" is a meticulous, time-consuming process, said Coroner Rusty Clevenger.\n\nThe gravesites Kohlhepp pointed to are in addition to the body found Friday in a shallow grave at the site. Authorities identified that victim as the boyfriend of the woman found Thursday. Clevenger said he died of multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nThe Associated Press is not naming the woman because the suspect is a sex offender, though authorities have not said whether she was sexually assaulted.\n\nOn Sunday, Kohlhepp appeared in an orange jumpsuit for the brief bond hearing and declined to make a statement. He didn't have an attorney.\n\nAfter Kohlhepp left the courtroom, Magistrate Judge Jimmy Henson told the family members they would have a chance later to address Kohlhepp in court.\n\n\"You have something to say. You've been waiting 13 years to say it,\" he said.\n\nThe father of Brian Lucas, the 29-year-old slain service manager, thanked the judge.\n\n\"Your honor, I appreciate your words to us and your counsel,\" Tom Lucas said as two others put their hands on his shoulders. \"We thank you.\"\n\nBefore the hearing, Lucas said he wanted to be in court to look Kohlhepp in the eye.\n\n\"I want to look at him, and I want to try to use that in healing,\" he said.\n\nBefore Kohlhepp emerged as a suspect, investigators had said all four victims were killed with the same pistol. They have theorized that the killer came in the back and killed mechanic Chris Sherbert, 26, as he worked. Bookkeeper Beverly Guy, 52, was found just outside the bathroom in the middle of the showroom.\n\nThirty-year-old shop owner Scott Ponder was found just outside the door in the parking lot. He was Guy's son. Brian Lucas was in the doorway of the shop.\n\nMelissa Ponder, who was married to Scott Ponder, said detectives told her Kohlhepp was an angry customer who had been in the motorcycle shop several times.\n\n\"It isn't closure, but it is an answer,\" Ponder said by phone. \"And I am thankful for that.\"\n\nKohlhepp was released from prison in Arizona in 2001. As a teenager, he was convicted of raping a 14-year-old neighbor at gunpoint and threatening to kill her siblings if she called police.\n\nKohlhepp had to register as a sex offender. But that didn't stop him from getting a South Carolina real estate license in 2006, building a firm and maintaining the appearance of normalcy.\n\nIn Woodruff on Sunday, scores of people congregated outside the chain link fence that surrounds the wooded property.\n\n\"Things like this don't happen at home,\" said Tina Gowan, who lives in Pauline but grew up in Moore, where Kohlhepp lived. \"He looked like your everyday Joe.\"\n\nShe was among those who prayed at the fence.\n\nFrances Bradley, who lives near the 95-acre site, said God answered prayers in solving the 2003 cold case.\n\n\"I was so awe-struck by the revelation,\" she said, she felt a need to pray at the fence before going to church. \"I thanked God for giving us good out of this.\"\n\n___\n\nKinnard reported from Spartanburg, South Carolina.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan Drew in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.02857160568237, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 797, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.59688306492, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161107090000, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.1367628607277296, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/27/britains-theresa-may-is-here-and-winston-churchill-is-back.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [882, 1153, 1346, 1457, 1719, 1856, 2305, 3007, 3819, 3907]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 851, "scraper_regex": 942}}, "headline": "Britain's Theresa May is here and Winston (Churchill) is back", "wordcount_as_scraped": 942, "date": "20170127190000", "story_content": "In September of 1939, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appointed Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty for the War Cabinet. The message \"WINSTON IS BACK\" was signaled to all naval ships and installations announcing this appointment in which Churchill stepped back into a role he had held decades before.\n\nPresident Trump has, for his part, signaled his own \"WINSTON IS BACK\" moment, by symbolically returning the bust of Churchill to the White House, that Obama sent back to the UK when he assumed office. Far beyond symbolism, Trump is signaling, with Prime Minister Theresa May, his own reset of the Special Anglo-American Relationship, and it couldn't have come at a more propitious time.\n\nMrs. May arrived in the U.S. on Thursday, as the coveted first government head to officially visit the U.S., post-election.\u00a0 This is a proud and promising moment for both leaders and one that bodes great potential for the nations they lead respectively and the partnership that they have expressed interest in resetting and strengthening.\n\nHer introductory speech in Philadelphia was inspiring.\u00a0 In it she tackled many of the issues foremost on the minds of Americans\u2014threats from Islamic terrorism, cyber terrorism, our role within international organizations such as the U.N. and NATO.\u00a0 She spoke of the opportunities for her nation and our own in a post-Brexit, outward-looking \"Global Britain.\"\u00a0 She referenced the great friendship that was the apogee of the Special Relations\u2014the Reagan-Thatcher friendship\u2014and drew a parallel to their efforts to free the countries of Eastern Europe shackled by socialism, that Churchill identified as \"the Iron Curtain.\"\u00a0 She ended this speech on a hopeful note that our better future is within reach and that we, Britain and America will build it together.\u00a0 Mrs. May sets the tone for a greatly enhanced bi-lateral alliance, moving forward.\n\nWhile the sheer global importance of the Special Relationship has historically transcended personalities, the last eight years have been challenging. President Obama's approach of one global community, where Britain and other traditional allies enjoyed no special status, but were simply colleagues in the community of nations, challenged our strongest alliances.\u00a0 Not to mention Obama's intervention into the Brexit debate where he predicted a \"back of the queue\" position for the UK were it to leave the EU.\n\nThis attitude and approach must and likely will be altered. Judging by Mr. Trump's statement during his inaugural address that the U.S. will \"unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth,\" it is clear that he intends to recommit to a traditional post-WWII role of ensuring stability. In order for the new administration to do so it needs a steady partner in the UK, a nation, unlike many of its European colleagues, that takes its military and financial obligations seriously.\u00a0\n\nIn a world where ISIS is rampaging, mercilessly slaughtering innocents, with especial enmity towards Middle East Christians, America needs its allies more than ever \u2013 and America has no better ally than Great Britain. Britain needs America, too. From the First World War to the War on Terror, the world is safer when the Anglosphere is aligned and working harmoniously.\n\nIndeed, the Brexit decision is part of a larger global re-asserting of national sovereignty and personal responsibility of nations, perhaps crowned by the election of Mr. Trump. Moreover, a central theme of this momentum includes direct trade negotiations and agreement between nations and will surely come to light as Mrs. May hopes to score a bi-lateral US-UK trade pact which would strengthen Britain's unsure road as it leaves the EU.\u00a0 It seems she has a willing ally in President Trump, for, as the London Times reported:\u00a0 \"Donald Trump will offer Britain a quick and \"fair\" trade deal with America within weeks of taking office to help make Brexit a \"great thing.\"'\n\nThere is good reason on both sides of the Atlantic to pursue this trade agreement. The figures alone are compelling: the US is the largest investor in the UK and bi-lateral trade mounts to nearly $187 billion. Furthermore, a strong US-UK agreement will be a powerful arrow in May's quiver when she eventually must negotiate with Brussels.\n\nThe current Prime Minister has already spoken forcefully on this issue, \"So as we rediscover our confidence together \u2013 as you renew your nation just as we renew ours \u2013 we have the opportunity, indeed the responsibility, to renew the special relationship for this new age. We have the opportunity to lead, together, again.\"\n\nThough history has moved on and so much has changed, the global importance of the Anglo-American partnership has endured and even increased. Churchill, first coined the phrase \"Special Relationship,\" as far back as 1946 in his \"Sinews of Peace\" speech at Fulton, Missouri, in which he explained: \"\u2026not only the growing friendship and mutual understanding between our two vast but kindred systems of society, but the continuance of the intimate relationship between our military advisers, leading to common study of potential dangers, the similarity of weapons and manuals of instructions, and to the interchange of officers and cadets\u2026\"\n\nSeventy-five years hence, Theresa is here and 'WINSTON IS BACK' and is proving to be more relevant more inspirational than ever.\n\n\n\nAmanda Bowman is founder of The Anglosphere Society.

Washington also provides weaponry to the self-governing island democracy to help it guard against China's threat to use force to end their division dating from a civil war in 1949.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to upend that status quo since winning the November election.\n\nAlso Monday, the Chinese nationalist tabloid Global Times published an editorial blasting Trump's strategy and saying China would have a strong response to any reconsideration of Washington's long-standing \"one-China policy.\"\n\n\"In the past, Trump infuriated us, but now we find him risible,\" said the tabloid, which is published by the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's newspaper. \"With a skyrocketing ascent in his political life, he has been stunningly confident in his ostensible knowledge of the job, though he speaks like a rookie.\"\n\nThe English-language China Daily ran an editorial Monday accusing Trump of \"playing with fire.\"\n\n\"If Trump is determined to use this gambit on taking office, a period of fierce, damaging interactions will be unavoidable, as Beijing will have no choice but to take off the gloves,\" the newspaper said.\n\nChina was already angered by Trump's Dec. 2 phone call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, the first time an American president or president-elect has publicly spoken to Taiwan's leader in nearly four decades. Beijing considers any reference to a separate Taiwanese head of state to be a grave insult.\n\nTrump then said in a television interview that he didn't feel \"bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Reince Priebus, Trump's incoming chief of staff, said that \"there are no plans to change the one-China policy.\"\n\n\"But certainly that policy is on the table if China doesn't also come to the table and work with us on trade, work with us on the South China Sea and what's happening there,\" Priebus said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nAfter attacking China repeatedly during his campaign, Trump has continued to disparage China on his Twitter account over its military buildup in disputed areas of the South China Sea, its alleged currency manipulation to put American companies at a disadvantage, and what he says are its inadequate efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear program. He has also announced that a new White House trade council will be led by economist Peter Navarro, a sharp critic of Chinese economic policy who wrote a book titled \"Death By China.\"\n\nTrump told the Wall Street Journal that he would not label China a currency manipulator as soon as he takes office, though he repeated his contention that China is manipulating its currency, the yuan.\n\nSo far, Beijing has reiterated its refusal to negotiate on Taiwan and has pushed for positive cooperation with the U.S., though state-run media have printed several strongly worded editorials attacking Trump.\n\nChinese political observers said Sunday that they expect Beijing's response to change once Trump is inaugurated next week.\n\n\"Trump has not taken office yet, so he is an ordinary person now,\" said Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University. \"Therefore, there's no need for China to take his remarks seriously or further respond to what he said.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Henry Hou contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.2622332572937, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 724, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.44948974278, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170116130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0386740331491695, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/24/trump-faces-massive-challenge-in-cleaning-up-toxic-va.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [977, 1064, 1260, 1318, 1329, 1481, 1623, 1632, 1832, 2054, 2400, 2410, 2424, 2727, 3440, 4198, 4415]}}, "headline": "Trump faces massive challenge in cleaning up 'toxic' VA", "wordcount_as_scraped": 711, "date": "20170124220000", "story_content": "Between his vows to replace ObamaCare, build a border wall and renegotiate trade pacts, President Trump's inbox is mighty full his first week in office.\n\nBut one of the biggest challenges will be the Department of Veterans Affairs, where massive problems persist \u2013 many in the same hospital that was the epicenter of the waiting-list scandal that rocked the agency, and shocked the public, in 2014.\n\n\"Until Congress passes strong accountability measures, VA employees from top to bottom will have little incentive to change this toxic culture,\" said Mark Lucas, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America, a veterans' advocacy group.\n\nA recent survey of employees at the Phoenix facility reported employees have little confidence in the integrity of their supervisors -- findings Lucas called \"unsurprising.\" Two government audits also found little improvement and costly inefficiencies in the agency as a whole.\u00a0\n\nTrump, who vowed during the campaign to overhaul the scandal-scarred department, has\u00a0nominated Dr. David Shulkin, a VA undersecretary in the Obama administration, to take over.\n\nIf confirmed, Shulkin and Trump together will confront problems that extend well beyond morale issues.\u00a0\n\nThe Government Accountability Office for the third year\u00a0reportedly\u00a0will place the VA health system on its \"high risk\" list when it's released in February, because of continued problems of waste, fraud or mismanagement.\u00a0The forthcoming report will say the VA has showed \"only limited progress\" since the scandal erupted.\n\nThe VA Office of Inspector General also\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier this month that in 2015, the VA awarded more than $177 million in improper relocation or retention bonuses based on inaccurate information to 238 different employees, many of them executives.\u00a0The report blamed the VA for \"ineffective oversight processes to ensure compliance,\" and \"ineffective procedures to recoup funds from individuals with outstanding recruitment and relocation incentive service obligations.\"\u00a0\n\nAnd the January survey of employees at the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center in Phoenix \u2013 which has had seven directors since 2014 revelations about VA officials falsifying patient wait times as some died waiting for care \u2013 found fewer than one-third of employees feel their supervisors have integrity or that whistleblowers would be protected.\u00a0\n\nTrump's\u00a010-point plan\u00a0to reform the VA included firing bad employees; creating a special commission to investigate cover-ups; and ensuring veterans have the option of VA vouchers for private health care.\n\nThe department clearly is still high risk. Yet some of Trump's goals already are in the process of being realized, said\u00a0Joe Chenille, executive director for the veterans advocacy group AmVets.\n\n\"We have gone from 19 percent getting care from outside sources, paid for by the VA, to 31 percent,\" Chenelly told Fox News. \"My prediction is a surge of people will want care outside the system.\"\n\nShulkin, who has experience as a hospital CEO, came to the agency with now-former VA Secretary Bob McDonald to make reforms after the scandal, and has the confidence right now of the Trump administration.\n\n\"Dr. Shulkin is a nationally-recognized turnaround artist, health care leader, and passionate veterans advocate who is eager to transform the VA and will be able to do so in the Trump administration,\" Trump spokesman David White said.\u00a0\"If confirmed, Dr. Shulkin will be ready on day one to enact President Trump's 10-point plan to end mismanagement and incompetence at the VA, and ensure our veterans get the timely, quality care and support they deserve.\"\n\nA VA spokeswoman declined to comment and deferred to the Trump team.\n\nA new VA secretary isn't enough, though, said Lucas of the CVA.\n\n\"These are problems that arose as a result of a system that is set up to fail, a system no one leader can change without meaningful reforms from Congress,\" Lucas said. \"The VA needs to be transparent with veterans and taxpayers about its performance and how money is being spent. But most importantly, veterans deserve to be empowered with choice over where and when to see a doctor.\"\n\nIn September,\u00a0RimaAnn Nelson, became the seventh director of the Phoenix veterans health system since the 2014 scandal. Nelson is no stranger to other VA controversies.

Other days, bored and frustrated Mexican teens toss stones at the officers from behind the rocky shields. But now change is in the air, as people on both sides of the border \u2013 and the law \u2013 await the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump in the White House.\n\n\"We are very worried, no one was expecting those results,\" Martha Leticia Castaneda Rojas, Tijuana City Council member and president of the Border Affairs Committee, told FoxNews.com. \"We're all still in shock.\"\n\nRojas and others now fear Trump's plan to deport up to two million illegal immigrant criminals will flood the border city.\n\nAs it stands, Tijuana \u2013 a city of 1.3 million \u2013 has around 40 shelters for the homeless and deported, as well as an increasing number of refugees from earthquake-ravaged Haiti. These shelters are \"expandable,\" Rojas said, pointing out that they have already identified a parcel of land on which to establish a tent city, if need be.\n\nMexican officials are also bracing for Trump's policies with a campaign using social media, community outreach, a 24/7 toll free consular assistance hotline and mobile consulates across the country to make sure Mexicans \"know their rights,\" Rojas said.\n\nErika Santana, president of the Tijuana Attorney Bar Association and a prominent human rights leader, said the area could be overwhelmed if Trump follows through on his campaign pledge.\n\n\"This could become a total humanitarian crisis,\" Santana said. \"Currently, shelters are not equipped for more people.

But we have to be ready.\"\n\nAnother controversial cornerstone of Trump's immigration plan consists of building a wall along the border, which he insists Mexico will fund. Currently, around 15 percent of the border is protected by a steel barricade. The first fencing was built in the 1950s, and more stringent structures went up in the mid-90's under President Clinton's Operation Gatekeeper.\n\nFor Shawn Moran, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, Trump's policies come as a welcome relief.\n\n\"Agents do this job because they want to serve their country and what we have been doing is a disservice \u2013 allowing people that have broken laws to stay,\" Moran said. \"The wall is one tool that we have; we need to be able to secure our borders.\"\n\nSan Diego-based Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., agreed that securing the border is paramount \u2013 both for national security, as individuals from all nations with possible terrorist ties can also use Mexico as an entry point - as well as overall crime reduction.\n\n\"Walling works. We had the first wall in San Diego,\" he said. \"By FBI statistics, it reduced crime by 50 percent here and drug trafficking by ninety.\"\n\nBut for some Mexicans, the issue is about money, not the notion of being fenced in \u2013 or out.\n\n\"The U.S. has the full right to build a wall if they think it will help,\" said State Council member and National Action Party (PAN) Adrian Garcia, staring out at the high fence partitioning the beaches of Playas de Tijuana and Imperial Beach, which abruptly stops in the ocean. \"But if the U.S tries to force Mexico to pay for it; that is what is causing a lot of upset and anger.\"\n\n\n\nHollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

Others promise or already are extending physical sanctuary by housing immigrants.\n\nIn Brockton, a poor city of about 95,000 people south of Boston, four churches have pledged to take in immigrants fearful of being deported.\n\n\"If you need a safe place, once you enter the doors of this building, you are safe,\" said the Rev. Abraham Waya, pastor of Central United Methodist Church, who said his church can shelter as many as 100 people. \"We will host you and take care of you for as long as it takes.\"\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump pledged to \"immediately terminate\" President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration, including the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which has extended work permits and temporary deportation relief to more than 700,000 immigrants brought here illegally as youths.\n\nIn an interview with Time magazine published this week, Trump adopted a more sympathetic tone toward young immigrants, saying, \"We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud.\"\n\nA spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the agency follows a 2011 policy to generally avoid entering \"sensitive locations\" such as schools, places of worship and hospitals to take custody of immigrants in the country illegally. The policy says enforcement actions can be conducted in those locations in cases of terrorism or when there are \"exigent circumstances.\"\n\nAbout 450 houses of worship of various denominations nationwide have offered to provide some form of sanctuary, including living space, financial assistance or rides for schoolchildren, said Alison Harrington, pastor of Southside Presbyterian Church in Tucson, Arizona.\n\nImmigrants have been fearful for decades, particularly as deportations increased during the Obama administration, said Harrington, who is involved in the sanctuary movement on a national scale. But Trump's campaign promises to build a wall along the Mexican border, to bar Muslims from entering the country and to deport millions \"has really galvanized people,\" she said.\n\nThe Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, with more than 140 congregations, has adopted a resolution calling for \"holy resistance\" to Trump's immigration proposals and declaring itself a \"sanctuary diocese.\"\n\nIn Philadelphia, a coalition of 17 churches and two synagogues said it has seen a huge uptick in the number of volunteers for a program offering support to immigrants when ICE raids their homes. The program had 65 volunteers in May. In the two weeks following Trump's win, more than 1,000 new volunteers signed up, said Peter Pedemonti, executive director of the New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia.\n\n\"We know that we're in a different historical moment right now and that our faith compels us to take increasingly bold actions,\" Harrington said.\n\nSome churches have already made good on their promises.\n\nIn Philadelphia, a 40-year-old man from Mexico has been living in the Arch Street United Methodist Church for three weeks.\n\nJavier Flores entered the U.S. illegally in 1997 and has been deported and re-entered several times since then. After being held in an ICE detention center for over a year, the agency released him for 90 days so he could prepare for deportation. He did not want to be separated from his wife and three children, so he sought refuge, said the Rev. Robin Hynicka, senior pastor.\n\n\"For us, we feel it's a moral obligation to keep families together,\" Hynicka said.\n\nIngrid Encalada Latorre, an immigrant from Peru, took sanctuary last week with her year-old son, Anibal, at a Quaker meeting house in Denver.\n\nLatorre, 32, has exhausted appeals of a deportation order and is awaiting a decision on a final, discretional appeal to immigration officials in Washington.\n\nShe left her native Cusco, Peru, in 2000 to join an aunt in Colorado, where she found work as a dishwasher, cared for kids, cleaned homes and worked at assisted living centers, she said. In 2002, she bought fake papers from an unscrupulous street seller.\n\nShe was arrested in 2010 and pleaded guilty to a felony ID theft charge. She paid $11,500 in back taxes and successfully completed parole, but her guilty felony plea brought her to ICE's attention. Advocates arranged for LaTorre and Anibal to stay in the meeting house.\n\nAnibal, a U.S. citizen, is being treated at Denver's Childrens Hospital for a congenital twisted neck condition; her other son, 8-year-old Bryant, is also a U.S. citizen and attends a bilingual school in suburban Westminster.\n\n\"I have lived half of my life here,\" she said. \"Don't be afraid.

It's not fair, especially to their families.\"\n\nDarcy's hope is that the military will exhume the four gravesites, identify the remains and rebury them with a proper memorial.\n\nThe Pentagon still officially lists 136 Turner sailors as missing. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the federal office responsible for recovering and identifying the nation's missing war dead, didn't respond to repeated requests from The Associated Press about Darcy's findings.\n\nThe Turner, a 10-month-old destroyer returning from convoy duty in the Atlantic, was anchored a few miles off Sandy Hook, New Jersey, when an explosion erupted below deck, setting much of the ship ablaze. More explosions followed, the last breaking the ship in two.\n\nWhile no cause of the initial blast was ever determined, a Navy report mentioned anti-submarine munitions were being defused around the time.\n\nMore than 150 men were rescued, but 136 others went down with the ship, according to Darcy's research. He said the Navy's National Archives file on the yearlong salvage operation contains no information, including how many sets of remains were eventually recovered from the 55 feet of water where the ship sank. Darcy contends many of the bodies would have likely been intact on the ship in compartments sealed with watertight doors.\n\nAccording to 1944 interment records for the Long Island veterans cemetery in Farmingdale, the remains of four Turner sailors were buried in individual graves within a year of the disaster.\n\nBut Darcy, a retired Marine from Locust Grove, Virginia, believes all or most of the remains were found and comingled in the four graves. \"I went to the Navy and they said, 'Hey, we don't know how many are in there,'\" he said.\n\nDarcy said comingling of unidentified remains was a fairly common practice, particularly when the Navy was overburdened at the height of World War II. The Long Island cemetery has multiple graves containing the remains of more than one WWII serviceman, while the remains of 388 USS Oklahoma crewmembers disinterred in 2015 for identification were buried in 45 mass graves in Hawaii.\n\nAnother WWII MIA expert, Mark Noah, founder of Florida-based History Flight, said he \"wouldn't doubt it at all\" if Turner graves contained the remains of multiple sailors. \"Skeletal remains can pack out a full coffin with more than a dozen people,\" he said.\n\nLoved ones from the Turner disaster were initially told only that their sailor was missing. If remains had been found and buried, they were never informed.\n\n\"Oh, my goodness. I would've liked to have known that,\" 82-year-old Marjorie Avery, of Corsicana, Texas, told the AP by phone. Her father, Henry S. Wygant Jr., was the Turner's captain and still officially listed as missing.\n\nSeveral relatives of now-deceased Turner sailors who survived the disaster told the AP their loved ones also were never told about the graves. Two of the last Turner survivors still living \u2014 James Thomas, of Leivasy, West Virginia, and Robert Mowry, of Irwin, Pennsylvania \u2014 also said they didn't know.\n\nMore than 70 years later, their memories of the disaster remain clear yet tinged with stoicism typical of so many WWII veterans.\n\n\"It's just one of those things that happen in a war,\" said Mowry, 91. \"It was just us at the wrong place at the wrong time, that's all.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press investigative researcher Randy Herschaft in New York contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.0825920104980495, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 715, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.1570464280299997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161120170000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 3.3566433566433598, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/18/when-it-comes-to-inaugural-crowds-does-size-matter.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [65]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 875, "scraper_regex": 920}}, "headline": "When it comes to inaugural crowds, does size matter?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 920, "date": "20170118170000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0Donald Trump says his inauguration will have \"an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout.\" Organizers of a protest the next day call in the biggest demonstration in history to welcome a new president.\n\nExactly how many people actually show up for both events will likely never be known.\n\nCounting the number of people at major public events is as much art as science, and there will be no official tally of how many people attend either Friday's inaugural festivities or the Women's March on Washington on Saturday.\n\nHere's a look at why crowd size is so mysterious.\n\n___\n\nIT STARTS WITH THE MILLION MAN MARCH\n\nFor decades, the National Park Service provided official crowd estimates for gatherings on the National Mall. That changed after the Million Man March in 1995, a gathering of black men meant to show renewed commitment to family and solidarity. The park service estimated 400,000 people attended the march, making it one of the largest demonstrations in history in Washington.\n\nBut organizers believed they reached their goal of 1 million participants. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, one of the march organizers, threatened to sue the park service, arguing its count was motivated by \"racism, white supremacy and hatred for Louis Farrakhan.\" Researchers at Boston University did an independent analysis and said the crowd was much bigger, pegging it at more than 800,000.\n\nNo lawsuit was filed, but the dispute was enough to get the park service out of the head-counting business. The following year, Congress passed an appropriations bill that barred the agency from spending money to count crowds. While that language didn't appear in subsequent budgets, refusing to count crowds became park service policy.\n\nThe agency still estimates crowd size for its own planning purposes, but does not publicly reveal the figures.\n\n\"No matter what we said or did, no one ever felt we gave a fair estimate,\" U.S. Park Police Maj. J.J. McLaughlin, who had been in charge of coordinating crowd estimates, said in 1996 when the agency confirmed it would no longer count heads.\n\n___\n\nHOW CROWDS ARE COUNTED\n\nBefore it stopped, the park service came up with its crowd figures by studying aerial photographs. Using a grid system, the park service would divide the Mall into sections of equal square footage. Then it counted the number of people in each section of the grid by looking at how tightly packed the crowd was and assigning a number of people per square foot.\n\nNot much has changed since about the way crowds are estimated, said Steve Doig, a journalism professor at Arizona State University who specializes in measuring crowd sizes.\n\nThe figure that corresponds to a \"loosely packed crowd,\" Doig said, is 10 square feet per person, \"which sounds like a lot but it's really not.\" That means people could reach out and touch those closest to them on all sides.\n\n\"A tighter crowd would get down to maybe 6 or 7 square feet per person,\" he said. \"A scary mosh pit crowd would be maybe 3 to 4 at most.\"\n\nCrowd estimates for events in Washington are difficult in general because the city's lack of tall buildings and security restrictions on aircraft make it tough to get comprehensive aerial images, Doig said.\n\nChristopher Geldart, the District of Columbia's homeland security director, has said consistently that he expects between 800,000 and 900,000 people to attend Trump's inauguration. He said he would use the tried-and-true grid method to provide his own crowd estimate on the Monday after the swearing-in.\n\n___\n\nWOMEN'S MARCH\n\nThe largest-ever demonstration in Washington, according to park service figures, was an anti-Vietnam War protest in 1969 that drew 600,000 people. The Mall can easily accommodate crowds in the hundreds of thousands; between 300,000 and 400,000 regularly attend the July Fourth fireworks.\n\nOrganizers of Saturday's Women's March on Washington have received a permit from D.C. police for a gathering of 200,000 people. Geldart said he expects the number of participants to exceed that figure, based on data including bus, hotel and train bookings. He cautioned, however, that organizers have not yet told authorities to expect more than the permitted total.\n\n___\n\nPAST INAUGURATIONS\n\nThe park service did not dispute a widely reported estimate that 1.8 million people came to Washington for President Barack Obama's first inauguration in 2009, believed to be the largest inaugural crowd in history. The biggest crowd the park service counted at an inauguration was 1.2 million for Lyndon Johnson's 1965 swearing-in.\n\nDoig isn't sure about either of those figures. His analysis of aerial photographs led him to conclude that just 800,000 were on the Mall for Obama's first inauguration, though he did not include the parade route, where thousands more people waited all day to catch a glimpse of America's first black president.\n\nThe estimate was difficult because the density of the crowd varied widely, he said, despite aerial photographs that appeared to show the Mall full of people between the Capitol and the Washington Monument. Further away from the Capitol, people huddled around television monitors, leaving big tracts of mostly empty space.\n\nAny time a crowd reaches into the hundreds of thousands, it's a noteworthy gathering, Doig said, but boosters will always try to politicize the turnout for their chosen cause.\n\n\"One of the things that aggravates me ... is the need for it to be huge,\" he said. \"It sort of drives the numbers into areas where it just clearly is fiction and it undercuts the reality of what really is an amazing crowd.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.1482254266738898, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 875, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.91014784866, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170118170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.85714285714286, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/23/scenes-panic-as-hundreds-iraqis-flee-fighting-in-mosul.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Scenes of panic as hundreds of Iraqis flee fighting in Mosul", "wordcount_as_scraped": 654, "date": "20161123200000", "story_content": "They came by the hundreds \u2014 men, women and children fleeing the battle for Mosul, some bloodied and crying out for help. So large was the crowd on the road that Iraqi troops initially ordered them back, worried that an Islamic State suicide bomber could be hiding among them.\n\nMosul's residents are fleeing in growing numbers as Iraqi forces push deeper into the country's second largest city, and the battle-hardened extremists are fighting for every block, exploiting the dense urban terrain and using civilians as human shields.\n\nOn Wednesday the tide of displaced people reached the Samah district, where Iraqi medics treated dozens of wounded, including at least six soldiers.\n\nAt one point, four children and a man from the same family were rushed into the station, bleeding heavily as their relatives wailed in grief. A mortar round had slammed into the inner courtyard of their home. A few minutes after being brought to the aid station, a 16-month-old girl with a head wound was pronounced dead.\n\nThen the main rush came \u2014 hundreds of civilians racing forward on a dirt road. The troops ordered them to halt, saying they had intelligence that ISIS might send suicide bombers disguised as civilians. One of the men raised his shirt to show that he wasn't armed, saying he was desperate for food.\n\nMosul, which fell to ISIS in the summer of 2014, is still home to more than 1 million people. Fearing a mass exodus, authorities have urged residents to stay inside their homes. But the presence of civilians has prevented the U.S.-backed Iraqi forces from using overwhelming force, slowing their advance and prolonging the city's agony.\n\nThe U.N. says at least 68,000 people have fled the fighting in Mosul, including 8,300 over the past four days.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Iraqi soldiers arrived from the front lines with a man who was bound and hooded. They said they had caught him burning tires to help the militants hide from airstrikes and the drones that buzzed overhead. Trembling, the man said he had been forced to aid the extremists.\n\nBlack Humvees carried wounded soldiers back from the front. The body of a special forces soldier killed in combat was wrapped in a blanket on the hood of a vehicle. The Iraqi military does not release official casualty figures, but field medics say dozens of troops have been killed and wounded since the Mosul operation began last month.\n\nMortar rounds, artillery and gunfire rang out throughout the day, punctuated by occasional booms from airstrikes that sent plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nA pre-dawn airstrike by the U.S.-led coalition struck a bridge across the Tigris River, which divides the city in two, leaving only one crossing intact and disrupting ISIS supply lines. It was the second bridge to be struck this week, and two other bridges were destroyed by airstrikes last month.\n\nUntil now, most of the fighting has been on the eastern bank of the Tigris. Iraqi forces are expected to use pontoon bridges when they reach the river.\n\nA spokesman for one of several state-sanctioned Shiite militias meanwhile said they had seized a road to the northwest of Mosul linking the city to Raqqa, the de facto capital of the ISIS self-styled caliphate. The militias have been converging on Tal Afar, an ISIS-held town west of Mosul that had a Shiite majority before falling to the extremists in 2014.\n\n\"We have cut off Tal Afar from Mosul and we cut off Mosul from Syria,\" Jaafar al-Husseini, a spokesman for the Hezbollah Brigades, told The Associated Press.\n\nElsewhere in Iraq, more than a dozen small-scale attacks in and around Baghdad killed at least 31 people and wounded 103, according to police and health officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.\n\nISIS still regularly targets the capital despite suffering a series of battlefield losses elsewhere in the country over the past year.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.8125, "HarmVice": 15, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 636, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.25236929583, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161123200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.30188679245283, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/17/mounting-frustration-in-damascus-amid-widespread-water-cuts.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [77]}}, "headline": "Mounting frustration in Damascus amid widespread water cuts", "wordcount_as_scraped": 782, "date": "20170117100000", "story_content": "DAMASCUS, Syria \u2013 \u00a0Omar Tarshan had never visited any of Syria's famous public baths until three weeks ago, when a water shortage in his Damascus neighborhood forced him to look for an alternative place to shower.\n\nOn Monday night, the 25-year-old accountant came with a colleague, Safwat Hariri, to the 1,000-year-old bath house in the old quarter of Damascus \u2014 the Hammam al-Malik al Zahir \u2014 where each was given two towels, a loofah and a piece of traditional olive oil soap. Minutes later, they stepped into the bath, enveloped by thick vapor.\n\nThe two men share the frustration of many other residents of the Syrian capital, forced to wait in long lines to fill their jerry cans after fighting with rebels in a valley northwest of Damascus cut off the main water line for the city last month. The more affluent, pay tanker trucks to come and fill up their tanks at home.\n\n\"We have no water at home and so I discovered the public bath,\" said Tarshan, a terry cloth wrapped around his waist.\n\nThe bath house, like others in Syria, has its own well and doesn't rely on the public water network.\n\nSince Dec. 22, the fighting in Barada Valley has severely restricted the flow of water to Damascus, piling up more hardship on the city's 5 million people already suffering massive power cuts, rising food prices and general erosion in all services as Syria's brutal conflict is about to enter its seventh year.\n\nPresident Bashar Assad's government forces fighting for control of the opposition-held Barada Valley say the rebels contaminated the area's Ein al-Fijeh spring with diesel. The rebels say government airstrikes damaged the water source.\n\nAs insulated as Damascus has been from the effects of the civil war that has torn much of the country apart, the recent water crisis has dominated the talk in much of the city.\n\nResidents line up in front of public taps with containers in hand; others crowd around huge water tankers parked in residential neighborhoods. Government-owned tanker trucks ferry water around the clock to hospitals. Prices of bottled waters have doubled, as the fighting-stricken valley \u2014 Wadi Barada in Arabic \u2014 is home to some of the country's most famous drinking water companies.\n\nA driver of one of the state-owned tanker trucks filled it up on Monday morning at a public tap in western Damascus, before heading across town to one of the e city's main hospitals. \"We cannot leave hospitals without water,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he did not have permission to talk to the media.\n\nThere are concerns of illnesses spreading because people and restaurants don't have enough water to wash produce and clean utensils properly.\n\nPrivate tanker truck owners are seeing their businesses boom. They sell 1,000 liters (264 gallons) of water for about $10 \u2014 a huge amount of money in a country where many people make no more than $100 a month.\n\nThe manager of the Damascus bath house, Bassam Kubab, said work has more than doubled since the water crisis began. But this has come at a cost to the quality of service, since he cannot afford to hire more staff, it would take too long for them to learn the business and who knows, by then the crisis might be over.\n\n\"This increase of work is not in our interest if we are speaking long term,\" Kubab said as dozens of customers crowded the bath house all at once \u2014 each paying $3.5 to use the showers.\n\nJihad al-Masri, a 52-year-old owner of a store that sells clothes, drove after work to a public tap in the western neighborhood of Mazzeh where he filled more than 10 containers to take home for washing dishes and showers.\n\n\"It has been more than 15 days and we don't have a drop of water,\" said the father of three girls. Instead of showering every other day, each family member now showers once a week, he said.\n\nSufian Mohammed Sharif came with his son in their pickup truck, packed with all kinds of small and large containers to take to their home in the suburb of Domar.\n\n\"In the past, we did not think about water ... now it has become a burden, an extra expense and humiliation,\" said the 55-year-old truck owner.\n\nAt one of the public taps in the Mazzeh neighborhood, about 20 people came to fill their water containers within half an hour.\n\n\"Not suitable for drinking,\" read a sign in Arabic above the tap.\n\nAmong those filling up was a small, elderly woman who was lugging several empty plastic bottles.\n\n\"We are the oppressed on earth,\" she muttered, mainly to herself, before slowly walking away toward her home.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.23529434204102, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 759, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.18938083251, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.23978919631094, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/24/asia-is-nervous-about-trump-but-us-india-ties-could-improve.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4566]}}, "headline": "Asia is nervous about Trump, but US-India ties could improve", "wordcount_as_scraped": 718, "date": "20161124210000", "story_content": "Some Asian nations are watching anxiously as Donald Trump prepares to take up the presidency, but for at least one major power in the region, India, the changing of the guard in Washington could strengthen ties.\n\nDuring a brutal election campaign, where Trump's rhetoric on foreign partners was overwhelmingly negative, he was largely positive about India -- or at least its Hindu majority -- and its nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi.\n\nWhen Trump courted Indian-American voters at a rally in New Jersey in mid-October, he said, \"There won't be any relationship more important to us.\" He praised Modi -- another populist who is savvy in using social media -- as a \"great man\" for championing bureaucratic reforms and economic growth.\n\nThere are other hints that Trump is well-disposed toward India.\n\nHe has done a lot of business there. A Washington Post analysis of Trump's pre-election financial disclosure found that of his 111 international business deals, the highest number -- 16 -- were in India. He stirred controversy last week over potential conflicts of interest by meeting with three Indian business partners who are building a Trump-branded luxury apartment complex in the city of Pune.\n\nOn Wednesday he selected South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the daughter of Indian Sikh immigrants, to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations -- the first woman tapped for a Cabinet-level post in his administration. Haley has no foreign policy experience.\n\nIt remains a matter of conjecture how any of this will shape the approach taken by a Trump administration when he takes office Jan. 20. But Lisa Curtis at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank said it was \"easy to envision\" the U.S. and India working closer on counter-terrorism.\n\nIndia hopes that Trump's promise to fight radical Islamic militants will mean more American pressure on Pakistan and less aid for India's historic archrival. Militants based in Pakistan are accused of launching cross-border attacks inside India.\n\nNeelam Deo, who heads the Mumbai-based think tank Gateway House, said India would also welcome it if Trump builds a working relationship with Russia in fighting the Islamic State group.\n\nBut Deo predicted U.S.-India friction if Trump restricts non-immigrant visas for Indians to try to protect American workers. She said that 60 percent of India's information technology experts who work abroad go to the U.S.\n\nBiswajit Dhar, an economics professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, said that how Trump approaches immigration is a major concern in India and tough action \"is going to rattle quite a lot here.\"\n\nLalit Mansingh, a former Indian ambassador to the U.S., said reactions in India to Trump's election victory have ranged from vocal support from right-wingers to shock and disappointment among the liberal intelligentsia. He said people had noticed that Trump had attended election campaign events with Hindus rather than the broader Indian-American community.\n\nIndia is 80 percent Hindu, but 14 percent of its 1.3 billion people are Muslims.\n\nU.S.-India relations have advanced under President Barack Obama, particularly since Modi's election in 2014. When Modi addressed Congress this June, he described the U.S. as an \"indispensable partner\" and said together they could anchor stability and prosperity from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific.\n\nStaunch U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea, which host American forces and depend on U.S. nuclear deterrence, have been unnerved by Trump's call for nations to shoulder more of the burden for security in Asia.\n\nBut that is less of a concern for India, which is not a formal ally of the U.S. It has expanded its military cooperation with Washington and purchased American hardware as it modernizes its armed forces. But it prizes having an independent foreign policy, as it did during the Cold War.\n\n\"India's interest in taking on a larger role fits in with Mr. Trump's view of U.S. friends and partners doing more in their own regions,\" said C. Raja Mohan, director of the Carnegie India think tank.\n\nTrump plans to take an ax to the main economic element of Obama's Asia policy -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

It was unclear which countries would be affected, though a draft of the order obtained by The Associated Press pointed to a legal provision identifying Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, all majority-Muslim countries.\n\n The city of Rutland, Vermont , had planned to welcome 100 refugees from Syria and Iraq, but with Trump's Friday order the community expects to see only the two Syrian families that arrived this month.\n\nAhmed Khatib, 37, said he, his wife Mahasen Boshnaq, and their three young children arrived there Jan. 19, and in a Friday interview he said they feel lucky. Day by day they are settling in and Khatib has started talking with people about getting work. After studying agricultural technology in college he hopes to finish his degree in the U.S. Khatib said he looks forward to being self-sufficient, working, having a home for his family and school and clothing for his children.\n\nHe doesn't think Trump's opinion reflects Americans, who he said want to allow refugees in the country.\n\n\"They are very nice and they are very helpful and welcoming,\" Khatib said. \"I care about what the America people want and I feel that they want refugees.\"\n\nAlabood said restricting the flow of refugees into the U.S. \u2014 out of concern that waves of refugees haven't been or can't be properly vetted by the U.S. to weed out the terrorism-minded \u2014 could deepen American suspicion and fan anti-Muslim hostility. Critics of the proposed moves have labeled them reckless and un-American.\n\n\"There are certain (American) people that would take it to an extreme\" and lash out, said Alabood, a former construction worker in his homeland. \"There are lots of people in desperate need of help, and this is a great country to help them,\" he added.\n\nAfghans and Iraqis who have worked as interpreters for the U.S. military fear the executive action that will bring sweeping changes to the nation's refugee policies will mean their families will be stuck in their homelands, where they may be targeted for violence because they have worked for the Americans. Recently arrived interpreters accompanied by military veterans and elected officials gave a news conference in San Diego on Friday, asking President Trump to not close the doors to refugees.\n\nAbdul Manan, 31, an Afghan interpreter who worked for the Army and special forces for eight years, arrived in San Diego two months ago. He fears for his family after fleeing his homeland amid death threats. It took him three years to get out on a special immigrant visa but his relatives remain in his village and have been threatened.\n\nManan suggested Trump talk to the military and veterans who will attest to the risk interpreters took to help troops.\n\n\"They have sacrificed their lives and their family's lives and now they are left behind. I think of the history of America. Is that how they do? If someone helps them and they're left behind, they're at the mercy of the terrorists \u2014 ISIS.\"\n\nSince settling in Missouri nine months ago, Alabood has chased the American dream, albeit in baby steps. He's earning $10.25 an hour making plastic car parts, trying to learn English and has a four-bedroom rental home to go along with his donated 2000 minivan. His $725 monthly rent tab leaves him unable to afford health insurance.\n\nYet he gushes of the graciousness of Kansas City, saying he's not been subjected to anti-Muslim sentiment in the Midwest. His brother has joined him, arriving in Kansas City five months ago with his three kids, ages 8, 6 and 4.\n\nIn Dallas, Alafandi enjoys a temporary protected status, which has allowed him to get a work permit and driver's license. Alafandi, who came with his family to the U.S. in 2014 and awaits word on his asylum application, has a tow truck business.\n\n\"Sometimes we feel that everybody is against us,\" fostering a feeling of being unwelcomed, he said. \"Our people are killed in Syria, and when they try to find a way to survive, people are kicking them out and dealing with them badly.\"\n\n\"I wish that we will be treated as a human beings that are seeking shelter and are seeking to be secure with our families,\" he added. \"We are just asking to be safe and find jobs and feed our kids.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jamie Stengle in Dallas, Lisa Rathke in Rutland, Vermont, Julie Watson in San Diego and Jim Salter in St. Louis contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 27, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.4074075222015403, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 949, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 7.52296758748, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 27, "mft_sum": 51, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170128060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.374077976817699, "mft_mean": 4.63636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/08/four-star-brass-say-no-fly-zone-would-work-again-in-syria.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Four-star brass say no-fly zone would work again in Syria", "wordcount_as_scraped": 808, "date": "20161208180000", "story_content": "Some of America's top military brass \u2013 active and retired \u2013 are in Iraq to commemorate a mission carried out a quarter of a century ago, and one they believe could still be dusted off and duplicated to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria.\n\nThe cadre of four-star American generals arrived in Kurdistan, Iraq, Thursday, where they will meet with Kurdish President Mahmoud Barzani to mark the 25th Anniversary of Operation Provide Comfort, the 1991 mission that helped keep some 450,000 civilians out of the crossfire as the U.S.-led coalition battled Saddam Hussein's forces. The operation established a \"no-fly\" zone in Northern Iraq, shielding the refugees from the brutal dictator's airpower.\n\nThe general consensus was that what worked against Saddam could work against ISIS, the black-clad jihadist army that helped plunge Iraq and Syria into conflict and chaos.\n\n\"I don't have a crystal ball that could have predicted if a mission like this would have solved everything, but there is a refugee problem, after an attack on civilians,\" retired U.S. Marine Corps Gen. James Jones told FoxNews.com. \"If they didn't examine it closely, they should have.\"\n\nJones, who was National Security Adviser to President Obama during his first term, said a reprise of Operation Provide Comfort was pushed after Obama failed to follow through on warning Syria that using chemical weapons would be crossing a \"red line.\" Critics say the administration's failure to back up its admonition emboldened Syrian President Bashar Assad, and worsened the humanitarian crisis as his forces battled rebels.\n\n\"You have a humanitarian catastrophe there,\" Jones said. \"At the time of the President's red line failure to implement any kind of consequence for Assad to attack his own people with chemical weapons, we contacted authorities and reminded them that there was a template out there -- an operation like OPC could be conducted in Syria.\"\n\nRetired Army Lt. Gen. Jay Garner, who was commander of Operation Provide Comfort, said creating a no-fly zone in Syria is the kind of leadership only the U.S. can provide.\n\n\"It can still be done, but it will be far more complicated than it would have been early on,\" Garner said. \"There are still areas in Syria to create safe zone for these refugees.\"\n\nAccording to the United Nations Refugee Agency, about 3.2 million Syrian refugees have been uprooted from their homes in a civil war that has killed an estimated 500,000 since it began in March 2011. Getting the displaced civilians to a zone within their homeland that can be protected is a key first step to saving lives and stemming the flow of refugees into Turkey and ultimately Europe.\n\n\"I recommend we do all we can to keep refugees in their general geographic areas and give them the quality of life they need,\" Garner said. \"We can do an awful lot by order of magnitude and can also eliminate the possibility -- and actuality -- of ISIS and other terrorist groups embedding themselves within the refugee population if we create these safe zones.\"\n\nGarner acknowledged obstacles to replicating the operation, including the complex nature of the multi-faceted war in Syria, where national forces, rebels, ethnic Kurds, ISIS, Al Qaeda, Russia, Iran, the U.S., Turkey and other multi-national armies are all embroiled in everything from open warfare to uneasy alliances.\n\n\"If you ally with the Syrian Rebels, you're taking on the Russians and the Kurds; if you ally yourself with Assad, you're in a Shia alliance and 85 percent of the Middle East is Sunni,\" Garner said. \"If Russia eliminates ISIS, they eliminate the Syrian rebels and the Syrian rebels should be our allies -- we need to protect them, and we need to continue to protect the Kurds.\"\n\nFormer Commandant of the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps Gen. Egbert Klop, who was part of the original mission and joined his American counterparts this week, said Operation Provide Comfort worked because it was carried out by a coalition of the \"able and willing\" with the United States in charge.\n\n\"Without the fast and extensive logistical support of the U.S. military, there couldn't have been an operation like this in the first place,\" Klop told FoxNews.com. \"I am absolutely convinced that from a military point of view, such an operation could be carried out again in Syria, if the Great Powers would have enough political will to do so -- it would prevent a lot of humanitarian suffering.\"\n\nThis week in Kurdistan, the military leaders will meet with Barzani and members of his cabinet to celebrate the mission and discuss how another generation of civilians can be saved from the ravages of war.\n\n\"The main thing is to gain control of the refugees and get rid of ISIS and once you do that, you get to imagine what post-war Syria will look like,\" Garner said. \"Nothing is ever easy, but hell, we're Americans -- we can do anything.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.2459893226623504, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 793, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.35748823866, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.16141235813367, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/14/army-corps-wants-more-study-on-dakota-access-oil-pipeline.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [75]}}, "headline": "Army Corps wants more study on Dakota Access oil pipeline", "wordcount_as_scraped": 640, "date": "20161114230000", "story_content": "BISMARCK, N.D.  \u2013 \u00a0The Army Corps of Engineers on Monday said it has finished a review of the disputed Dakota Access pipeline but wants more study and tribal input before deciding whether to allow it to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota.\n\nThe corps in July gave permission to pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners, but in September it said more analysis was warranted in the wake of American Indian concerns. The Standing Rock Sioux, whose reservation will be skirted by the $3.8 billion, four-state pipeline, says it threatens its drinking water and cultural sites.\n\nETP disputes that and said last week it is preparing to bore under the river.\n\nArmy Assistant Secretary Jo-Ellen Darcy said in a letter to company officials and tribal Chairman Dave Archambault that \"additional discussion with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and analysis are warranted.\" That discussion is to include potential conditions on an easement for the pipeline crossing that would reduce the risk of a spill.\n\nDarcy said in the letter that the Army will work with the tribe on a timeline \"that allows for robust discussion and analysis to be completed expeditiously.\" Army spokeswoman Moira Kelley would not elaborate to The Associated Press on whether a decision would be done by the time President Barack Obama leaves office. Donald Trump, a pipeline supporter, is set to take office in January.\n\nArchambault and ETP spokeswoman Vicki Granado did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe 1,200-mile pipeline is to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois.\n\nThe company building the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline said before the Army announcement Monday that it expects to finish construction by Dec. 1, except for the small disputed section in North Dakota, and could begin moving crude early next year if the government gives final approval.\n\nIn an email to The Associated Press, Dallas-based ETP said it would finish the pipeline within 120 days of getting approval for the easement beneath Lake Oahe, the Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota.\n\nAlso Monday, officials locked down the North Dakota Capitol after pipeline opponents gathered there, one day before groups planned more than 200 protests at Army Corps of Engineers offices and other sites across the country.\n\nNearly 470 protesters have been arrested since August supporting the Standing Rock Sioux.\n\nETP said it has suffered losses \"in the millions\" to vandalized equipment along the pipeline route in North Dakota. The company said it was taking steps to protect the pipeline from vandalism, but declined to disclose details.\n\nThe rallies set for Tuesday at such places as state Army Corps offices, federal buildings and offices of banks that have helped finance the project are seeking to draw Obama's attention.\n\nThe groups, including the Indigenous Environmental Network, Honor the Earth and Greenpeace USA, want Obama to permanently halt the construction of the pipeline, the focus of confrontations between police and protesters in North Dakota for months.\n\nA United Nations group that represents indigenous people around the world said the U.S. government appears to be ignoring the treaty rights and human rights of American Indians opposing the pipeline.\n\nThe Nov. 4 statement from the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues called on the government to \"protect the traditional lands and sacred sites of the Standing Rock Sioux and uphold their human rights commitments.\"\n\nForum member Edward John in late October visited a camp in North Dakota that's drawn hundreds of protesters from around the globe. He said he found a \"war zone\" atmosphere and that \"I felt as though I was in an armed conflict zone on foreign soil.\"\n\nJustice Department spokesman Wyn Horbuckle said the agency has been in communication with law officers, tribal officials and protesters \"to facilitate communication, defuse tensions, support peaceful protests, and maintain public safety.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.2189350128173797, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 625, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.17422922602, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161114230000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.52, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/06/law-enforcement-problem-families-can-fix.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 758, "scraper_regex": 829}}, "headline": "The law enforcement problem families can fix", "wordcount_as_scraped": 829, "date": "20170106230000", "story_content": "Last year the Kansas City (Kansas) Police Department lost two officers, both slain by gunmen. Today, Police Chief Robert McClarty says the fatalities have significantly impacted recruitment efforts.\n\n\"It has limited our number of applicants,\" he told The Hays Daily News on Tuesday. \"I believe it has also made people question more whether they want to be police officers.\"\n\nOPINION: WHAT A RECENT JAILHOUSE VISIT TAUGHT ME ABOUT MIRACLES\n\nThis is just one of the reasons attitudes toward law enforcement need to change -- and that change begins at home, facilitated by parents.\n\nIn 2016, law enforcement officers found themselves the target of criminals and would-be assassins who attacked and ambushed police at previously unseen levels. They also found themselves repeatedly vilified in the media and at risk in certain communities.\n\nFACEBOOK LIVE TORTURE VIDEO PART OF 'THE NEW NORMAL,' CHICAGO'S FORMER TOP COP SAYS\n\nIn 2016, 135 officers died on the job, with 64 dying by gunshot -- and that includes 21 that were killed in ambush attacks.\n\n\"LESMA [Law Enforcement and Supporters for Media Accountability] maintains a list unlike any other to demonstrate this war on police, by showing officers who have been shot throughout the year,\" Amanda Miller, director of civilian operations for the organization, told LifeZette. \"This year, 276 police officers have been shot [not all died], and 64 gave the ultimate sacrifice. That averages out to an officer shot 3 out of every 4 days, and 1.19 officers killed per week.\"\n\nCops will not be safer on America's streets in 2017 if current attitudes prevail.\n\n\"The last few years, we have seen an erosion of respect for law enforcement. That is unfortunate and very troubling,\" Sheriff Carolyn B. Welsh of Chester County, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia metro area, told LifeZette. \"Lately there have been men and women wounded and killed in the line of duty just because they wear a uniform. That is frightening. It is hard to comprehend that anyone would take the life of someone whose duty it is to serve and protect.\"\n\nMillennials in particular have been in the news frequently because of what could be termed a sense of entitlement and lack of respect. \"The younger generation was not taught respect for authority or government, not that government has earned it,\" said Miller. \"They haven't learned it in home or in our schools. They have been taught that no one gets hurt, everyone wins no matter what, and everybody owes them something. Consequences are never part of the equation.\"\n\nJohn Hoffman, a journalist and former chief of police from Town and Country, Missouri, has some ideas to heal the wounds inflicted this past year.\n\n\"Community policing is the key to mending relationships between the police and communities,\" he told LifeZette. \"However, true community policing is not what most people -- or even departments -- think.\"\n\nParents need to do their part by showing up at community events. Children will know that a relationship with law enforcement is of value when they see their parents value it.\n\n\"There are no quick fixes,\" he continued. \"It's important to build real relationships with communities, and you can only do that through time and involvement. I formed relationships with families, and with the kids in the families, who then became the teenagers and adults. Those ties don't break easily. Continually moving officers from precinct to precinct erodes relationships and community trust.\"\n\nWelsh echoed the sentiments of Hoffman. \"We need to work more with families and children, educating them about police, deputies, firefighters and all first responders. It starts at home -- showing respect for authority and teaching children not to fear cops and deputies. The Chester County Sheriff's Office works with families and children through many community outreach programs. These are things that build trust and confidence.\"\n\n\"You will be calling these brave men and women if you need assistance.\"\n\nMiller offers a concrete suggestion to help heal the rifts created in the vacuum left by President Obama's lack of leadership on this issue. \"Our police officers put their lives on the line for our families. They do a job that many cannot -- and do not -- try to understand. In this year of 2017, it would be good for the general public to resolve to seek information regarding police officers' jobs, and allow the justice system to take its course before taking anger out on law enforcement as a whole.\"\n\nShe puts the entire issue into proper perspective. \"You will be calling these brave men and women if you are in a situation where you need assistance -- and they will be there without fail. Who is going to be there for them when they are unjustly scrutinized or criticized? Let's make 2017 the year that the public understands and respects our law enforcement officers.\"\n\nCouncil Nedd, Ph.D., is a Pennsylvania State constable and an Anglican bishop living near Penn State University in State College, Pennsylvania.

Mounib, a 56-year-old endocrinology professor, is Morocco's most high-profile female politician. After two weeks of campaigning across the country in a cramped mini-bus, she will find out the next day if she has succeeded in getting the party she leads into parliament and winning a seat herself.\n\nIt's a moment she's worked for all her adult life, while raising three children. Even now, in the anxiety-tinged bustle, she's caught in the push-pull of a working mother. She excuses herself to rush home and help her son with his science homework.\n\n______\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of a series of profiles of Arab women fighting for change in different countries and areas of life.\n\n______\n\nMounib is still a rarity in the Arab world \u2014 a female politician in a leadership position. Morocco ranks 97th out of 145 countries on the gender gap in politics, according to the World Economic Forum. Many Arab countries score even lower.\n\nMounib says she learned early on that women have to outperform men to prove their worth.\n\n\"Women have to struggle extra hard in every aspect of what they do,\" she says. \"The main reason I decided to pursue politics was to reach these heights, to reach these ceilings, and to shatter them for other women...I want to create an example, a historic example, a successful example.\"\n\nDespite the hopes raised by the Arab Spring five years ago, women in the region still hold only 17.6 percent of seats in parliament, the second lowest score in the world. In Morocco, it's 20.5 percent, mainly because of a women's quota.\n\nIn this election, Mounib's Unified Socialist Party is allied with two others to form the Federation of the Democratic Left. She is accompanied on the white campaign bus by four young volunteers, including her 25-year-old daughter Dounia.\n\nThe mood is casual. Mounib insists that the driver eat with the team. He is almost instantly transformed from a random stranger into a supporter, sitting in the front row when she delivers her daily stump speech.\n\nHer calm only rarely gives way to irritation, mostly over planning mishaps. \"Honestly, I do feel this pressure,\" she later says about leading a national campaign.\n\nHer audiences \u2014 mostly men \u2014 listen without heckling or interruptions, a display of politeness fairly typical at such rallies in Morocco.\n\nThe husky-voiced Mounib is lively and confident. She took up karate when she was younger \u2014 a sport she says helped with concentration and public speaking.\n\n\"Our society teaches us to be shy and keep to ourselves,\" she says of women in Morocco. \"I've always been outspoken.\"\n\nMounib grew up in Casablanca as the seventh of nine children. Her father, a diplomat, encouraged her interest in politics, answering questions and giving her books. He also invited her to his office, where he received dignitaries. In a patriarchy, a supportive father is the key to a girl's confidence, she says.\n\nShe earned her doctorate at Montpellier University in France. After her return to Casablanca in the 1980s, she became a university lecturer, eventually rising to the leadership of the professors' union, and got involved in politics.\n\nDaughter Dounia says her father, who works in insurance, often fixed meals as her mother dashed off to meetings. Some of her girlfriends, even in their upscale Anfa district, would often be asked to serve their brothers, she says.\n\nHer mother is a role model, even if there's some friction. At one point on the trail, Mounib snaps at Dounia when she criticizes a decision on a social media post. The tension quickly dissipates.\n\n\"Just the fact that you see this woman being in charge of something this big makes you believe in anything,\" Dounia says. \"You see yourself in her.\"\n\nThe Federation has struggled to extend its appeal beyond urban, educated Moroccans. Mounib tries to reach rural audiences with demands for social justice -- narrow the wealth gap, fight nepotism, improve education.\n\nMorocco does not allow polling during campaigns, so Mounib has no idea how she is doing. But in some rural communities where men control the public space, her presence gives a jolt of hope to women.\n\nMounib \"gives strength to women because she is capable and equal to a man,\" says Chenna Hadhoum, a 38-year-old municipal clerk, at one stop. After the rally, Hadhoum wrestles with her shyness, and then walks up to Mounib and asks for a photo. She says it's been a day she will remember for a long time.\n\nMounib says she has encountered sexism even in a progressive movement like her own.\n\nIn her first year as party leader, she faced repeated challenges, mostly from male colleagues, and at times considered resigning. The possibility of failure is clearly on her mind. She resolves not to seek re-election as party leader if the Federation does poorly.\n\n\"If we fail, I'm going to go back and put on my sneakers, and get back to the grassroots,\" she says.\n\nHowever, Emna Ma Al Ainaine, an Islamist candidate, dismisses the Federation as marginal and claims Mounib comes off as elitist.\n\n\"We had debates,\" she says. \"Me, I am open, I am ready to listen to everyone .... But with Nabila, she believes she has the truth, just her, in Morocco.\"\n\nDounia says her mother has been skewered on Facebook for owning a pair of expensive sunglasses \u2014 which she takes off when talking in poorer communities. And a French publication noted in a profile that Mounib drove to the interview in a Volvo.\n\nEarly on Oct. 8th, the election results start to come in.\n\nEuphoria erupts at campaign headquarters, because the federation has secured two of 305 seats in district races.\n\nBut the two seats fall far short of the 10 to 12 Mounib had hoped for. And a few hours later, she hears on television that the federation did not cross the 3 percent threshold for the national vote, which determines 90 additional seats reserved for women and younger candidates. This means she won't get into parliament.\n\nMounib takes a few days to deal with the disappointment. A week later, she's back at party headquarters. She won't seek re-election as party leader, as promised, but she won't resign from the party either.\n\n\"I want a Morocco where equality between a man and a woman means that a woman can walk outside in a hijab or in shorts,\" she says, \"and be happy about being a woman.\"\n\nAP is interested in hearing about challenges faced by other Arab women.

But secondly, we would risk turning people who are currently inclined to resist ISIL\" or to join ranks with the coalition, \"potentially into resisting us, and that would increase the strength of the enemy.\"\n\nTaking over the war also would amount to \"fighting on the enemy's terms, which is infantry fighting in towns in a foreign country,\" he said. While U.S. troops can do that, it would not leverage the U.S. military's biggest strengths, which are special operation forces, mobility, air power and intelligence-gathering technologies \u2014 \"exquisite capabilities that no one else has,\" he said \u2014 to enable local troops to do the fighting and own the outcome.\n\nSo while he believes faster is better, \"It's important that it be done in a way that victory sticks.\" That was a reference to avoiding a repeat of the disastrous events of 2014, when Islamic State militants swept into western and northern Iraq from Syria and grabbed control of large swaths of territory as the Iraqi army collapsed. The Obama administration was caught by surprise at the hollowness of the Iraqi army, weakened by political and ethnic strife.\n\nThe AP interview was Carter's last as defense secretary. His designated successor, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, is expected to win easy Senate confirmation shortly after Trump is inaugurated on Friday. Carter will step down at noon on Friday.\n\nAt his confirmation hearing last week, Mattis gave only glimpses of his thinking on Iraq and Syria. When asked how his recommended way forward there would differ from the current approach, Mattis said, \"You give it full resourcing to get there as rapidly as possible, and I think it's getting there as rapidly as possible is probably where it would differ from the current administration, where it would be a more accelerated campaign from what the president-elect has already called for.\"\n\nTrump has not explained his plan for defeating the Islamic State militants but has sometimes suggested he would send more troops.\n\nThe U.S. war against the Islamic State group, which began in 2014, the year before Carter took office, became a major focus of his tenure, along with his efforts to modernize the Pentagon's approach to recruiting and maintaining talent. He has often said Obama was open to every suggestion for devoting more resources to the war, short of committing large numbers of combat troops.\n\n\"Early on, we were very limited by the meager intelligence we had on ISIL,\" he said. \"That limited how many bombs we could drop, because we didn't have targets, it limited where we could conduct raids, where we could vector forces, where we could try to create opposition to ISIL.\"\n\nBut as increasing amounts of territory have been recaptured in both Iraq and Syria, and growing numbers of ISIL leaders have been taken off the battlefield, the amount of useful intelligence has grown, he said.\n\n\"Even if you kill a guy, you get his phone and you learn something about ISIL,\" he said, adding that as the military campaign achieves more successes, \"more and more people come over and volunteer information; that creates yet more opportunities. So there's this virtuous circle, where the more you do, the more you have opportunity to do even more.\"\n\nCarter dismissed the idea that Obama has dragged his feet in Iraq or Syria.\n\n\"Everything we have been able to identify that would accelerate the defeat of ISIL, we have done,\" he said. \"We have not been, and we should not be, shy about asking for more\" authority or resources from the president to push the military campaign harder. \"I asked President Obama for more. I would encourage Jim Mattis, if he sees opportunities to accelerate, to ask for more.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.486026734113693, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 733, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.51606409147, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170119090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.72851296043656, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/02/in-remarkable-shift-peace-marks-s-korean-uprising-so-far.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [81]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 834, "scraper_regex": 891}}, "headline": "In remarkable shift, peace marks S.

In 2016, children launch flashing toys into the night air as entertainers lead a massive, docile crowd in popular sing-alongs.\n\nThis striking contrast \u2014 from hand-to-hand combat to scenes out of Disney \u2014 represents an accomplishment for South Korea, a democracy that was a dictatorship not too long ago and where social and political divisions still run deep.\n\nBut the current protests to force President Park Geun-hye from power over allegations she let a corrupt confidante pull government strings share an important quality with what came before: Now, as then, a popular movement is on the verge of pushing out a deeply unpopular leader.\n\nThat this peaceful, compartmentalized (mostly Saturdays, from around noon to midnight) uprising looks set to succeed is something of a surprise in a country with a long history of messy, often violent resistance.\n\nJust last year, protests against Park saw buses toppled and vandalized and a farmer get blasted with a water cannon and later die. Demonstrators in recent years have driven trucks into the gates of the Japanese Embassy, and lopped off their fingers in nearby streets, to protest territorial and historical disputes with Tokyo. The current U.S. ambassador's face was slashed last year by a South Korean activist.\n\nIn 1960 and the 1980s, often-violent mass protests forced one authoritarian leader to flee and a dictatorship to allow democratic elections.\n\nThe recent demonstrations have seen a collective effort at something novel: docility.\n\nProtesters plaster ubiquitous police buses with flower stickers. When some have climbed on the buses, they've been admonished by others to get down and be peaceful.\n\nSocial media have played a part.\n\nPeople have taken to Facebook and other platforms to encourage each other to protest calmly so they can bring their children to witness a part of history.\n\nOn the second Saturday protest, when organizers announced they would march toward the Blue House, many questioned online whether demonstrators risked violence by confronting the mass of police who would be guarding the president's residence and office. This forced organizers to make an additional pledge to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nThe authorities have also helped.\n\nCourt decisions forced the opening of streets closer to the Blue House where police had blocked protesters last year when violence erupted. Police have also avoided aggressive crowd control measures such as pepper spray and water cannons.\n\nThe labor and civic groups who organize the rallies have decided to use sheer numbers, not violence, to try to force Park out. So far, it has worked. Each Saturday for the last five weeks, the protests have drawn hundreds of thousands \u2014 organizers put last Saturday's crowd at 1.5 million.\n\nTo peel away such huge numbers from the delights of modern South Korean society \u2014 movie theaters, cafes, the comforts of warm, digitized homes \u2014 organizers have sought to appeal to families.\n\nVendors hawk plastic horns, toys, hotdogs and fish sticks. People set up picnic blankets and plastic mattresses beneath the stars.\n\nActors impersonating Park and her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, walk through the crowd, encouraging people to mock them. Children throw bean bags at Park pinatas and draw crayon caricatures of Park with captions that read, \"Park Geun-hye, boo!\"\n\nEntertainers on a huge stage keep people occupied with folk songs and instructions on how to move their candles and anti-Park placards in unison. Giant speakers are so loud that people have trouble talking to one another, even blocks away from the main stage.\n\nThis isn't to say that there's been a complete absence of violence since the scandal broke.\n\nPolice say a man drove a piece of construction equipment into the gate of the Seoul prosecutors' office in anger over the allegations against Park. And a man was arrested this week for allegedly burning the birthplace of Park's late dictator father, Park Chung-hee, because she refused to immediately step down.\n\nThe main protests, however, have been both peaceful and startlingly effective.\n\nWhen the rallies began, politicians worried about pushing for Park's resignation, let alone impeachment, fearful that they would make the president look more victim than tyrant and, through their aggressiveness, sway the course of next year's presidential election.\n\nBut the huge crowds emboldened lawmakers to seek an impeachment vote, although Park has slowed that effort with a recent offer to resign if parliament can set up a path to peacefully hand over power. Lawmakers still plan to vote on impeachment next week, and many believe that Park won't be able to serve out her single five-year term, which ends in early 2018.\n\nEven so, there's some worry among organizers that the longer Park clings to power, the harder it will be to draw huge crowds.\n\nLess people could mean rising frustration among hardcore union and civic groups who could then step up their aggression toward police. This is what happened in 2008 when massive crowds came out to protest U.S. beef imports amid unfounded fears of mad cow disease.\n\nFor now, however, the soundtrack of defiance at these protests has been a multitude of voices lifted together in song, not rage, and the laughter of children playing at their parents' feet.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFoster Klug is AP's Seoul bureau chief and has covered the Koreas since 2005.

Thousands of people banged pots, waved Cuban flags and whooped in jubilation. \"Cuba si! Castro no!\" they chanted, while others screamed \"Cuba libre!\"\n\nHowever, Castro was honored and mourned by some present and former national leaders \u2013 especially in Central and South America governments that have remained close to the Castros through the decades.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro recalled Castro's departure from Mexico on the yacht Granma with his brother Raul and several dozen supporters to start their revolution.\n\n\"Sixty years after the Granma sailed from Mexico, Fidel sails toward the immortality of all those who fight their whole lives,\" Maduro tweeted. \"Onward to victory, always!\"\n\nBolivian President Evo Morales said on Twitter that Castro was \"the leader who taught us to fight for the sovereignty of the state and the dignity of the peoples of the world.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, the president of El Salvador, said he felt \"deep sorrow ... of my friend and eternal companion\" and Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto tweeted: \"Fidel Castro was a friend of Mexico, promoting bilateral relations based on respect, dialogue and solidarity.\"\n\nEcuadorian President Rafael Correa said Castro inspired the progressive and integration processes in Latin America.\n\n\"We're sad, but at peace, because the commander completed his mission, blazing paths that have inspired many of us who desire a more just, more equitable, more equal Latin America,\" Correa said.\n\n\"Cuba is in mourning, Latin America is in mourning,\" he said during his regular Saturday address.\n\nPope Francis was also quick in offering his condolences.\n\nIn a telegram to Raul Castro, he offered his \"sense of grief to your excellency and family.\"\n\nIn a sign of his personal esteem, Francis signed the telegram, breaking from the Vatican's usual practice of have the secretary of state send such messages. Francis met Castro during the papal visit to Cuba in September 2015.\n\nAlso by telegram to Raul Castro, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the \"free and independent Cuba which he and his allies built became an influential member of the international community and became an inspiring example for many countries and nations.\"\n\nA statement from the Spanish government hailed Castro as \"a figure of enormous historical importance.\"\n\n\"As a son of Spaniards, former president Castro always maintained close relations with Spain and showed great affection for his family and cultural ties. For this reason Spain especially shares the grief of Cuba's government and authorities,\" the government statement said.\n\nThere were shouts and insults in Madrid as a small crowd composed of both pro- and anti-Castro supporters met in front of the Cuban embassy.\n\n\"Fidel Castro in the 20th century did everything possible to destroy the colonial system, to establish cooperative relations,\" former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was quoted as telling the Interfax news agency.\n\n\"Fidel survived and strengthened the country during the most severe U.S. blockade, while there was enormous pressure on him, and still led his country out of the blockade on the road of independent development.\"\n\nBased on reporting by the Associated Press and EFE.\n\nLike us on\u00a0Facebook\n Follow us on\u00a0Twitter &\u00a0Instagram\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.3698630332946797, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 603, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.07370118226, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161126180000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.31177446102819, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/25/as-trump-targets-immigration-2-million-criminal-noncitizens-already-inside-us.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1021]}}, "headline": "As Trump targets immigration, 2 million criminal noncitizens already inside US", "wordcount_as_scraped": 539, "date": "20170125210000", "story_content": "President Trump is set Wednesday to take the first steps toward building his \"big, beautiful wall\" to keep illegal immigrants out \u2013 but a more pressing issue may be dealing with the nearly 2 million criminal aliens who've already made it inside America's borders.\n\nAt least 925,000 illegal immigrants had been targeted for deportation but remained in the U.S., as of a 2015 estimate from Immigration and Custom Enforcement. A Department of Homeland Security study, however, said that number is more than doubled \u2013 to a staggering 1.9 million \u2013 when applied to all criminal aliens in the U.S., not just those ticketed to be kicked out. A criminal alien is any noncitizen \u2013 in the U.S. legally or illegally \u2013 convicted of a crime. But The Center for Immigration Studies' Jessica Vaughan has said the vast majority of those aliens are indeed illegals.\n\n\"It shows you how dysfunctional our interior immigration system is,\" Vaughan told Fox News.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTRUMP TO MAKE GOOD ON BORDER WALL PROMISE\n\nTrump began his candidacy by promising the mass deportation of illegals; however, as he emerged as the GOP nominee, and then eventually won the presidency, he softened his position to focus on criminal aliens.\n\nTrump's actions Wednesday will be the first step in that process. Among other orders, Trump is likely to curb funding to so-called sanctuary cities, beef up the number of border patrol agents and stop the controversial catch-and-release practice in which immigration agents release illegals awaiting removal hearings.\n\n\"They've been allowed to stay here and take advantage of our generous immigration court system,\" Vaughan said. \"But the result of letting people go instead of keeping them in custody is they disappear into the woodwork and don't fear any consequences.\"\n\nOf the 925,193 illegal immigrants who've evaded a scheduled deportation, 179,040 had a criminal conviction \u2013 and 172,135 of those remained at large, according to ICE figures.\n\nIn 2015 alone, 19,723 criminal illegal immigrants were released back into the U.S. \u2013 including 208 convicted of homicides and more than 900 with sex crime convictions, an ICE analysis showed. Those 19,723 illegals combined for a total of 64,197 convictions.\n\nTRUMP PROMISES MAJOR INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED VOTER FRAUD\n\n\"Judges are ordering people removed, but they are either skipping out on those orders or ICE is being told not to bother pursuing them because they're being told they should focus only on people who've committed very serious crimes,\" Vaughan said.\n\nAnd the numbers are trending upward. From 2012 to 2015, illegal immigrants set for deportation who remained in the U.S. grew by 20 percent.\n\n\"[Obama administration policies] contributed to this sense that our government isn't serious about enforcing immigration laws,\" Vaughan said. \"And that's why I think the executive orders coming today from President Trump are going to go a long way toward changing the calculation that illegal immigrants make \u2013 that they can just get away with ignoring a removal order.\"\n\nBut Vaughan cautioned that, despite Wednesday's flurry of presidential orders, the interior immigration issue is no quick fix.\n\n\"These people didn't arrive overnight and this problem didn't happen overnight, so it's going to take a few years to make a big dent in that number,\" Vaughan said. \"But today President Trump is getting the immigration enforcement system back on track.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 12, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.07692289352417, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 524, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.448481477740001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 16, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 7.06106870229008, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/09/castle-attack-exposes-jordan-vulnerability-to-is-threat.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [73]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 934, "scraper_regex": 985}}, "headline": "Castle attack exposes Jordan's vulnerability to IS threat", "wordcount_as_scraped": 985, "date": "20170109140000", "story_content": "KARAK, Jordan \u2013 \u00a0Bullet marks on the thick walls of a Crusader fortress and shattered windows of nearby tourist restaurants \u2014 damage from a recent shooting rampage \u2014 bear witness to Jordan's vulnerability to attacks by Islamic extremists.\n\nSome say the assault on Karak Castle by Jordanian followers of the Islamic State group could signal a more aggressive campaign to destabilize the pro-Western kingdom. A senior security official said the Karak attackers had planned multiple attacks in Jordan on New Year's Eve.\n\nThe government dismisses IS as a fringe phenomenon and says Jordan's security forces can contain any threat \u2014 but the Dec. 18 shooting set disconcerting precedents.\n\nIt marked the first time IS claimed an attack on a civilian site in Jordan, a spot popular with tourists. A Canadian woman and two local residents were among 10 people killed.\n\nThe four shooters were sons of Jordanian tribes, traditionally a pillar of support for the monarchy. Local media said they were college-educated men in their late 20s and early 30s, underscoring the appeal of IS ideology among some Jordanians.\n\nThe security establishment, meanwhile, faced rare criticism over its failure to prevent the attack, with more than one-third of parliament members calling for a vote of no-confidence in the interior minister.\n\nMarwan Shehadeh, an expert on militants, said the Karak shooting signaled \"a remarkable change\" in IS tactics. \"The year 2017 will be the year of great security challenges in Jordan,\" he said.\n\nGovernment spokesman Mohammed Momani said Jordan, a member of the U.S.-led military coalition against IS, is a target, but has countered threats because of social cohesion and what he said are well-trained security forces.\n\n\"We know we have been successful in stopping them on many other occasions,\" he said. \"If you look at what is happening in countries around us ... you see our ability to preserve our stability and security.\"\n\nJordan's confrontation with IS goes back to 2014, when the kingdom began carrying out air strikes as part of an international campaign to dislodge IS from neighboring Syria and Iraq where the militants captured large areas.\n\nBut Jordan's military strikes have not kept the militants from its borders, and have made the kingdom a target.\n\nLast year, seven IS supporters and a Jordanian officer were killed in a shootout during an arrest raid. In June, IS sent a car bomb from Syria that killed seven Jordanian troops. Lone gunmen carried out three separate attacks at Jordanian security installations, with five Americans among the dead. Jordanian officials have remained silent about the attackers' motives.\n\nAs IS comes under growing pressure in Syria and Iraq, a gradual retreat there might generate an even stronger incentive for the group to carry out mass attacks elsewhere to affirm its relevance.\n\nJordan is a logical target because of the visible presence of Western installations and foreigners, said David Schenker of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nThe U.S. is providing $1.6 billion in economic and military support to its beleaguered ally in 2017.\n\nStill, any U.S. concerns about Jordan may be overshadowed by the turmoil next door, said Schenker. \"The narrative here in Washington is that the threat is pretty large, but that Jordan can handle it,\" he said.\n\nJordan has clamped down on suspected IS sympathizers since 2014, with several hundred serving prison terms and five recently sentenced to death.\n\nAfter the Karak shooting, security forces detained dozens more people. Twenty-two hard-line preachers who refused to pray for the Karak victims will be punished, said Religious Affairs Minister Wael Arabiyat.\n\nCritics say Jordan fails to address the wider causes of the militants' appeal among Jordanians, hundreds of whom have been fighting in the ranks of IS in Iraq and Syria.\n\nMusleh Tarawneh, a Karak legislator who led the recent push in parliament to dismiss the interior minister, noted that unemployment in his district has risen to 25 percent and that university graduates can't find jobs. \"Islamic State found a way to enter the Jordanian tribes through poverty and unemployment,\" he said.\n\nThe rise in unemployment is a result of long-term trends that could take years to reverse, including an economic slump caused in part by regional instability. The Karak shooting dealt another setback to an already struggling tourism industry, once a vital sector of Jordan's economy.\n\nLast week, damage inflicted by the gunmen in Karak was still visible.\n\nGlass shards from a window shattered by gunfire covered the floor of the Shehab Restaurant at the castle gate. Linda Vatcher, a retired Canadian teacher, had stood in front of the restaurant when the white pickup carrying the four assailants screeched to a halt near her and assailants opened fire, killing her, said Jamal Saoub, a witness.\n\nAt nearby King's Castle restaurant, four tourists from France and Italy were eating lunch when the shots rang out, with at least two bullets piercing the glass door of the dining room, said waiter Abdel-Al Ibrahim, 52.\n\nThe attackers held off the security forces for hours, firing from slits in the castle walls before they were killed.\n\nThere has been speculation that the Karak cell targeted the castle spontaneously, after its hideout was discovered earlier that day. Atef al-Saoud, the head of the Public Security Directorate, said last week that the cell had planned to carry out New Year's Eve attacks with five explosives belts.\n\nIndividual tourists from the United States, Italy and Switzerland seemed undeterred, walking outside the castle last week, a day before it reopened.\n\nThey said they felt safe since the probability of a second attack in the same spot is low. They also said that attacks by militants can happen anywhere, pointing to recent incidents in Berlin and Istanbul.\n\nEmily Clymer, 31, a U.S. academic from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, said she feels safer in the Jordanian capital, Amman, where she works, than in the United States. Jordanian security forces \"take precautions, they react quickly,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nDaraghmeh reported from Ramallah, West Bank.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.94980716705322, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 934, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 21, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.7198976773000005, "HarmVirtue": 14, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 49, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170109140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.24625267665953, "mft_mean": 4.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/12/03/what-to-do-with-your-old-laptop.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a9": [4703]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 795, "scraper_regex": 835}}, "headline": "What to Do with Your Old Laptop", "wordcount_as_scraped": 835, "date": "20161203210000", "story_content": "If you've got a few outdated laptops collecting dust in your home, you're not alone. In a survey conducted last spring by the Consumer Reports National Research Center, more than half of the subscribers who purchased laptops since 2012 confessed to letting them linger under the roof long after they'd been replaced.\n\n\nAnd that raises a good question: How do you go about finding a new home for an old laptop? Here are a few options to consider.\n\n\nBelieve it or not, there's a robust market for old tech. Between eBay, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace, you should have no trouble finding someone to take an unwanted computer off your hands. Using eBay, I've sold a non-functioning MacBook Pro with a missing hard drive for $100, a three-year-old iPad mini for $175, and an iPhone for $200.\n\nOnline marketplaces make it really easy to list items, offering intuitive step-by-step instructions to help you sell your wares. And even though eBay takes a small cut of the sale price, I've found that it still yields a bigger sum than the buy-back sites such as Gazelle and Glyde.\n\nBefore you sell a digital device to someone you don't know, though, take a few precautions to protect your privacy. You don't want bank account info, personal images, or your browsing history lingering on the machine.\n\nWith a tablet, a factory reset (activated through the Settings menu) will wipe the slate clean. For a laptop, you're better off removing the hard drive. (Just be sure to note that it's gone when you place the item on sale.) The website ifixit.com offers teardowns tutorials to walk you through the process. The only tool you need is a screwdriver.\n\nIf your city does not sponsor a collection day for old electronic products, you can find a state-by-state listing of organizations that will accept them by going to the website TIA E-cycling Central. You should check out the collection programs at BestBuy and Staples, too. Both are free. And Amazon will reward you with a gift card for items recovered through its trade-in program.\n\nIt's always nice to give back\u2014especially during the holiday season\u2014and a used computer is a valuable tool to a family without the resources to buy one. If you'd like to contribute a laptop to a family in need, the National Cristina Foundation and the World Computer Exchange can help you make that happen.\n\n\"So many of our children today come home from school with homework that has to be done online,\" says Harry Rizer, CEO of the National Cristina Foundation. \"If the family doesn't have a computer, they have to take the kid to the library every night and stand in line until it's their turn. And if the library closes, they're out of luck.\"\n\nThat \"digital divide\" stretches way beyond childhood, too. These days, it's impossible to apply for a job at McDonald's without access to a computer and broadband.\n\nEven a 5- or 6-year-old computer can be given a \"second life\" in a new home, says Rizer. To locate a nearby nonprofit in need of equipment, you can check out the hundreds of pre-screened organizations listed on the National Cristina Foundation website.\n\nAnd, finally, if you have a child or a friend in need of a computer, you might consider giving the one you've outgrown a quick tuneup. If it was purchased in the last few years, you can make it run faster with a couple of tweaks.\n\nMacBooks are notoriously difficult to upgrade because their parts are usually soldered or glued into the body. But models made by other manufacturers let you add more memory and replace an old hard drive with a quicker, more efficient solid state drive (SSD). If that's too costly, lower-priced hybrid drives, which combine a hard drive with solid-state memory, represent a good compromise.\n\nOnce again, iFixit is a great resource for info on whether your device can be upgraded and how you go about doing it. A new SSD will give you the biggest performance boost, for example. It lets your computer access data without the moving parts required by a traditional hard drive and allows for quicker information retrieval.\n\nBut adding more memory (or RAM) can improve a computer's performance as well, allowing you to multitask with greater speed\u2014particularly if you're the sort who likes to keep a lot of tabs open on your browser. (Think 10 or more.)\n\nIf you don't plan to do video editing or heavy multitasking, 4 GB of RAM is probably enough. But desktops and laptops often have 8 GB. To find out what type of RAM modules your laptop needs, you might have to do a little digging. (Crucial and Kingston's online stores can help.) As for how much RAM your computer can handle, consult the owner's manual or the manufacturer's website.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2005-2016 Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.

His eagerness to resolve a 70-year-old territorial dispute that has kept their countries from signing a peace treaty formally ending World War II. A look at the two-day talks, which open at a hot springs resort in Abe's ancestral hometown of Nagato and wrap up Friday in Tokyo:\n\nTHE ISLANDS\n\nJapan says the Soviets took the southern Kuril islands illegally at the end of World War II, expelling 17,000 Japanese to nearby Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's four main islands. About one-third of the former residents are still alive. The Soviet Union, unilaterally scrapping a 1941 neutrality treaty, entered the war against Japan a week before the latter's surrender on Aug. 15, 1945. It occupied the disputed islands \u2014 known as the Northern Territories in Japan \u2014 within weeks, a process Russia says was legal. The two countries signed a Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration in 1956, ending their state of war and restoring diplomatic relations, but failed to conclude a peace treaty because of the island issue. Russia governs the islands and the Russians who live there.\n\n___\n\nPROSPECTS\n\nJapanese hopes for a settlement sank after Abe met Putin last month on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Peru. James Brown, a Russia-Japan expert at Temple University's Japan campus said \"there are too many obstacles to an agreement on the territorial issues to actually sign a peace treaty. I think they are trying to come up with some sort of formulation that gives the impression of progress.\" Former Japanese diplomat Kazuhiko Togo said in a recent commentary that serious negotiations began only after Abe and Putin met in Sochi, Russia, in May, \"and seven months is too short to untie this complicated knot.\"\n\n___\n\nECONOMY FIRST\n\nRussia wants to attract Japanese investment, particularly to its far east. Japan's trade minister in charge of Russia, Hiroshige Seko, said about 30 projects in eight areas are ready for signing: Japan would provide advanced medical, health and environmental technology and help with the industrialization of the far east, while receiving expertise from Russia in decommissioning nuclear plants, energy and cyber security. \"We will have a win-win situation, at least in economic relations,\" he told a news conference this week. Joint development of the disputed islands is also on the table, but Japan is wary of the sovereignty issue: If it's Japanese territory, shouldn't Japanese laws apply?\n\n___\n\nTHE LEADERS' WORDS\n\nAbe told a group of former residents of the islands this week that \"I'm determined to put an end to this issue in our generation.\" Putin told Japanese journalists Tuesday that there is a chance of a breakthrough, but his government doesn't mind the status quo. \"We think that we have no territorial problems. It's Japan that thinks that is has a territorial problem with Russia,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nA Russia-friendly approach from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could buy time, taking pressure off Japan to strike a quick deal before a change in U.S. leadership, said Alexander Gabuyev, a Carnegie Moscow Center expert on the Pacific region. Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, had been expected to take a tougher stance toward Moscow. At the same time Trump's \"America first\" policy has raised concern in Japan that any reduction of the U.S. military presence in Asia could mean increased risks for Japan as China's regional ambitions grow. Even short of a territorial agreement, Japan is keen to have closer relations with Russia for security reasons.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow and videojournalist Kaori Hitomi in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi\n\nFind her work at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/mari-yamaguchi\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nFormer diplomat Kazuhiko Togo: http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2016/12/10/can-japan-and-russia-achieve-a-genuine-rapprochement/\n\nTemple professor James Brown: http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2016/12/07/why-the-abe-putin-summit-is-likely-to-disappoint/\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.9178081750869798, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 625, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.8719327529099998, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.88, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/14/us-forces-may-have-committed-war-crimes-in-afghanistan-international-prosecutors-say.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [110]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 662, "scraper_regex": 766}}, "headline": "US forces may have committed war crimes in Afghanistan, international prosecutors say", "wordcount_as_scraped": 766, "date": "20161115020000", "story_content": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2013 \u00a0U.S. armed forces and the CIA may have committed war crimes by torturing detainees in Afghanistan, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor said in a report Monday, raising the possibility that American citizens could be indicted even though Washington has not joined the global court.\n\n\n\"Members of US armed forces appear to have subjected at least 61 detained persons to torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity on the territory of Afghanistan between 1 May 2003 and 31 December 2014,\" according to the report issued by Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's office.\n\nAMERICAN SOLDIERS KILLED IN SUICIDE BOMBING AT BAGRAM AIRFIELD IDENTIFIED\n\n\nThe report added that CIA operatives may have subjected at least 27 detainees in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania to \"torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity and/or rape\" between December 2002 and March 2008.\n\n\nMost of the alleged abuse happened in 2003-2004, the report said.\n\nJUDGE HEARS TESTIMONY ABOUT INJURIES DURING SEARCH FOR BOWE BERGDAHL\n\n\nProsecutors said they will decide \"imminently\" whether to seek authorization to open a full-scale investigation in Afghanistan that could lead to war crimes charges.\n\n\nState Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said the U.S. does not believe an ICC investigation is \"warranted or appropriate.\"\n\n\n\"The United States is deeply committed to complying with the law of war, and we have a robust national system of investigation and accountability that more than meets international standards,\" Trudeau said.\n\n\nA Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said officials were awaiting more details about the ICC findings before commenting.\n\n\nEstablished in 2002, the International Criminal Court is the world's first permanent court set up to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. More than 120 countries around the world are members, but superpowers including the United States, Russia and China have not signed up.\n\n\nFormer U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Rome treaty that established the court on Dec. 31, 2000, but President George W. Bush renounced the signature, citing fears that Americans would be unfairly prosecuted for political reasons.\n\n\nEven though the United States is not a member of the court, Americans could still face prosecution at its headquarters in The Hague if they commit crimes within its jurisdiction in a country that is a member, such as Afghanistan, and are not prosecuted at home.\n\n\nSo far, all of the ICC's trials have dealt with crimes committed in Africa.\n\n\nProsecutors say investigations also are reportedly under way in Poland, Romania and Lithuania -- all signatories to the Rome Statute -- into possible crimes at CIA detention facilities in those countries.\n\n\nThe abuse allegations came in a wide-ranging annual report into the prosecution office's so-called preliminary examinations, which involve studying reports of possible crimes to establish if they fall under the court's jurisdiction.\n\n\nThe same report said that Taliban and Afghan government forces also may have used torture and committed other atrocities in that country's long and bitter conflict. The report says that the Taliban and its affiliates killed thousands of people and are suspected of committing war crimes including murder, recruiting and conscripting child soldiers and attacking civilians and humanitarian workers.\n\n\nReferring to the alleged U.S. war crimes, the report said they \"were not the abuses of a few isolated individuals. Rather, they appear to have been committed as part of approved interrogation techniques in an attempt to extract `actionable intelligence' from detainees.\"\n\n\nThe report adds that, \"The information available suggests that victims were deliberately subjected to physical and psychological violence, and that crimes were allegedly committed with particular cruelty and in a manner that debased the basic human dignity of the victims.\"\n\n\nBefore deciding to open a full-scale investigation, ICC prosecutors have to establish whether they have jurisdiction and whether the alleged crimes are being investigated and prosecuted in the countries involved. The ICC is a court of last resort that takes on cases only when other countries are unable or unwilling to prosecute.\n\n\nThe report noted that U.S. authorities have conducted dozens of investigations and court-martial cases and says ICC prosecutors are seeking further clarifications on their scope before deciding whether any American cases would be admissible at the ICC.\n\n\nAfter the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the administration of President George W. Bush allowed the use of waterboarding, which simulates drowning, and other so-called enhanced interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists. President Barack Obama banned such practices after taking office in 2009.\n\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Republican nominee Donald Trump suggested that as president he would push to change laws that prohibit waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques, arguing that banning them puts the U.S. at a strategic disadvantage against ISIS militants.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -11.051213264465302, "HarmVice": 16, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 662, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.55453638177, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161115020000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.77643504531722, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/01/full-filth-and-hope-calais-migrant-camp-is-no-more.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [71]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1204, "scraper_regex": 1281}}, "headline": "Full of filth and hope, Calais migrant camp is no more", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1281, "date": "20161101170000", "story_content": "CALAIS, France \u2013 \u00a0A slum camp built by migrants on France's northern shore, harboring unfathomable hope and humanity mixed with filth and fear, is now a puddled moonscape of dirt and sand dunes.\n\nBulldozers and cleaning crews are erasing the final traces of the vast makeshift camp in Calais, known to all as \"the jungle.\" As an autumn wind blew in from the English Channel, the last of its homemade shelters disappeared Monday night, the end of a weeklong, programmed mass evacuation that spiraled toward a chaotic end as departing migrants set fires to swaths of the site.\n\n\"It has been evacuated. It will be secured. No one will be able to go there again,\" President Francois Hollande said in an interview published Tuesday in La Voix du Nord newspaper, determined to ensure the definitive demise of a camp that mushroomed into a symbol of Europe's migrant crisis after the first arrivals staked out plots in the sandy earth 18 months ago.\n\nThe complex exit operation included the transfer of thousands of migrants to reception centers scattered around France \u2014 abandoned holiday resorts, unused municipal buildings and other sites in towns and villages with mixed feelings about taking in homeless foreigners. There, people will have a chance to apply for asylum, and also face the risk of getting deported.\n\nBut the end of \"the jungle\" \u2014 which aid groups said held more than 10,000 inhabitants two months ago \u2014 leaves unfinished business, such as the uncertain fate of more than 1,500 minors who came to France alone. The camp's closure also upended dreams of the majority of migrants who came to Calais for what they hoped would be a brief stop on the way to Britain.\n\nThe unofficial camp took in \u2014 no questions asked \u2014 people fleeing wars, dictatorships or grinding poverty. Among its residents: Pepsi, a transgender Filipino who had worked in Libya; a deaf Sudanese who built a fanciful house decorated with whirly-gigs, flags and ornamental Christmas trees; an Afghan diagnosed with PTSD.\n\n\"I don't want to be nostalgic, as this was not a place to live,\" Francois Guennoc, vice president of aid group Auberge des Migrants, said. Yet \"amazing things happened in this slum,\" Guennoc added, noting how migrants built restaurants, shops, schools, mosques and a church while demonstrating the capacity communities of different origins have to live together.\n\n\"There were stories of friendship, even love,\" amid fierce fights, he said. \"Life was intense.\"\n\nThe intense life and quick death of the jungle camp left some migrants relieved to find an alternative, others deeply upset.\n\nMahmet Khan, an 18-year-old Afghan, was left panicking as the deadline to evacuate neared last week. He said he had spent 14 months in the camp, arriving as a minor who could not be expelled from France and getting evicted as an adult whose weeks in the country may be numbered.\n\n\"We paid 8,000 euros for me to come to Europe,\" Khan, a slight boy-man, moaned. \"My mother sell her house. Mother says, 'You go, save your life in UK.'\"\n\nSpeaking amid the rubble of the improvised restaurant where minors found meals and companionship, Khan felt lost as he watched the buses pulling out. He worked seven months as a volunteer cook at the Kids Restaurant after futilely trying to jump onto trucks that could carry him across the Channel.\n\n\"Look at my face. Shit!\" he said, visibly anguished. \"I so tired ... I so upset, confused. No family, no friends. No life ... All is crazy.\"\n\nThe shanty town settlement was emblematic of France's early failure to address the surge of desperate people making their way to the country in what has become an ongoing exodus from Africa and the Middle East, a microcosm of challenges playing out elsewhere in Europe as humanitarian impulses go toe-to-toe with fear, tension and hate.\n\nAnti-migrant sentiment emerged around Calais as merchants and some citizens complained the camp had blackened the image of their city, where barbed-wire fences were erected to prevent migrants from accessing roads to the port and the Eurotunnel. Some died on the roadways, mainly in hit-and-run accidents in their dangerous gamble to sneak into moving trucks.\n\nRiot police were an ever-present nightmare for migrants. More than 2,000 were brought into Calais, posted at the camp entrance, occasionally patrolling inside and nightly spraying those on the roadway leading to the port with tear gas.\n\nThe alleys of the jungle could be mean. Thefts, fights and fires were not uncommon. Disputes among communities occasionally ended with shelters set ablaze. One Afghan migrant lifted his shirt to show scars from wounds stitched up after a knife attack, and produced medical records.\n\nStarting in the 1990s \u2014 long before Europe's current migrant crisis \u2014 refugees from the war in Kosovo, the killing fields of Afghanistan and Sudan or closed-off countries like Eritrea were massing in Calais, dreaming of Britain. Syrians followed.\n\nA 2003 deal cut by Paris and London, which followed the closing of a huge Red Cross camp in nearby Sangatte, effectively puts the British border in Calais \u2014 and the onus on France to keep migrants from entering Britain. The British government in turn has pumped millions into security structures in Calais.\n\nBut migrants stuck to their dreams, living first in \"mini-jungles\" within groves of trees, behind a grocery store or in the shadow of the Tioxide chemical plant.\n\nThey had made perilous journeys before reaching Calais, overland through Europe or across the Mediterranean from Libya. In many cases, they witnessed the deaths of fellow travelers on the way. The city repeatedly bulldozed groupings of shelters that sprouted up.\n\nThen an official center opened on the edge of town for 400 women and children in April 2015, with showers and cellphone chargers that drew in other migrants, too. Word got out, and migrants began sinking roots around the unstable sand dunes. Officials closed their eyes to the new \"jungle\" in the making, and it grew, and grew.\n\nAuthorities razed the southern half of the camp in March, pushing 1,000 migrants out. The displaced squeezed into the northern half, and migrants kept coming.\n\nAnd now the northern half is empty, too. The migrants are gone, along with the businesses that helped them survive.\n\nTasty Land, White Mountain and the Kids Restaurant were reduced to charred rubble in blazes last week and swept into dump trucks. The cleanup took away thousands of tents and huts that blanketed the sand, along with slightly more substantial plywood dwellings decorated with tiger pictures or hand-painted flowers.\n\nIts several schools were mowed down. The Ethiopian-built Orthodox church, adorned with Madonnas and angels, its two crosses soaring above the camp, remains standing for now, along with other places of worship. They, too, are destined to go.\n\n\"We lived in the jungle like a family. We knew each other, we helped each other and suddenly everyone needs to go,\" said Jamal Ismail, a British-Malaysian who ran the Kitchen in Calais, a volunteer service that provided 1,500 meals a day.\n\nThe kitchen, built of plywood, survived the fires, but not the bulldozer. Ismail didn't grieve.\n\n\"There is no foundation on sand ... It would not last 100 years,\" he said. \"And people needed to move on. There is no future in the jungle.\"\n\nAuthorities vow to ensure the camp does not rise up again. Police are systematically checking potential squatting sites around town. Mayors in neighboring towns are doing the same.\n\nGuennoc, of the Auberge des Migrants aid group, criticized the exit plan for failing to take into account migrants who don't qualify for asylum but can offer Europe their remarkable energy and ingenuity.\n\nThe slum camp \"could have become a city. Only a police headquarters and a mayor's office were missing,\" he mused.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.686260223388669, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1204, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.4593268346300006, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161101170000, "PurityVirtue": 4, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.90697674418605, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/24/philippines-braces-for-christmas-storm-offers-roasted-pigs.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [81]}}, "headline": "Philippines braces for Christmas storm, offers roasted pigs", "wordcount_as_scraped": 530, "date": "20161225060000", "story_content": "MANILA, Philippines \u2013 \u00a0A powerful typhoon is on its way to slam into the eastern Philippines on Christmas Day as officials struggled to divert people's attention from family celebrations and travel. A provincial governor offered roasted pigs to entice villagers to move to emergency shelters.\n\nTyphoon Nock-Ten packed sustained winds of 175 kilometers (108 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 215 kph (133 mph), and was expected to smash into the island province of Catanduanes Sunday night. It's then forecast to blow across the southern portion of the main Luzon island and pass close to the capital, Manila, on Monday, before exiting into the South China Sea. Nock-Ten may weaken after landfall and hitting the Sierra Madre mountain range in southern Luzon.\n\nHeavy rainfall, destructive winds and battering waves were threatening heavily populated rural and urban regions, where the Philippine weather agency raised typhoon warnings. Officials warned of storm surges in coastal villages, flash floods and landslides and asked villagers to evacuate to safer grounds.\n\nBut Christmas is the biggest holiday in the country, Asia's bastion of Catholicism, giving officials a hard time getting people's attention away from the holidays to heed the warnings.\n\nIn the past 65 years, seven typhoons have struck the Philippines on Christmas Day, according to the government's weather agency.\n\nGov. Miguel Villafuerte of Camarines Sur, which is on the typhoon's forecast path, offered roast pigs, a popular Christmas delicacy locally called \"lechon,\" in evacuation centers to entice villagers to move away from high-risk communities.\n\n\"I know it's Christmas ... but this is a legit typhoon,\" Villafuerte tweeted on Christmas Eve. \"Please evacuate, we'll be having lechon at evacuation centers.\"\n\nCamarines Sur officials targeted about 50,000 families \u2014 some 250,000 people \u2014 for evacuation by Saturday night, but the number of those who responded was far below expectations.\n\nThe Department of Social Welfare and Development, which helps oversee government response during disasters, said only about 4,200 people have moved to six evacuation centers by Sunday morning in the Bicol region that includes Camarines Sur.\n\n\"It's difficult to force celebrations when our lives will be put at risk. Please prioritize safety and take heed of warnings by local government units,\" welfare official Felino Castro told The Associated Press by telephone.\n\nHe said food, water and other emergency supplies had been pre-positioned in areas expected to be lashed by the typhoon, but his department was to hold an emergency meeting with the military, coast guard and other agencies Sunday to discuss disaster-response plans.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms, mostly from the Pacific, lash the Philippine archipelago each year and provincial governments have long laid down a contingency system to launch war-like logistical preparations each time a major typhoon approaches.\n\nBut in an impoverished nation of more than 100 million people, where many live near the coast and on and around mountains and volcanoes, deadly natural catastrophes are a part of life in one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world.\n\nIn November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan struck the central Philippines with ferocious power, leaving more than 7,300 people dead and missing and displacing more than 5 million others after leveling entire villages despite days of dire warnings by government officials.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.32525968551636, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 505, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.3545149478, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161225060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.58415841584158, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/01/19/person-to-person-contact-may-cause-most-drug-resistant-tb-cases.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Person-to-person contact may cause most drug-resistant TB cases", "wordcount_as_scraped": 660, "date": "20170119150000", "story_content": "The worst form of drug-resistant tuberculosis isn't just arising from inadequate treatment, it's mostly being spread from person to person, according to a new study of hundreds of cases in South Africa that has important implications for how the deadly disease is treated.\n\nResearchers tracked TB that is resistant to at least four key drugs and found that 69 percent of the victims had never received treatment, an indication that they had acquired it from others with extensively drug-resistant TB.\n\nTB develops resistance to drugs when it is attacked with lackluster therapy, allowing the slow-growing bacterium to become insensitive to well-established therapies. Strains that are simultaneously resistant to at least four drugs have been reported in 105 countries.\n\n\"For many years, there was this thought that maybe drug-resistant TB strains might not be able to be transmitted as efficiently a regular TB strains,\" coauthor Dr.. Neel R. Gandhi of Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta told Reuters Health by phone.\n\nThe results published in the New England Journal of Medicine \"turn this idea on its head,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Atlanta who was not involved in the research.\n\nThe study team's estimate that two thirds of the cases are surfacing because the disease is spreading by person-to-person contact \"is mostly likely a minimum estimate,\" Gandhi said.\n\n\"This is an epidemic we've known about for 10 years and we don't seem to be making a dent in it,\" he said. \"And that may be because the driver isn't what we thought it was.\"\n\n\"It raises the possibility of turning the clock back to the 1930s and 1940s\" and requiring infected people to live in sanitariums so patients can't inadvertently spread the disease, Schaffner said. \"You also have to do better at diagnosing them earlier. We're going to have to be a lot more aggressive in finding the infected people early. These are substantial public health challenges.\"\n\nDrug resistance has gotten so bad, the rate of successful treatment can be less than 40 percent if a person acquires an extensively drug-resistant strain. It can be particularly deadly in people who also harbor HIV, the AIDS virus. In South Africa, where the new study was done, there has been a 10-fold increase in the number of extensively drug-resistant cases in the past decade. One in 36,000 are now infected.\n\nThe team of researchers used contact tracing to find where the TB patients were spending at least two hours per week, trying to uncover any links.\n\nThey found 31 clusters of the disease, the largest of which accounted for 84 percent of the 404 patients they studied.\n\nLiving with someone with TB accounted for most of the acquired cases, although the disease was also spread in the workplace (representing 13 percent of cases) or in other community settings such as a church, bar, beauty salon or prison (accounting for 8 percent of cases).\n\n\"Certain networks spanned multiple homes, family generations, and community settings,\" the study team writes.\n\nComplicating control is that people can be infectious before they know they have drug-resistant TB.\n\n\"We know people transmit (the disease) for weeks or months before they come for a diagnosis,\" said Gandi, an associate professor of epidemiology, global health and infectious diseases at Emory.\n\n\"You have to focus on stopping the chain of transmission,\" he said. \"You have to identify early and intervene early. When you diagnose, drug susceptibility should be part of that diagnosis. And we have to do a better job creating facilities where transmission doesn't take place, particularly in healthcare settings, hospitals, homeless shelters in the United States and in schools and workplaces.\"\n\nThe other researchers involved in the study were from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, the province of 10.3 million people where the study was done.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.0902681350708, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 640, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 9, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.60324019332, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170119150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8125, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/12/crash-church-preaches-word-god-in-sao-paulo-to-heavy-metal-rhythms.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [89]}}, "headline": "Crash Church preaches word of God in Sao Paulo to heavy metal rhythms", "wordcount_as_scraped": 531, "date": "20170112210000", "story_content": "SAO PAULO, Brazil \u2013 \u00a0Inside a Sao Paulo garage the first chords of a heavy metal song blast out and the lyrics speak of Jesus Christ and salvation.

His grayish beard is fashioned into a braid about 1.5 inches long.\n\nBesides being a pastor, Batista is the lead singer in the Christian death metal band known as Antidemon and one of the founders of this \"unconventional\" church created in 1998 out of what he says was a \"divine need.\"\n\n\"This is part of God's plan to cross barriers, which had a very closed-off format and were unable to reach many aspects of society,\" says Batista, referring to other more conservative religious currents, including the powerful Universal Church of the Kingdom of God and the Assembly of God.\n\nMaria Aparecida Castellini, 54, has seven children and three of them belong to traditional evangelical churches that don't \"tolerate\" members adopting \"punk\" fashions such as dying one's hair green, painting fingernails and lips electric blue and wearing torn clothing that exposes portions of their skin.\n\nShe says she is \"crazy\" for Jesus and rock, but her previous church - Reborn in Christ - \"told me that rock was a sin, a thing of the devil,\" adding that she walks two hours to attend the Crash Church.\n\nBehind a medieval-looking pulpit, Batista reads from the Gospel, while the congregation follows along on their cellphones, in regular Bibles or on the TV screens that show the biblical passages being discussed.\n\nBatista uses everyday jargon to explain the word of God and intersperses his sermons with rock songs that, despite their intensity, don't bother two babies sleeping in their mothers' arms just a few feet away or the octogenarian women listening impassively to the loud music.\n\nIn one of his sermons, the pastor compares the story of Jesus with that of the congregation members, noting that despite the prejudice that existed (and exists) against them, they are all still \"of God.\"\n\n\"The people awaited ... a powerful messiah. Nobody expected a church like ours. They're not expecting us to be people of God, but we are of God,\" he says.\n\nHe says that churches like Crash Church have contributed to the expansion of evangelical religion, which - in contrast to Catholicism - has gained ground in recent years in Brazil.\n\nIn 1994, 75 percent of Brazilians declared themselves to be Catholic, but that percentage has dropped to 50 percent now, while evangelical Protestants have increased to comprise 29 percent of the population.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.76056337356567, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 511, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.11222595793, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 11, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170112210000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.9354207436399196, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/03/judge-napolitano-fbi-director-james-comey-has-behaved-like-j-edgar-hoover.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [5781]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 937, "scraper_regex": 988}}, "headline": "Judge Napolitano: FBI Director James Comey has behaved like J. Edgar Hoover", "wordcount_as_scraped": 988, "date": "20161103050000", "story_content": "I had intended to use this final column before the presidential election to explain at length why I cannot vote for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump and plan to vote for Gary Johnson for president. In a nutshell, big government is our biggest problem. It thrives on more debt, more taxes, more regulations, more war, a secretive deep state and less personal freedom. Both Clinton and Trump would grow the government. Only Johnson would shrink it.\n\nOne of the most dangerous tendencies of big government is the generation of a police state -- wherein laws, rules and procedures are primarily written and can often be bent to aid law enforcement when it is encroaching on our personal freedoms. We saw a terrifying example of that last week when FBI Director James Comey behaved as if he were his most infamous predecessor, J. Edgar Hoover.\n\nHere is the back story.\n\nLate last week, in an effort to redeem himself from the consequences of having ignored a mountain of evidence of guilt against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last summer, Comey told Congress in a cryptic letter that the FBI would resume investigating her emails based upon the belief that more of them may be located in the laptop of disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner. Weiner is the alleged sexual predator who remains the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clinton's closest aides. Abedin backed up all her emails onto the laptop that she and her husband shared.\n\nAt the time he sent his Friday letter, Comey had not yet seen the contents of the Weiner laptop because the search warrant authorizing FBI agents to access its contents was not signed until Sunday. If he saw something incriminating before he wrote his letter, he saw it unlawfully; yet his duty was to bring what he saw to the Department of Justice, for which he works, not to hint about it publicly to Congress.\n\nComey's progress report to Congress is prohibited by the internal regulations of the DOJ and the FBI -- and by the canons of legal ethics that regulate lawyers. Comey had no obligation to send the letter at any time; moreover, sending it last week was a direct violation of DOJ and FBI rules that prohibit all public announcements about candidates for public office within 60 days of Election Day.\n\nComey told FBI staffers early this week that he sent the letter because he felt duty-bound to members of a congressional committee to whom he had given a promise that he would keep them informed of the status of the email investigation. That was a troublesome promise because its compliance violated other duties imposed upon Comey. Worse than making a promise and not keeping it is making a promise that should not be kept.\n\nThe genesis of all this was Comey's unprecedented news conference on July 5, at which he announced that no charges would be filed against Clinton because no prosecutor would take the case. That was not an announcement for him to make. The FBI's job is to gather facts and present them to the DOJ, not to make legal evaluations. He made his announcement when he did to head off the behavior of some of his agents who were seeking Clinton's medical records, unlawfully, from the National Security Agency to ascertain the gravity of her head injury -- an injury she posited during her FBI interrogation as the reason for her professed memory loss.\n\nI have argued that Comey's July 5 decision was dead wrong; there is a mountain of evidence with which to indict and convict Clinton on espionage charges. Yet it should have been presented to a grand jury -- it was not -- rather than at a news conference. The July 5 announcement was bizarre in that it not only exonerated Clinton but also described the quantity and quality of the evidence against her. This insulted the agents who worked on the case and produced the lowest collective FBI morale since Watergate. If Comey sent his Friday letter to address the problems he caused by his July 5 announcement, he did the wrong thing for the wrong reasons.\n\nBut perhaps the gravest of Comey's violations is that of the constitutional guarantee of due process. The essence of due process is notice and fairness. How exquisitely unfair of Comey to say, in effect, \"We have something that warrants investigation of you, yet we don't know its significance, so we can't say what it is.\" This is reminiscent of Franz Kafka's \"The Trial,\" in which the lead character is being pursued for a year on unnamed charges, against which he cannot defend himself.\n\nIn his play \"A Man for All Seasons,\" Robert Bolt shows Sir Thomas More arguing with William Roper, a colleague, who suggests that government lawbreaking can be justified for the greater good, particularly if the target is the devil (which Trump has called Clinton). More demolishes that argument in a few now iconic lines: \"And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you -- where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast -- man's laws, not God's -- and if you cut them down, and you're just the man to do it, d'you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.\"\n\nTo my friends who have rejoiced in James Comey's letter, please take warning that, as More accurately predicted, the tables can be turned. If there is any moral lesson in all this, it is that the history of human freedom consists of paying careful attention to constitutional guarantees and legal protections, no matter the reputation of the accused.\n\n\n\nAndrew P.

The IMC's assault on ISIS into the eastern side of Mosul began on October 17, 2016. As reported by several media sources, it was restarted on December 29 after a month-long IMC \"operational pause.\"\n\nEXCLUSIVE VIDEO: PESHMERGA SOLDIERS IN BRUTAL FIREFIGHT VS. ISIS\n\nAs previously reported, the IMC has approximately 80,000 troops encircling Mosul that are fighting against approximately 8,000 entrenched ISIS radical Islamic terrorists. By various media accounts, 500,000+ Mosul civilians (largely of the Sunni Muslim sect) are trapped inside Mosul as \"slave labor and human shields\" for the ISIS terrorists.\n\nThe US military contribution to the IMC numbers about 6,000 troops. The US contingent, with an \"advise and assist\" mission, is called Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR). Lt. General Stephen Townsend commands OIR. An additional 550 US Special Operations Forces are operating in ISIS-held territory in the neighboring country of Syria.\n\nDEVASTATED BY MILITANTS, 3,000-YEAR-OLD CITY LEFT TO LOOTERS\n\nCurrently, the US forces operating in Iraq and Syria have suffered just three KIAs (killed in action). The IMC doesn't publicly report its casualties; however, independent on-the-ground United Nations officials calculate that the IMC has suffered just over 2,000 KIA.\n\nDuring this IMC operational pause, Iraqi Prime Minister Abadi and US Defense Secretary Ash Carter traveled to the front lines of the fight for Mosul to meet with the IMC generals. Apparently, the discussion involved options for the IMC to markedly increase their slow progress in gaining control of Mosul from ISIS. Other key considerations are to reduce significant IMC casualties and to drastically reduce the effectiveness of ISIS' deadly asymmetric tactics.\n\nIt appears, from multiple media reports and the West Point Counter-Terrorism Center, that the IMC is now employing a much more aggressive approach with pre-assault artillery bombardments prior to IMC's tactical attacks. This aggressive fire support is a calculated risk for the IMC considering the heavy presence of Mosul civilians in and near the combat areas.\n\nThis article will focus on the macro-view of strategic and operational levels of the psychological dimensions of the Mosul fight. OpsLens will provide more details and a deeper tactical analysis\u2014on both the ISIS and IMC sides\u2014in the coming days.\n\nIMC's dilemma in balancing its assaulting forces' casualties versus the civilians' casualties is a tough decision. ISIS will probably continue its use of Mosul civilians as human shields. As IMC employs much more fire support to its leading units entering Mosul, this will likely result in higher ISIS and civilian casualties. Higher civilian casualties will yield much more intensified scrutiny from international observers and the media. Although the decision may appear to be uncaring toward the Mosul civilians, it is understandable from a \"strategic mission perspective.\"\n\nWhen analyzing this IMC decision from the macro-view, several positive factors and trade-offs are evident: the overall positive impact of recapturing Mosul vis-\u00e0-vis the mission to defeat the brutal ISIS organization, degrading the prestige and recruiting successes of ISIS by defeating ISIS in Mosul, freeing the Mosul residents from oppression and slavery, and stopping the massive genocide of Christians, Yazidis, and other minority religions and their respective religious artifacts, among others.\n\nThe IMC, now fully engaged in the Mosul fight against ISIS, has no option except winning. Recapturing Mosul would be a major strategic defeat for ISIS. If the IMC loses this Mosul battle (or it ends in a stalemate), that would be an even bigger psychological defeat for the IMC. A defeat for the IMC has enormous negative consequences for the overarching anti-ISIS global coalition-building, and flowing from that, the ultimate defeat of ISIS.\n\nThe major task for the IMC is to be bolder and more aggressive in attacking ISIS in Mosul while keeping civilian casualties relatively low. This balancing aspect of the aggressive fight is pivotal to overall success. And ISIS will complicate this IMC balancing act with hostile and false propaganda to undermine the IMC's credibility and will to fight.\n\nMike Furlong is a Senior OpsLens Contributor, career Army Infantry Officer, Battalion Task Force Commander, Combat Veteran, and Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service, Retired.\n\nClick for more from OpsLens.com\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.23409652709961, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 662, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 13, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.64544321014, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170109220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8700906344410897, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/11/trump-vows-no-wrecking-ball-to-obama-legacy-but-signals-big-changes.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [528, 560, 1309, 1499, 1556, 1602, 2457, 2473, 2499, 2951, 2974, 3008, 3066, 3126, 4233, 5245]}}, "headline": "Trump vows no \u2018wrecking ball\u2019 to Obama legacy \u2013 but signals big changes", "wordcount_as_scraped": 867, "date": "20161211200000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump left the door open Sunday on how exactly he plans to overhaul the regulation-heavy agenda pursued by the Obama administration, suggesting he wouldn't dismantle all that his predecessor has done \u2013 while making clear the government needs to be more business-friendly.\n\nAsked in an exclusive interview with \"Fox News Sunday\" whether he'd take a \"wrecking ball\" to President Obama's legacy, the construction magnate responded:\n\n\"No.\u00a0I don't want to do that at all.\u00a0I just want what's right.\"\n\nThe answer may have surprised those watching Trump's recent Cabinet selections, which have included: a prominent ObamaCare critic to lead the Health and Human Services Department; a foe of Obama's overtime pay expansion to lead the Labor Department; and a state attorney general currently suing the Environmental Protection Agency to lead that very agency.\n\nTrump, at the same time, has sent mixed signals about his plans, meeting in recent days with prominent climate change activists Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nAsked on \"Fox News Sunday\" about the implications of those meetings as well as his Cabinet selections, Trump indicated his interest is in making the government more efficient and responsive to business.\u00a0\n\nTRUMP RIPS CLAIMS OF RUSSIA INTERFERENCE IN 2016 RACE\n\nAt the EPA, he said, \"You can't get things approved.

I do know this:\u00a0other countries are eating our lunch.\"\n\nTaken together, Trump's comments, meetings and appointments speak to an incoming president still weighing his options on how drastically he wants to reverse or halt the Obama regulatory agenda.\n\nIn an indication that the incoming administration may be preparing for big changes with regard to energy sector programs and rules, his transition team reportedly has sent around a questionnaire asking the Energy Department for a list of appointees and senior executives \u2013 and details on who has spearheaded the agency's clean energy initiatives.\n\nOne unnamed department official described the questionnaire as a hit list, according to an Associated Press report. The memo sparked alarm among some Democrats, as did Trump's decision last week to name Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA.\n\nPruitt has been involved in lawsuits against the Obama EPA, including over the controversial Clean Power Plan and waterway regulations. He also has suggested the debate over global warming \u2013 and the impact of human activity on global temperatures \u2013 is unsettled. \u00a0\n\nFormer Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders suggested Sunday that the Pruitt pick suggests the meetings with Gore and others are not informing policy decisions.\n\n\"I'm glad they reached out to Gore, but apparently they are not hearing what Gore has to say,\" he told CBS News' \"Face the Nation.\" Sanders said it's troubling Trump would appoint a climate change \"denier\" to lead the EPA.\n\nTrump's first order of Obama legacy business may be the Affordable Care Act, with congressional Republicans eager to send a repeal bill to his desk next year. Trump has said he plans to nominate Georgia Rep. Tom Price to lead HHS, which would put an outspoken ObamaCare critic at the helm of the agency that implemented the law.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that the Obama administration \"pushed investment out\" with its raft of rules and predicted a shift toward what he called \"common-sense regulation,\" including with health care. \u00a0\n\n\"Our No. 1 focus is jobs [in the House],\" he said. \"[ObamaCare] is going to collapse on itself.

This is what we get,\" he said against a backdrop of bombed-out buildings and thousands of people waiting for buses to take them away from Aleppo.\n\nBut even in his first hours of exile, the 28-year-old nurse longed to return.\n\n\"My soul is torn out more with each step away from Aleppo,\" he whispered in an audio message to The Associated Press, not wanting to wake other evacuees in their temporary home in a village west of the ancient city.\n\nHe and thousands of others held tight to their crumbling enclave despite a grueling four years of war. Bit by bit over three weeks, the government offensive chipped away at their last refuge.\n\nTheir realm of destroyed buildings and crater-filled roads in eastern Aleppo shrank from 17 square miles to just one over a few weeks as forces loyal to President Bashar Assad swept through, neighborhood by neighborhood.\n\nThe promise of boarding buses to safety was a relief. But for many like Shekho, losing Aleppo was inconceivable.\n\nOf the more than half-dozen residents and activists that AP has maintained regular contact with in recent months, only one said he felt disillusioned with the rebellion.\n\n\"This revolution is one of the biggest failures in the world,\" said 21-year-old Ahmed, who has not left the enclave yet and refused to give his family name out of fear of reprisal. \"If God saves me from this, I will go to Turkey and start a new life, away from the criminal regime and the deceiving rebels.\"\n\nMost seemed haunted by the city's struggle, saying they can't let go of their dream to create a Syria without Assad. They said they will continue their anti-government activities somehow from wherever they end up.\n\nOne gynecologist who had refused to leave her patients said her husband forced her to flee to a government-controlled area for safety.\n\nThe woman, who identified herself only as Farida to protect her family, earlier had sent her daughter out with thousands of other evacuees.\n\nFarida said she could not stand living for even two days in the government-controlled sector and fled to the countryside, where the rebels are in control.\n\n\"Despite how hard it was under siege and bombardment, I was at peace with myself,\" she said.\n\nFarida's husband, also a doctor, followed. But she is still angry at him for forcing her to leave, adding: \"I can't continue my life with him.\"\n\n\"I can't feel any joy when my colleagues are getting slaughtered,\" she said in text messages. She hopes to be reunited one day with her daughter.\n\nShekho left on the first day of the evacuation, which was monitored by the Red Cross. He and thousands of other holdouts boarded green government buses with portraits of Assad in the windshield and were taken to rebel-controlled areas.\n\n\"It is very painful that I separate from my city of 28 years,\" Shekho said. \"I hope it is quickly liberated so I can return to it.\"\n\nBesides seeing his city crumble, Shekho watched his family shattered by more than five years of civil war.\n\nOn the first day of the government's big ground offensive three weeks ago, Shekho and his family sought a new home to avoid intense bombing.\n\nLike many others, his family was caught on the road by the bombardment, and his brother was killed on the spot.\n\nHe and his father had to search for a cemetery because Aleppo was running out of a href='https://apnews.com/7b187a9289f14996b2299dceb14d9c13/No-more-room-for-the-dead-as-Syria's-Aleppo-is-crushed'burial space/a . In the process, his father \u2014 a prominent professor of Arabic \u2014 also was killed.\n\nFour years earlier, an airstrike killed his sister outside the hospital where she worked as a nurse.\n\nAfter mourning his father and brother, Shekho had told the AP: \"We are all on the road to death. May God accept them as martyrs.\"\n\nBefore he boarded the bus, he roamed the few streets of Aleppo still open to him for one last time \u2014 but he couldn't visit the graves of his relatives because the government had seized the neighborhood where they are buried.\n\n\"I hope they forgive us\" for losing Aleppo, Shekho said.\n\nHe said he plans to be reunited with his wife, who left as the fighting intensified, and also wants to see his English teachers again.\n\nMost likely, he will settle in a town on the Orontes River in Idlib province where rebels are in control.\n\nMany predict that Idlib may be the next front in a government offensive.\n\nAsked what he expected in his new life, he said: \"It is the unknown future filled with painful memories.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.29834270477295, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 796, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.8919952219200002, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161217120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.1457286432160805, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/19/crib-ads-often-show-babies-in-unsafe-sleep-settings.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Crib ads often show babies in unsafe sleep settings", "wordcount_as_scraped": 653, "date": "20161219210000", "story_content": "Ads for cribs often show infants asleep on their stomachs or surrounded by suffocation hazards like soft toys and blankets - all of which can increase babies' risk of sleep-related deaths - a U.S. study suggests. \n\n\"The impact of these advertisements is one factor that continues to result in the use of bumper pads and stuffed animals in children's cribs,\" said senior study author Dr. Bradley Troxler of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \n\n\"Parents are exposed to exponentially more advertisements about baby gear, furniture, and cribs when compared to the amount of time spent face to face with their child's physician,\" Troxler said in an email. \n\nSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has become much less common in recent decades as doctors have urged parents to put infants to sleep on their backs without pillows or other soft bedding and toys that could pose a suffocation risk. But it still remains a leading cause of infant mortality. \n\nIn the U.S. alone, SIDS kills about four babies out of every 10,000 live births, down from about 130 in 10,000 in 1990, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n\nDespite the dramatic decline in death from SIDS since 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) announced that babies should be placed on their backs to sleep, many parents still fail to consistently follow safe sleep practices. \n\nTo prevent SIDS and other sleep-related deaths, the AAP encourages breastfeeding, pacifier use and firm crib mattresses and cautions against blankets, pillows, crib bumpers, soft toys and bed-sharing. \n\nFor the current study, researchers analyzed 1,758 magazine ads from 1992, 2010 and 2015. \n\nThey found 35 percent of current advertisements for babies failed to follow safe sleep recommendations. \n\nThere have been some improvements. \n\nFor example, 57 percent of babies were shown sleeping on their stomachs in ads from the early 1990s - a position that increases the risk of SIDS - but by 2016 just 40 percent of ads still showed babies sleeping this way. \n\nBut the study also found some troubling differences in how cribs were marketed to low-income families and people of color. \n\nWhile white children were featured in most of the advertisements, none of the ads that featured non-white children adhered to safe sleep guidelines, the study found. \n\nAds for the least expensive cribs were also the least likely to follow safe sleep guidelines. \n\nThe most common safety problem in the ads was showing crib bumpers, which appeared in 70 percent of unsafe sleep environments depicted, according to the December 19 Pediatrics online report. \n\nLoose bedding was another common issue, shown in 56 percent of the unsafe crib images. \n\nSoft objects like stuffed animals were found in 13 percent of the unsafe sleep environments. \n\nThe researchers acknowledge that retailers who place the ads may be using stock images provided by the manufacturers, which might not represent the sleeping environments the stores want to promote. \n\nStill, the findings suggest that either child safety advocates are not effectively educating advertisers and manufacturers, or advertisers and manufacturers are prioritizing money over the safety of infants, Dr. Jeffrey Colvin, a pediatrician at Children's Mercy Kansas City who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. \n\nParents often mistakenly believe products must be safe if they're on sale, said Helen Ball, director of the Parent-Infant Sleep Lab at Durham University in the U.K. \n\n\"Unfortunately, this is not true,\" Ball, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. \n\nAds that depict unsafe sleep habits can send parents the wrong message and undermine doctors' efforts to teach the right way to put babies to bed, said Dr. Michael Goodstein, a member of AAP's task force on SIDS who wasn't involved in the study. \n\n\"This study reconfirms that health care providers need to continue to educate families consistently about infant sleep safety,\" Goodstein said by email. \"It is the one area in which we can truly reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related deaths.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.89435601234436, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 628, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.80495429464, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161219210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.86624203821656, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/21/lots-teen-screen-time-tied-to-obesity.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 582, "scraper_regex": 628}}, "headline": "Lots of teen screen time tied to obesity", "wordcount_as_scraped": 628, "date": "20161221130000", "story_content": "Too much television time has long been linked to childhood obesity, but a U.S. study suggests that the connection holds true for smaller screens too, such as computers, gaming consoles, tablets and smartphones.\n\nWith TV, a minimum five-hour-a-day habit increased the odds of obesity by 78 percent compared with teens who didn't have TV time, the study found. Such heavy use of other screens was tied to a 43 percent greater risk of obesity, researchers report in the Journal of Pediatrics.\n\n\"The landscape has changed so quickly with regards to how much we all use mobile screen devices and computers,\" said lead study author Dr. Erica, a public health researcher at Harvard University in Boston.\n\n\"We have known for years now that spending too much time watching television contributes to a higher risk of developing obesity among kids, mostly because watching too much TV can lead to an unhealthy diet,\" Kenney added by email. \"We see similar associations between other screen device use and diet, physical activity, and obesity risk as we've seen in the past for TV.\"\n\nTo assess how screens large and small influence the risk of obesity, researchers looked at nationally representative survey data collected in 2013 and 2015 on 24,800 adolescents in grades 9 to 12.\n\nNearly 17 percent of youth said they watched no TV on weekdays, while 7.8 percent said they watched five hours or more daily.\n\nNearly one in five teens in the study spent at least five hours a day using smaller screens during the week.\n\nThe survey also asked how many sugary drinks teens consumed and inquired about teens' height and weight.\n\nMore than 25 percent of boys and about 20 percent of girls reported consuming at least one soda or other sugar-sweetened beverage a day.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of boys and three-quarters of girls said they didn't get daily exercise.\n\nOverall, 14 percent of the teens in the study were obese.\n\nAfter adjusting for age, sex, race and ethnicity and other time with tiny screens, TV viewing was associated with significantly higher odds of consuming one or more sugary drinks and an increased risk of obesity.\n\nMore time with other screens was independently linked to higher odds of insufficient sleep, drinking more sugary beverages and inactivity.\n\nThe study can't prove that television or time on smaller screens causes obesity, however.\n\nIt's also possible that excessive screen time was caused by obesity, inactivity or fatigue rather than these things being caused by too much time with TVs, smartphones or tablets, the authors note.\n\nSome previous research has found TV causes obesity and that kids who cut back on television can improve their weight, said Dr. David Hill, a researcher at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Communications and Media.\n\nThe role of other screens has been less clear, with at least one study suggesting only passive TV watching affects obesity risk, Hill, who wasn't involved in the current study, said by email.\n\n\"This study helps us understand that the link between obesity and media use may extend to other types of screens,\" Hill said.\n\nThis connection may be at least in part due to ads teens see for unhealthy foods, Hill added. Decreased sleep is also tied to obesity, and too much screen time is known to interfere with the amount and quality of sleep teens get.\n\n\"We encourage parents to work with kids to examine what they need to accomplish in a day to be successful: how much sleep should they get, when should they eat, how much time do they need for homework, exercise, and family activities,\" Hill said. \"Screen media time should then fit in around those activities or complement them rather than displacing them.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.5015015602111799, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 582, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.14991914915, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 4, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.687285223367698, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.363636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/03/iran-activist-ends-71-day-prison-hunger-strike-as-wife-freed.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [90]}}, "headline": "Iran activist ends 71-day prison hunger strike as wife freed", "wordcount_as_scraped": 538, "date": "20170103150000", "story_content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2013 \u00a0An imprisoned Iranian human rights activist ended a 71-day hunger strike Tuesday as his detained wife won a temporary release from prison, a day after his case sparked a rare unauthorized protest in Tehran.\n\nArash Sadeghi was to be taken to a hospital, his lawyer Amir Raisian said, while Amnesty International said he would be fed intravenously.

Such protests have been rare in Iran after violence that followed the country's disputed 2009 presidential election.\n\nReformist lawmaker Bahram Parsai said earlier that he and other legislators met with court officials to discuss Sadeghi's case, signaling the growing concern officials had over the campaign.\n\n\"It was supposed to solve the case resorting to prudence, in a way that would not be misused by enemies,\" Parsai said, according to the semi-official ILNA news agency. \"We do not want such cases to turn into a problem for the system,\" he said, apparently referring to Western criticism of Iran's human rights record.\n\nSadeghi is serving a 15-year sentence over charges including \"spreading propaganda against the system\" and \"insulting the founder of the Islamic Republic,\" according to Amnesty. The London-based advocacy group has said Sadeghi's charges stem in part from his communication with them.\n\nSadeghi's hunger strike began Oct. 24 after authorities arrested his wife to make her serve a six-year sentence over an unpublished fictional story found in her home about a woman burning a Quran in anger over another woman being stoned to death for adultery.\n\n\"The release of Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee today comes as a welcome relief but is long overdue,\" Amnesty researcher Nassim Papayianni said in a statement. \"Neither she nor her husband, Arash Sadeghi, should have ever been forced to spend a single minute behind bars.\"\n\nDual nationals, artists, poets, journalists, fashion models and activists have been arrested in a crackdown on expression led by hard-liners who oppose President Hassan Rouhani's more moderate policies and efforts to promote greater openness to the outside world.

Mortuary worker Latafatullah Hassan said he fears the infant's parents were also among the dead.\n\nThe mortuary is cold. The child's body is uncovered. He looks as if he could be sleeping, with no visible wounds from the suicide bombing of a crowded Sufi shrine in the midst of a crowded religious celebration.\n\nThe Islamic State group's local affiliate, calling itself the Khorasan Province, claimed responsibility \u2014 saying that a suicide bomber had attacked \"Shiites\" at the Shah Noorani shrine in the remote Khuzdar district of Baluchistan province. The bomber struck amid diverse crowds full of women and children during the traditional Sufi dhammal dance. The shrine is frequented by both Pakistan's majority Sunni and minority Shiite Muslims.\n\nGulam Rasool arrived frantically at the mortuary, waving the identity card of his cousin \u2014 an elderly looking man with a long white beard. \"I've been everywhere, to every hospital but I can't find him. They told me to come here.\"\n\nAn ambulance with a body inside screamed to the gate. Rasool shoved past people to reach the vehicle. But it wasn't his cousin.\n\nInside the ambulance was the corpse of 16-year-old Bilal, accompanied by his father, Sabir. The older man's brown shalwar kameez was soaked with sweat and tears covered his cheeks. Sabir, who didn't give his family name, said his only son had been on his first-ever visit to the shrine with a group of friends. Now he was bringing his body to be washed and wrapped in a white shroud in keeping with Islamic burial custom.\n\nSenior police official Azad Khan said the area around the shrine is a known hotbed for sectarian militants. It is the home turf of Shafique Mengal, who was once a leader in the virulently anti-Shiite Muslim group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. Two years ago Mengal declared allegiance to the Islamic State group.\n\nKhan said that Mengal and his followers have found safe havens across the border in Afghanistan. He also said that both local and foreign militants, including Uzbek nationals, have begun carrying out attacks on behalf of IS.\n\nIn Karachi, paramilitary rangers and police have raided dozens of madrassas, or Islamic religious schools, in recent days in search of militants aligned with militant sectarian groups. Meanwhile the frequent Sunni militant attacks on Shiites, who make up about 25 percent of Pakistan's 180 million people, have resulted in retaliatory attacks on Sunnis from a Shiite militant group known as the TNFJ.\n\nDr. Abdiul Qadir Siddiqui, chief of Karachi's trauma center, said the majority of the injuries were caused by ball-bearings that peppered the bodies of worshippers when the suicide bomber detonated his explosive device. Authorities say 108 people were hurt.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Sameer had gone to the shrine along with his friends. One friend died at the scene and Sameer was in the trauma unit unable to move his broken legs.\n\n\"I remember a loud noise and people everywhere were dying. I saw legs and arms and I dragged myself away, hoping for help,\" he said.\n\nMaj. Gen. Sher Afghan, of the Frontier Corps in Baluchistan, said the bomber had strapped about six kilograms of explosives to his body. The explosive device was packed with ball-bearings and nine-millimeter bullets, he said.\n\nAt the mortuary, grieving family members discussed the IS claim of responsibility.\n\nMohammed Aslam questioned the claim as he searched for his 15-year-old daughter Fatima.\n\n\"How can a Muslim ever say that he did something like this. He is not a Muslim,\" said Aslam.\n\nAmbulances carrying more bodies continued to arrive. One worker, Mir Hasan, could barely keep his red eyes open as he carried another body on a stretcher into the ice-cold room to wait to be claimed.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Adil Jawad contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.29986047744751, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 642, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.11753239991, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161113150000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.58255451713396, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/21/white-house-says-6-4-million-have-enrolled-in-obamacare-this-year.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [78]}}, "headline": "White House says 6.4 million have enrolled in ObamaCare this year", "wordcount_as_scraped": 804, "date": "20161221230000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0\"Obamacare\" seems to be holding its own. The administration said Wednesday that 6.4 million people have enrolled for subsidized private coverage through HealthCare.gov, ahead of last year's pace.\n\nDespite rising premiums, dwindling insurers, and the Republican vow to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law, about 400,000 more people signed up through Monday than for a comparable period in 2015, the Department of Health and Human Services Department said.\n\n\"Today's enrollment numbers confirm that doomsday predictions about the marketplace are not bearing out,\" said HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell.\n\nStill, it's too early for supporters of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to say \"I told you so.\" It's unclear if the administration will meet its target of 13.8 million sign-ups.\n\nThat's partly because the share of new customers is down when compared with current consumers re-upping for another year.\n\nNew customers are 32 percent of the total this year versus 40 percent around the same time last year. Administration officials said they're going to focus on getting more new customers between now and the end of open enrollment Jan. 31.\n\nOther vital signs for HealthCare.gov were encouraging.\n\n\"There are zero signs that the ACA's marketplaces are in danger of imminent collapse,\" said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, who has followed the health care law from its inception.\n\nThat carries an implicit warning for President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, who have promised to move quickly to repeal the law. That repeal would be followed by a GOP-inspired replacement. Although immediate changes affecting 2017 are unlikely, the whole process could take several years, creating uncertainty for people with coverage.\n\nAs if on cue, Democratic governors Wednesday fired off a letter to GOP congressional leaders, calling the repeal plan \"nothing more than a Washington, D.C., bait-and-switch\" that would leave millions uninsured and shift to states an estimated $69 billion over a decade in uncompensated care costs.\n\nThe statistics released Wednesday are for 39 states served by the federal online insurance marketplace. Numbers from states running their own markets have not been fully tallied, and will be added later, raising the total. Toward the end of this month, several million current customers who are being re-enrolled automatically will be added to the count.\n\nSome of the biggest sign-up numbers so far are coming from states Trump won in the presidential election, including Florida (1.3 million); Texas (776,000); North Carolina (369,000); Georgia (352,000), and Pennsylvania (291,000). Vice president-elect Mike Pence's home state of Indiana had 119,000 residents enrolled.\n\nPremiums for a midlevel benchmark plan in HealthCare.gov states are going up an average of 25 percent next year, driven by lower-than-expected enrollment and higher medical costs. At the same time, about one-third of U.S. counties will have only one marketplace insurer next year because some major commercial carriers have left the market, and many nonprofit insurance co-ops created by the law have collapsed.\n\nThe impact of premium increases has been softened by the law's subsidies, which are designed to rise if the cost of insurance goes up.\n\nA study last week from the nonpartisan Center for Health and Economy found that the average monthly subsidy will increase by $76, or 26 percent, from $291 currently to $367 in 2017.\n\nBut that means taxpayers will fork over nearly $10 billion more. The study estimated that the cost of premium subsidies will increase by $9.8 billion next year, rising from $32.8 billion currently to $42.6 billion.\n\nEven if the law's rising subsidies are working to keep customers in the market, independent analyst Caroline Pearson of the consulting firm Avalere Health said the apparent slow-down in new consumers should concern the administration.\n\n\"At this time, enrollment appears to be slightly behind the pace needed to reach the administration's goal of signing up 13.8 million people,\" she said. \"However, if more people who are currently in the market renew their coverage, then that goal could still be achieved.\"\n\nHealthCare.gov's advertising in the closing weeks of open enrollment will be aimed at attracting new customers, said HHS Secretary Burwell. In addition, the IRS will be sending people who paid fines for being uninsured a not-too-subtle nudge, reminding them that they can avoid higher penalties for 2017 by signing up now.\n\nRepublicans plan to repeal \"Obamacare\" early next year, but it could take up to several years to replace it. During the interlude, party leaders have promised an orderly transition to a new system. It's unclear what that would involve, but presumably some of the law's popular provisions \u2014 such as subsidies and protection for those with pre-existing medical conditions \u2014 would be kept in place.\n\nThe 2010 health overhaul added coverage for about 20 million people through a combination of subsidized private health insurance and a state option to expand Medicaid. Several Republican states adopted the Medicaid expansion, including Indiana under Pence.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.900900900363922, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 793, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.1934851036799996, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.39596469104666, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/18/california-snafu-releases-personal-info-nearly-4000-gun-safety-instructors.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1910, 3646]}}, "headline": "California snafu releases personal info of nearly 4,000 gun safety instructors", "wordcount_as_scraped": 637, "date": "20170118210000", "story_content": "The private information of thousands of California firearms instructors was accidentally released by the state late last year in response to a journalist's Freedom of Information request.\n\nThe data request was made in August, when a reporter for Southern California Public Radio (KPCC), an NPR affiliate, sought all information on Firearms Safety Certifications available from the California Department of Justice.\n\nThe information was released in October, and a clerical error gave the reporter wide access to the personal information of 3,424 firearms instructors -- whose dates of birth, driver's license numbers and California identification numbers were handed over, according to NRA-ILA, the legislative arm of the National Rifle Association.\n\nThe error was caught two months later, and the California DOJ sent out a letter to all of the Golden State's instructors letting them know their personal information had been compromised.\n\n\"The Department discovered the data breach on October 17, 2016, and notified the requestor of the error and asked that the information be destroyed and that no further dissemination of it occur,\" said the letter, sent by the Office of the Attorney General Kamala Harris. Harris is now a U.S. senator.\n\nThe letter also recommended the firearm instructors place a fraud alert on their credit. Since driver's license numbers are appealing to identity thieves, a fraud alert could prevent criminals from misusing someone's personal data.\n\nNRA officials blasted the California DOJ for its data breach and questioned why it took the department so long to alert the thousands who were affected.\n\n\"This privacy breach is just another example of the California Department of Justice's disregard for the rights of gun owners,\" Jennifer Baker, director of public affairs for the NRA, said to FoxNews.com.\u00a0 \"There's no reason why the private information of firearms instructors should have been released \u2013 the DOJ redacts information all the time.\"\n\nBaker also questioned the length of time it took the state to inform victims of the breach.\n\n\"It's time the California government start awarding gun owners the same respect as it does non-gun owners.\"\n\nSome security experts said that while it wasn't a significant data breach, there is still cause for concern.\n\n\"The main concern, if any, would be identity theft, simply because it is so prevalent,\" police consultant and retired Los Angeles Police Lt. Raymond Foster said to FoxNews.com. \"I don't think anyone would threaten these instructors, but one concern is that many of them are retired police officers and that could put them at an additional risk. Most of them when they are off-duty like to lie low and blend in.\n\n\"But I'd imagine that NPR would never publish this info and would likely just rip it up.\"\n\nThe reporter, who the NRA-ILA identifies as Aaron Mendelson, acknowledged in his FOIA request that part of his request would be redacted.\n\n\"\u2026Please inform me of the redaction and the legal justification for it,\" said the request, which was obtained by FoxNews.com.\n\nSince receiving the data, it appears that none of the information has been published in any recent stories. In its letter to firearm instructors, the California DOJ said that it had asked the reporter to destroy the information he received and if he did not do so he would face legal action.\n\nNeither Mendelson nor officials for Southern California Public Radio immediately returned calls for comment.\n\nGun instructors in California took the news of their information being released in stride. Dennis Santiago,\u00a0an independent gun safety instructor in the Los Angeles area, who received the DOJ letter, told FoxNews.com he at first thought it was a hacking incident.\n\n\"I was speaking with other instructors at a gun shop about it and they didn't seem too concerned,\" Santiago said. \"They took it as being the cost of being in America.\"\n\nPerry Chiaramonte is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

He was 86.\n\nBuckingham Palace said that Queen Elizabeth II, Margaret's sister, had been told that he died.\n\n\"The Earl of Snowdon died peacefully at home on 13th January 2017,\" said Camera Press, the photo agency with which he worked.\n\nOne of the country's most famous photographers, Snowdon was one of the few top-echelon royals to hold down an outside job after he married the queen's sister in 1960, and his professional reputation grew steadily.\n\nMargaret died in 2002.\n\nSnowdon was admired for his discretion, never speaking with the media about the breakup of the marriage in 1978, and rejecting offers to write a book about it. But over time a number of details about his complicated love life emerged.\n\nBorn Antony Armstrong-Jones, he was a slightly bohemian member of London's smart set and an established society photographer when he and the queen's sister surprised the country with their engagement in February 1960.\n\nThey had met at a London party and managed to keep their courtship a secret in the months that followed, despite intense interest in Margaret's romantic life.\n\nUnconventional, artistic and not nearly as wealthy as Margaret's other suitors, Armstrong-Jones lived in a studio in west London and did his own cooking. He was certainly not seen by the public and press as a royal prospect.\n\nThe \"Jones Boy\" married the high-spirited Margaret at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 1960, in the first royal wedding to be televised. Whatever doubts the country might have had about his suitability were swept aside by general relief that Margaret had, at last, found love. It had been five years since her widely publicized decision to end her romance with divorced war hero Peter Townsend after pressure from church leaders, political figures and her own family.\n\nArmstrong-Jones was named the Earl of Snowdon in October 1961, in time to give a title to their first child, David, Viscount Linley, born the following month. Linley became a successful furniture designer. His sister, Lady Sarah, born in May 1964, became a painter.\n\nMargaret, unlike most of the royal family, shared her husband's interest in the arts, and the two moved in a circle of creative people at a time when \"swinging London\" gained a worldwide reputation for music, clothes, films and clubs.\n\nIn 1969, Snowdon designed the setting for the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales at Caernarvon Castle in Wales.\n\nSnowdon was born March 7, 1930, the son of lawyer Ronald Armstrong-Jones and Anne Messel, sister of celebrated stage designer Oliver Messel.\n\nSnowdon's first exposure to the world of celebrity came as a teenager when his uncle Oliver Messel brought Noel Coward and Marlene Dietrich to the hospital to sing to him after he was stricken with polio.\n\nSnowdon was educated at Eton and studied architecture at Cambridge University, where he failed his final exams.\n\nHe did an apprenticeship with Baron, the leading society photographer of the day, then set himself up as a theatrical photographer. By the late 1950s he was doing a considerable amount of work for fashion magazines.\n\nHe had a sense of humor and engaging manner that put his subjects at ease, and he brought a new informality to portraits of the royal family.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Snowdon's marriage to Margaret was beset by rumors of infidelity. They separated in 1976 and quietly divorced in 1978.\n\nSnowdon married Lucy Lindsay Hogg, and had a daughter, Frances, in 1979. They divorced in 2000.\n\nMargaret did not remarry, and she died following a stroke in 2002.\n\nIn the 1990s, two relationships Snowdon had with other women became public.\n\nAfter the suicide of 55-year-old journalist Ann Hills in 1997, it was revealed that she had known Snowdon for 20 years, had been a longtime lover and had remained a close friend.\n\nIn April 1998, journalist Melanie Cable-Alexander gave birth to a son, Jasper, and said Snowdon was the father. He did not deny it.\n\nIn later years, Snowdon was troubled by the effects of polio, which left him with a slight limp, and he had difficulty standing for any length of time. He endowed a fund that provides scholarships for disabled students.\n\nSnowdon remained a favorite photographer of the queen long after his marriage to her sister ended in rancor, and he took many portraits of her. Diana, Princess of Wales, was another frequent subject.\n\nSnowdon received a rare honor in 2001 when the National Portrait Gallery presented a retrospective of his work, with more than 180 examples exhibited. Yet he remained modest about his skills.\n\n\"If I had a style I'd consider that one of my failings,\" he said \"The person you're photographing is the important person. The photographer should be a chameleon.\"\n\nHe produced 14 photographic books and made seven television documentaries on a wide range of social issues. The first, \"Don't Count the Candles,\" about old age, won two Emmy awards in 1968.\n\nHe designed the Snowdon aviary for the London Zoo. One of his favorite projects, it is an aluminum tension structure and one of the zoo's biggest attractions.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.97152245044708, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 809, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.6499745272500004, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170114020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.22496909765142, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/27/few-young-men-are-unable-to-report-last-partners-contraceptive-use.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Few young men are unable to report last partner's contraceptive use", "wordcount_as_scraped": 685, "date": "20161227170000", "story_content": "Most young men say they know whether their last sexual partner used birth control and what kind it was, according to a recent U.S. study.\n\nThe results provide valuable data for programs intended to prevent unplanned pregnancies that are aimed at young men, the researchers write in American Journal of Men's Health.\n\n\"The scope of the study was really just to look at whether we could use young men's report in conducting evaluations of teen pregnancy prevention programs, or other research studies that rely on young men's report,\" lead author Samantha Garbers told Reuters Health in an email.\n\n\"But, it also has implications for programming around communication skills around birth control for young men, such as skill building around talking with new partners about birth control,\" said Garbers, a researcher at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York.\n\nUnlike many other studies, Garbers said, in this case the study team focused on how many young men were not able to answer the questions about their partner's contraception use.\n\n\"We were specifically interested in how many guys said they don't know - which is usually not reported when the results get written up,\" she said.\n\nGarbers and her colleagues examined data taken from the 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth, a large study that included men and women 14 to 44 years old.\n\nThe researchers analyzed responses from 2,238 men whose last female sex partner was not someone they were living with or married to, and who were not trying to get pregnant with a partner or already had a partner that was pregnant.\n\nAbout 85 percent of the men were never married and almost half were between the ages of 15 and 24.\n\nParticipants were asked, \"That last time that you had sexual intercourse with (most recent partner) did she use any methods to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease?\" Those who answered \"yes\" were next asked what methods their partner had used and were shown a list of contraceptive methods to choose from.\n\n\"We were relieved to find that almost all men of all age groups were able to answer the questions,\" Garbers said. \"Overall, 95 percent were able to answer both questions, and this did not differ significantly across age groups.\"\n\nThe study could only determine if the men could answer the questions, but not if their answers were accurate, Garbers noted.\n\nAbout 17 percent of the men said no contraception was used at all in their last sexual encounter, and another 30 percent said they had used condoms but their partner did not use contraception.\n\nRace, ethnicity, education, even religious affiliations didn't appear to affect the results, Garbers said, but what really mattered was the relationship between the male and his last partner.\n\n\"Guys whose last sexual partner was a new partner, meaning they had not had sex with that partner before that encounter, were significantly more likely to be unable to report whether their partner used a specific method\" she said.\n\nAlmost 12 percent of the participants whose last encounter was with a new partner couldn't report her birth control use, compared to less than 4 percent of men whose last partner wasn't new.\n\n\"This study highlights the importance of communication around the issues of contraception and safe sex in any relationship. It takes both a man and a woman to get pregnant, so both partners should be aware of what they are doing to prevent pregnancy,\" Dr. Rachel Weinerman told Reuters Health in an email.\n\n\"It is reassuring to see that the overwhelming majority of men knew about their partner's contraceptive use,\" said Weinerman, a reproductive endocrinologist at the University Hospitals Ahuja Medical Center in Beachwood, Ohio, and UH Cleveland Medical Center who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nThe findings also emphasize how important it is to have a conversation about safe sex prior to that initial sexual encounter, Weinerman said.\n\n\"Every relationship is going to be different, but it doesn't have to be a long or awkward discussion. 'What kind of birth control do you use?' is a straightforward question that female partners should appreciate,\" she said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.65289258956909, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 672, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.8982375470700001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 13, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161227170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.9345238095238102, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.1818181818200002}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/12/ex-cia-officer-faces-imminent-extradition-to-italy-hopes-trump-can-help.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [258, 1164, 1286, 1494, 2066, 2077, 2087, 2203, 2472, 2538, 3039, 3783, 3792, 4036, 4293, 4448, 4660, 4661, 4821, 4975, 5075, 5873, 6052]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 958, "scraper_regex": 1090}}, "headline": "Ex-CIA officer faces imminent extradition to Italy, hopes Trump can help", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1090, "date": "20170112220000", "story_content": "CIA officer Sabrina De Sousa was skiing with her son in Northern Italy on a chilly February day in 2003 when agents snatched a suspected terrorist off the streets of Milan as part of the\u00a0CIA's \"extraordinary rendition\" program.\n\nFourteen years later, De Sousa faces imminent extradition from Portugal to Italy and six years in jail in connection with the abduction after being convicted in absentia by Italian courts for a decision made by the highest levels of U.S. government.\n\nDe Sousa, who no longer works for the agency, is now poised to become the first CIA officer and U.S. diplomat imprisoned over the controversial rendition program -- and is making an urgent appeal for intervention.\n\n\"I'm a scapegoat,\" De Sousa told FoxNews.com Wednesday, in an extensive phone interview from her home in Portugal.\n\nThe former officer claims the Obama administration has ignored all requests to intervene on her behalf but hopes the incoming Donald Trump administration might be able to help.\n\nTime is not on her side.\n\nTrump's inauguration would come after the Italy-set Jan. 17 extradition date.\u00a0According to De Sousa, this would \"set a hugely bad precedent for the conviction by an allied nation of a U.S. diplomat.\"\u00a0\n\nHOEKSTRA: DON'T LET ONE OF OUR INTEL OFFICERS WIND UP IN JAIL\n\nDe Souza was working in Milan as an undercover CIA officer in 2003 when U.S. and Italian intelligence agents abducted radical Egyptian cleric,\u00a0Osama Mustapha Hassan Nasr -- also known as Abu Omar -- and transported him to his native Egypt for interrogation.\n\nThe authorized operation was part of the controversial program implemented under President George W. Bush in which terror suspects could be transferred to countries where torture is allowed.\n\nOmar -- who turned out to be a \"nobody,\" according to De Sousa -- was held at an American military base in Germany before being flown to Cairo, Egypt, where he claims he was tortured. He was soon released from prison for lack of prosecutable evidence against him.\u00a0\n\nIn 2009,\u00a0De Sousa,\u00a0along with 25 other Americans, were convicted in absentia on kidnapping and other charges related to the abduction.\u00a0Several were since pardoned and not one has done time in prison. The Italians also convicted Omar in absentia of \"criminal association for the purposes of international terrorism\" and sentenced him to six years in prison.\n\nPhone records obtained by Italian prosecutors\u00a0corroborated De Sousa's claim that she was some 130 miles away in\u00a0Madonna di Campiglio, Italy, chaperoning her son's school ski trip, on the day Omar was abducted. Still, Italy brought \"broad charges\" against her for a plot she says she had no direct part in.\n\n\"[The Italians] said, 'She was responsible for planning and without her OK, it never would have happened,'\" De Sousa told FoxNews.com. \"And this came third-hand from someone who told an Italian intelligence officer.\"\n\n\"We are being convicted for decisions made for which we had no input at all,\" she said.\u00a0\"Nobody wants to look any higher, and this is the best way to deflect attention from anyone else.\"\n\nThe former spy, who was born in India and holds both American and Portuguese passports, left the CIA in 2009 and moved to Portugal in April 2015 to be near family.\n\nIn October 2015, she was detained at Lisbon's airport on a European arrest warrant while attempting to travel to India. She was later released but ordered to remain in Portugal.\n\nThe series of events that followed amount to an international legal nightmare.\n\nItaly first sought extradition of De Sousa with the guarantee of a retrial or appeal with new evidence, acknowledging she had been tried in absentia. Based on these guarantees, the Portuguese courts agreed to extradite.\u00a0\n\nBut in\u00a0June 2016, Italy sent Portugal a letter saying De Sousa's conviction was final, and no retrial would be granted. In a move that shocked De Sousa and others in the intelligence community, Portugal's high court ordered her immediate extradition.\u00a0\n\nDe Sousa acknowledges her move from the U.S. to Portugal was \"catastrophic.\" The 61-year-old mother, who recently underwent eye surgery, has been ordered by her doctor to remain in Portugal until her recovery. Her extradition date is now set for Jan. 17.\u00a0\n\nThis follows years of unsuccessful bids to clear her name. De Sousa said she continues to cling to hope that a new administration might come to her aid.\u00a0\n\n\"I would really like to reach out to the Trump administration,\" she said, noting that, in her view, the president-elect is beholden to no one and not interested in protecting those who authorized the program. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"I think a General [Mike] Flynn in the administration \u2013 I can't see him allowing the prosecution of a senior military officer by a foreign nation,\" she said.\u00a0\n\nIt's unclear what action, if any, the Trump administration may take on the case, but a member of the transition team has sent background information on\u00a0De Sousa's situation to senior officials with the incoming administration, FoxNews.com has learned.\u00a0\n\nTransition team spokesmen have not responded to requests for an official comment.\n\nAsked for comment on the case, a State Department spokesperson referred FoxNews.com to De Sousa's lawyer for specific details but said they've seen reports that a Portuguese Court plans to transfer her and \"we can say that the Department of State takes its obligation to assist U.S. citizens overseas seriously.\"\n\nThe official said: \"This is a matter that U.S. officials have been following closely. We have asked our European counterparts what their next steps may be, but we are not in a position to detail those discussions.\"\n\nAside from warnings about the precedent that could be set, De Sousa also claimed such a trial would be unfair, since she would not be permitted to divulge state secrets.\n\nFormer Rep.\u00a0Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., an outspoken advocate of De Sousa, said he has appealed to members of the Obama administration on her behalf -- because \"it seemed like a slam-dunk case.\"\u00a0\n\n\"What's happening to her is inherently wrong,\" Hoekstra told FoxNews.com. \"You've got an alleged case officer who's going to go to jail [for] doing exactly what the American government ... asked her to do.\"\n\n\"The executive branch leaders can continue to travel throughout Europe -- they face no consequences,\" he said. \"Some of the people have gotten pardons and all of the Italians no longer face consequences.\"\n\nHoekstra, too, expressed hope that Trump would intervene.\n\n\"Donald Trump supports the little guy,\" he said. \"And I think in this case I would like to believe and I would expect that he would be on the side of Sabrina.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.17406749725342, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 958, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.29624198915, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170112220000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.2964509394572, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/24/gop-on-taxes-cut-rates-brackets-but-what-about-deficit.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "GOP on taxes: Cut rates, brackets but what about the deficit", "wordcount_as_scraped": 949, "date": "20161224160000", "story_content": "Congressional Republicans are planning a massive overhaul of the nation's tax system next year, a heavy political lift that could ultimately affect families at every income level and businesses of every size.\n\nTheir goal is to simplify a complicated tax code that rewards wealthy people with smart accountants, and corporations that can easily shift profits -- and jobs -- overseas. It won't be easy. The last time it was done was 30 years ago.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have vowed to pass a tax package that would not add to the budget. The Washington term is \"revenue neutral.\"\n\nIt means that for every tax cut there has to be a tax increase, creating winners and losers. Lawmakers would get some leeway if non-partisan congressional analysts project that a tax cut would increase economic growth, raising revenue without increasing taxes.\n\nNevertheless, passing a massive tax package will require some tough votes, politically.\n\nSome key Republican senators want to share the political risk with Democrats. They argue that a tax overhaul must be bipartisan to be fully embraced by the public. \n\nThey cite President Barack Obama's health law -- which passed in 2010 without any Republican votes -- as a major policy initiative that remains divisive.\n\nCongressional Democrats say they are eager to have a say in overhauling the tax code. But McConnell, who faulted Democrats for acting unilaterally on health care, is laying the groundwork to pass a purely partisan bill.\n\nMcConnell and Ryan said they plan to use a legislative maneuver that would prevent Senate Democrats from using the filibuster to block a tax bill.\n\nMcConnell says he wants the Senate to tackle a tax plan in the spring, after Congress repeals Obama's health law. House Republicans are more eager to get started, but haven't set a timeline.\n\nSome things to know about Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code:\n\nTHE HOUSE PLAN\n\nHouse Republicans have released the outline of a tax plan that would lower the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three. \n\nThe gist of the plan is to lower tax rates for just about everyone, and make up the lost revenue by scaling back exemptions, deductions and credits.\n\nThe plan, however, retains some of the most popular tax breaks, including those for paying a mortgage, going to college, making charitable contributions and having children.\n\nThe standard deduction would be increased, giving taxpayers less incentive to itemize their deductions.\n\nThe non-partisan Tax Policy Center says the plan would reduce revenues by $3 trillion over the first decade, with most of the savings going to the highest-income households.\n\nThat's not revenue neutral.\n\nSmall business owners would get a special top tax rate of 25 percent.\n\nInvestment income would be taxed like wages, but investors would only have to pay taxes on half of this income.\n\nSENATE PLAN\n\nSenate Republicans have yet to coalesce around a comprehensive plan, or even an outline.\n\nTRUMP'S PLAN\n\nTrump's plan has fewer details. He promises a tax cut for every income level, with more low-income families paying no income tax at all.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center says Trump's plan would reduce revenues by a whopping $9.5 trillion over the first decade, with most of the tax benefits going to the wealthiest taxpayers. Trump has disputed the analysis.\n\nLike the House plan, Trump would reduce the top income tax rate for individuals to 33 percent, and he would reduce the number of tax brackets to three. He would also increase the standard deduction.\n\nTrump has embraced two ideas championed by Obama but repeatedly rejected by Republicans over the past eight years. Trump's plan would cap itemized deductions for married couples making more than $200,000 a year. \n\nIt would also tax carried interest, which are fees charged by investment fund managers, as regular income instead of capital gains.\n\nCORPORATE TAXES\n\nThe top corporate income tax rate in the U.S. is 35 percent, the highest in the industrialized world. However, the tax is riddled with so many exemptions, deductions and credits that most corporations pay much less.\n\nTrump and House Republicans want to lower the rate, and pay for it by scaling back tax breaks.\n\nTrump wants to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. Ryan says 20 percent is more realistic, to avoid increasing the budget deficit.\n\nBORDER ADJUSTMENT TAX\n\nThis is one of the most controversial parts of the House Republicans' tax plan. It is also key to making it work.\n\nUnder current law, the United States taxes the profits of U.S.-based companies, even if the money is made overseas. However, taxes on foreign income are deferred until a company either reinvests the profits in the U.S. or distributes them to shareholders.\n\nCritics say the system encourages U.S.-based corporations to invest profits overseas or, more dramatically, to shift operations and jobs abroad to avoid U.S. taxes.\n\nHouse Republicans want to scrap America's worldwide tax system and replace it with a tax that is based on where a firm's products are consumed, rather than where they are produced.\n\nUnder the system, American companies that produce and sell their products in the U.S. would pay the new 20 percent corporate tax rate on profits from these sales. However, if a company exports a product abroad, the profits from that sale would not be taxed by the U.S.\n\nThere's more: Foreign companies that import goods to the U.S. would have to pay the tax, increasing the cost of imports.\n\nExporters love the idea. But importers, including big retailers and consumer electronics firms, say it could lead to steep price increases on consumer goods. The lobbying has already begun.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.64004039764404, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 910, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.77214442633, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161224160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.64835164835165, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/16/dems-media-skewing-trumps-record-on-lgbt-issues.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2670, 2736, 3160, 4276]}}, "headline": "Dems, media skewing Trump's record on LGBT issues?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 697, "date": "20161116230000", "story_content": "Months after businessman Peter Thiel made history as the first openly gay speaker to address his sexuality from a Republican convention podium, and mere hours after it emerged President-elect Donald Trump was considering an openly gay man for U.N. ambassador, the leader of a prominent gay conservatives group was still fielding calls from worried members of the LGBT community.\n\n\"Please tell me we don't have anything to fear,\" callers continually asked Log Cabin Republicans leader Gregory Angelo.\n\nGiven the media coverage that's greeted Trump's victory a week ago, it's not too difficult to see where the worries originate: The New York Times wrote about the billionaire's election as \"a devastating loss\" for the gay community; Mother Jones ran a piece on rising calls to LGBT suicide prevention hotlines; Senate Minority Leader Democrat Harry Reid issued a statement Friday citing accounts of \"gay and lesbian couples having slurs hurled at them and feeling afraid to walk down the street holding hands.\"\n\nBut gay conservative leaders like Angelo suggest that level of alarm doesn't seem to square with the rhetoric and actions emanating from Trump and his campaign.\n\nBARRON: TRUMP WILL BE FRIEND, ADVOCATE FOR LGBT COMMUNITY\n\nAside from Thiel's well-received convention speech, the Silicon Valley billionaire was named to the executive committee of Trump's presidential transition team. Ric Grenell, a former diplomat and a Fox News contributor, reportedly is on the short list to be U.S. ambassador to the U.N. \u2013 which would make him the first openly gay person to serve in that role.\n\nTrump said in April that transgender individuals should \"use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate,\" and he counts transgender celeb Caitlyn Jenner as a supporter. In a \"60 Minutes\" interview Sunday, Trump declared the issue of marriage equality to be \"settled.\"\n\n\"These do not sound like the words of someone who the LGBTQ community should be fearful of,\" Angelo told FoxNews.com. \"I don't believe we've ever had a president who has so explicitly made overtures to the LGBTQ community. That's unprecedented.\"\n\nOne of Trump's most noteworthy outreach efforts came July 21 at the Republican National Convention, in the aftermath of the June terrorist attack on Florida gay nightclub Pulse. Delivering his nomination acceptance speech, Trump assured those listening, \"As your president I will do everything in my power to protect LGBTQ citizens.\"\n\nThe convention crowd cheered at the line, prompting Trump to deliver an off-script aside: \"I must say, as a Republican it's so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said.\"\u00a0\n\nSuch remarks were a break from traditional Republican rhetoric.\u00a0\n\n\"Donald Trump won, not because he campaigned on social issues, but essentially because he campaigned on everything but social issues,\" Angelo said. \"Gone are the days where an exclusive focus on social issues is the crown jewel of a Republican presidential campaign.\"\n\nCritics \u2013 and even those willing to give Trump a chance, like Angelo \u2013 do have lingering gripes with Trump and his party, however, on gay rights issues.\u00a0\n\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, who's expected to wield a great deal of power and currently is leading the transition team, has long been a target of LGBT activists. As Indiana governor, Pence signed a religious freedom law that was strongly opposed by the LGBT community, and it was only after significant criticism that Pence signed an amendment to protect gays and lesbians. Pence has previously supported a constitutional amendment to define marriage as being between a man and a woman, opposed an employment non-discrimination act, opposed the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" and has stood against allowing transgender individuals to use the bathroom of the gender they associate with.\n\nThe official platform of Trump's party, too, is opposed to same-sex marriage and transgender bathroom laws.\n\nBut despite the sometimes conflicting agendas, Angelo sees opportunity.\n\n\"What you're seeing, if you look big picture, is an effort to bring together not just wings of the GOP, but parts of America that were traditionally viewed as incompatible,\" Angelo said. \"That's something that makes me very optimistic.\"\u00a0\n\nBefore the election, Grenell wrote in The Washington Times: \"No other Republican Presidential nominee in history has embraced the LGBT community in such a loud and proud way.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.0, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 683, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.49261322042, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161116230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.66032210834553, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/11/trump-pentagon-likely-to-abandon-social-experiments-for-core-mission-under-mattis-say-experts.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [776]}}, "headline": "Trump Pentagon likely to abandon social experiments for core mission under Mattis, say experts", "wordcount_as_scraped": 866, "date": "20170111220000", "story_content": "The Pentagon could be poised for a rapid about-face under the Trump administration, with the Obama administration's push for social reform surrendering to what could be an old-school emphasis on combat readiness and the spirit of the United States military, experts told FoxNews.com.\n\nUnder President Obama, the military sought to integrate transgender persons into the ranks, allow women into special operations forces and purge the nomenclature of gender-specific words, adopting what some critics say was a \"politically correct\" liberal agenda. That's a contrast to the traditional U.S. military approach.\n\nIn addition, some Navy ships have been named for civil rights activists.\u00a0 And while the Obama administration has taken an inclusive approach on some issues, it has also worked to minimize expressions of Christianity in the ranks. For example, several officers have been disciplined for displaying Bibles or gospel verses in their quarters.\n\nVeterans and military experts told FoxNews.com that, while some of Obama's civil rights advancements may be locked in, neither Trump nor his choice for secretary of defense, Gen. James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, are likely to make social experimentation a priority.\n\n\"Here in [the Pentagon], we don't say merry Christmas, and I think we have been misguided when it comes to our history and who we are as a nation, and political correctness is indicative of that,\" Department of Defense contractor and retired Army Col. Robert Maginnis told FoxNews.com.\n\n\"It has struck this building in a big way and we need to get away from that. Our focus is defending this country, and we should not spend so much time on social engineering.\"\n\nMattis, who on Thursday goes before the Senate Armed Services Committee as part of his confirmation process, will likely \"bring the warrior ethos back to the Pentagon,\" Maginnis said.\n\nThat mentality was \"drained by the Obama administration,\" he said. \"You need to be known as a good soldier or Marine and not by your sexuality, your gender or your particular faith. We need everyone to pull in the same direction and not espouse a particular personal agenda that doesn't fit into the nation's best long-term interest.\"\n\nRetired Army Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News contributor, said the strong emphasis on social reform in the last eight years sometimes came at the expense of the military's core objective.\n\n\"Social engineering was a distractor from what the main mission of the United States military was about,\" Keane said. \"We were involved in conflict and war, and these reforms achieved a level of prominence that subordinated the issue of war itself.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the outgoing Obama Department of Defense said Pentagon Secretary Ash Carter has \"made it clear\" that he will let the incoming administration make their own policy decisions, despite disagreements.\n\n\"The principle, put simply by Secretary Carter, is that if a service member wants to serve and is qualified to serve, and meets requirements to serve in that position, they should do so, and that is the principle that underlines all of this,\" the spokesperson told FoxNews.com. \"But it is entirely up to the next Administration and we are focused on ensuring they have all of the support that we can provide to ensure they enjoy a smooth, seamless transition.\"\n\nUnder a Mattis-led Department of Defense, Maginnis expects the issue of women in combat to be re-visited. One year ago Secretary of Defense Ash Carter opened direct land combat jobs in the infantry and special operations to women.\n\nLast year, Mattis said women should not be in combat because, if they were, the nation's enemies wouldn't fear \"America's awesome determination to defend herself.\" He said physical standards for combat jobs would become more lax, and women would not have privacy for their \"bodily functions.\"\n\nIn a book on civilian-military relations, co-edited with Kori Schake, Mattis warned of the danger of civilian leaders with a \"progressive agenda.\" His book also warns that \"an uninformed public is permitting political leaders to impose an accretion of social conventions that are diminishing the combat power of our military.\"\n\nThat's an opinion Maginnis agrees with.\n\n\"Political appointees have a lot of political persuasion,\" Maginnis said. \"They are essentially political animals kowtowing to their political masters who have an agenda.\"\n\n\"I think the seriousness Mattis will bring to this building will be translated through every policy we begin to execute,\" Maginnis said. \"I think he will put a stamp on the organization that will be positive \u2013 no more political correctness, just a focus on being warriors.\"\n\nIn addition to facing the normal confirmation process, Mattis needs a waiver from the legal requirement to have been out of uniform for seven years before accepting a political appointment.\n\nPresident-elect Trump also appointed Florida Panthers owner and billionaire Vincent Viola as secretary of the Army. Viola, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., achieved the rank of major in the U.S. Army Reserves, but has spent much of his career as one of the nation's foremost leaders in electronic trading. That career background contrasts to that of current Army Secretary Eric Fanning, most of whose work has been in the public sector and is the first openly gay head of any branch of the U.S. military.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.2158055305481, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 846, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.62953905049, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.01891252955083, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/30/long-sought-attack-signal-in-type-1-diabetes-identified.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Long-sought 'attack' signal in type 1 diabetes identified  ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 718, "date": "20161230140000", "story_content": "In people with type 1 diabetes, the body wages a ruthless campaign of destruction against certain cells in the pancreas because it mistakes them for foreign invaders. Now, one of the long-sought triggers of this assault might have been found, according to a new study from Switzerland.\n\nThe cells that are destroyed, called beta cells, normally produce certain proteins in packages called exosomes. The new study found that, when the cells are in trouble, such as after an infection or other stressful event, these packages are decorated with chemical warning signals that may act as homing beacons that lure immune cells.\n\n\"When beta cells are subjected to stress, the exosomes are released at higher levels and now contain proteins that signal danger to alert the immune system,\" said study author Steinunn Baekkeskov, a biochemist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nThe new findings could provide a means to shut off the wayward immune system, thereby preventing the development of type 1 diabetes in people who are at very early stages of the disease, the study authors suggested.\n\nNormally, beta cells release the hormone insulin , which helps body cells take in sugar from the bloodstream. People with type 1 diabetes , whose beta cells are destroyed, must inject insulin into their bodies, or they will die. Those with the disease constantly monitor their blood sugar and take many doses of insulin each day to regulate their blood sugar.\n\nBut even with these treatments, blood sugar levels that frequently run too high and too low mean that people with the condition face an increased risk of complications such as kidney failure, heart disease and nerve damage.\n\nIn an ongoing, decades-long study, scientists have monitored the family members of people with type 1 diabetes (who are at increased risk of developing it themselves), and found evidence that the autoimmune assault begins before people show symptoms. Early on in the course of the disease, people may have high levels of certain antibodies that bind to pancreatic proteins found in the beta cells. If a person tests positive for two or more antibodies to these proteins, it virtually guarantees that he or she will develop the disease eventually, even if the person has no symptoms for years, according to a 2015 study in the journal Diabetes Care .\n\nThese findings have raised researchers' hopes of intervening early, to shut off the immune attack in people with antibodies before too many beta cells are killed, Baekkeskov said.\n\n\"Antibody-positive individuals, who have not yet developed clinical disease, are candidates for immune preventive therapy to block beta-cell destruction and prevent the development of type 1 diabetes,\" Baekkeskov told Live Science in an email.\n\nBut researchers still didn't know how these beta-cell proteins first encountered the immune cells that trigger autoimmunity.\n\nTo answer that question, Baekkeskov and her colleagues analyzed the exosomes from both human and rat beta cells. They found that the exosomes carried the beta-cell proteins recognized by the antibodies. In addition, these exosomes seemed to attract immune cells and activate them, she said.\n\nWhat's more, when the cells were under stress, the exosomes were decorated with chaperone proteins, or special molecules that take newly made proteins and help them fold or travel through the cell to their final destination, Baekkeskov said.\n\nHowever, in this case, the chaperone proteins were not benign; they acted as a flashing emergency light that signals danger to the immune system. From there, immune molecules flag the molecules as dangerous, the researchers hypothesized in the Nov. 21 issue of the journal Diabetes .\n\nIt's possible that inflammation , such as the response to an infection or other assault, stresses the beta cells and causes them to release exosomes marked with these warning signals, the researchers said.\n\nAt that point, the immune system launches an unrelenting assault, and the immune system's long memory makes it very hard to shut off the attack. (However, the study doesn't address whether there may be many other initial triggers for beta-cell destruction.)\n\nThe new findings suggest a way to reprogram the immune system. One possibility would be to engineer an exosome mimic that can lure immune cells to them. These exosomes could be covered with chemical signals that lure the beta-cell-killing immune cells and block or kill them, Baekkeskov said.\n\nOriginal article on Live Science.\n\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.942590236663821, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 688, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.22680885708, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 6, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161230140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.1802325581395303, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/18/study-illinois-women-prison-treats-inmates-too-harshly.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [77]}}, "headline": "Study: Illinois women's prison treats inmates too harshly", "wordcount_as_scraped": 655, "date": "20161118170000", "story_content": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2013 \u00a0Inmates at Illinois' major women's prison have been called \"crazy\" and \"worthless\" by corrections officers, are sometimes placed in an unpadded open-bar \"crisis cage\" and receive harsher discipline than men for similar offenses, a study released Friday says.\n\nThe federally funded review conducted for the Illinois Department of Corrections found that the mostly nonviolent women at Logan Correctional Center in Lincoln are often classified as higher security risks than necessary, which needlessly extends their stays.\n\nSegregation is overused as a punishment and the women get few chances to prepare for community re-entry, contributing to a recidivism rate of 50 percent \u2014 higher than the state's prison population as a whole, according to the report.\n\nThe National Resource Center on Justice Involved Women's assessment is harshly critical of the 2013 decision by former Gov.

Ninety-eight percent of imprisoned Illinois women have experienced physical abuse, 75 percent have been sexually abused, and 85 percent have encountered emotional abuse.

In interviews, staff members called inmates \"crazy,\" ''worthless,\" and said they \"talk too much,\" resulting in more discipline and good-conduct credit days taken away. But women are more relational and prefer to discuss things, as opposed to men, who tend to shut down, Collins said.\n\nAnd women often don't relate well to prison security staff because they were typically at odds with authorities on the street, said Colette Payne, who spent five stints in prison beginning at age 14 and was part of the assessment team.\n\n\"If I've been raped and you are yelling at me like my abuser, I see you as that person,\" said the 49-year-old who now runs a support group for former women inmates. \"I'm looking at you like you're my abuser, that's where they tension comes in, so I'm going to fight or shut down.\"\n\nPayne was shocked to see the use of the so-called \"crisis cage,\" where women are placed in a stand-alone cell without privacy or padding; the department has pledged to replace it.\n\nThe report notes that inmates making \"crisis calls,\" in which they feel a threat to themselves, increased dramatically from early 2014 to late 2015, and monthly suicide attempts increased tenfold since the Logan consolidation.\n\nThe report praises the state Corrections Department for agreeing on necessary change and constructing a mental-health unit at the prison.\n\nDeanne Benos, a former Corrections assistant director whose Chicago-based Women's Justice Initiative coordinated the project, said one reason Illinois succeeded in the competitive grant process was Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's criminal justice reform pledge. He wants to reduce the prison population by 25 percent by 2025.\n\n\"Meaningful changes can be made with limited resources ...\" Benos said. \"Even changing some of the rules and operational practices at Logan can have a dramatic impact on the facility.\"\n\n___\n\nContact Political Writer John O'Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor.

Jeff Sessions to serve as the 84th Attorney General of the United States\u2014and he couldn't have made a better choice.\u00a0 Throughout his career, Sessions has demonstrated unshakable commitment and fidelity to the Constitution, the rule of law, and protecting the freedom and liberty that is our birthright as Americans.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHe has almost the perfect professional background to be the attorney general.\u00a0 As the former U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of Alabama under President Ronald Reagan, he gained practical experience in the most important prosecutorial work that the Justice Department is supposed to do every day: enforce the criminal and civil statutes of the United States.\u00a0\n\nThat is something that the Justice Department has neglected to do in a number of areas\u2014such as immigration\u2014under the leadership of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch.\u00a0 In fact, Sessions' most difficult job will be reversing the unprofessionalism and downright unethical conduct that has infected parts of the Department in recent years, the result of decision-making being driven by politics rather than a commitment to uphold the law.\n\nWhile many lawyers have the kind of practical experience Sessions gained as a prosecutor, not many have been a state attorney general.\u00a0 It is that experience that helps make Sessions the best choice.\u00a0 As the former attorney general of Alabama, Sen. Sessions won't have a lengthy learning curve; he already has the administrative experience of running a law enforcement agency.\u00a0 More importantly, he has a keen appreciation of the fact that we are a federal republic, which means that state governments are independent sovereigns, not provincial subdivisions of the federal government.\u00a0\n\nThose who believe in a \"living\" Constitution look on state sovereignty as an anachronistic anomaly that must be crushed.\u00a0 In a time where we face a federal government that has expanded its power far outside the boundaries set by the Constitution, often with the help of the U.S. Supreme Court, having an attorney general who believes in the limited government intended by our Founders and respects the sovereignty of local governments is essential to preserving our freedoms, our liberties, and our constitutional republic.\n\nSessions' experience as a U.S. senator also gives him a valuable perspective on the job at Justice.\u00a0 He understands and appreciates the importance of the constitutional oversight role of Congress.\u00a0 This is important given the dismissive and contemptuous attitude displayed by former Attorney General Eric Holder and other Obama political appointees towards congressional oversight.\u00a0\n\nIt was that attitude that eventually made Holder the first attorney general in history to be held in contempt by the House of Representatives. The action resulted from his refusal to provide Congress with information about Operation Fast & Furious, the most reckless law enforcement operation ever conducted by the Justice Department.\u00a0 One thing we know for sure: no such operation would ever have been conducted under Attorney General Sessions.\n\nFinally, Sen. Sessions is battle-tested. He has shown that he will stand up to the vicious and spiteful lies cast by the Left in the heat of political fights over constitutional principles.\u00a0 When Sessions was nominated by President Reagan to be a federal district court judge, he was the target of a malicious campaign. Then-senators Joe Biden and Ted Kennedy, aided and abetted by left-wing activists inside the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, pounded him relentlessly with trumped up accusations of racism. Unfortunately, their smear campaign was successful, and Session's nomination was voted down by Democrats in the Judiciary Committee.\n\nBut Sessions refused to wither under the venomous attacks. He went back to Alabama and campaigned to become the state's attorney general. After winning that election, he ran for\u2014and won\u2014the U.S. Senate seat.\u00a0 In the ultimate political revenge, he ended up on the Senate Judiciary Committee sitting next to some of the senators who engineered his defeat.\u00a0 His resolve to stand his ground and fight in the face of false and relentless media attacks is an essential requirement for any conservative who serves as U.S. attorney general.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions will be the first attorney general of the United States from the great state of Alabama, my home state.\u00a0 I have no doubt that he will do the job that needs to be done \u2013 restore the professionalism and unbiased administration of justice that should be the hallmark of the U.S. Justice Department.\u00a0 Roll Tide!\n\n\n\nHans A. von Spakovsky is a Senior Legal Fellow at The Heritage Foundation and former Justice Department official.

My advice to the president-elect tonight is, be very careful. In the case of Romney, Trump should remember all of the vicious, nasty and horrible things the 1012 GOP presidential nominee said about him earlier this year when he sought to sabotage Trump's campaign.\n\nTRUMP WANTS TO BE \"PRESIDENT OF ALL THE PEOPLE\"\n\n\"If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished,\" Romney said. \"Now, Donald Trump tells us that he is very, very smart. I'm afraid that when it comes to foreign policy, he is very, very not smart.\n\n\"Dishonesty is Donald Trump's hallmark,\" Romney continued, before calling Trump \"a phony, a fraud,\" whose \"promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.\"\n\nMr. Trump, do you really want him in your Cabinet?\n\nThen there's Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago. He has deep political ties to President Obama, and of course, the Clintons. Yet, there he was at Trump Tower this week, playing nice only a few weeks after declaring he will oppose Trump's plan to enforce federal law by ending sanctuary cities.\n\nAnd what exactly was global warming alarmist and former Vice President Gore doing at Trump Tower earlier this week? In October, Gore warned us all that Trump would \"take us toward a climate catastrophe.\" He has long accused Republicans of being racists who want the poor to drink dirty water and breathe polluted air.\n\nFinally, what are we to make of Trump telling the \"Today\" show Wednesday about his budding relationship with the current commander-in-chief?\n\n\"I've now gotten to know President Obama,\" Trump said. \"I really like him. We have, I think I can say at least for myself -- I can't speak for him, but we have a really good chemistry together. We talk. He loves the country.\u00a0 He wants to do right by the country and for the country. And I will tell you, we obviously very much disagree on certain policies and certain things, but you know, I really like him as a person.\"\n\nThe office of president deserves respect, but the fact is, President Obama has been one of the worst presidents in American history. Trump is taking the high road to bring the country together. But it is pretty obvious to me that President Obama is putting on a front. Fox News' Ed Henry reported that Obama is planning a farewell tour in mid-January, with major speeches in up to three cities. The likely goal: To undermine Donald Trump before the inauguration.\n\nObama has been harsh in his criticism of Trump, and there's no doubt that will continue long after he leaves office. He is a divisive, radical left-wing ideologue, always was, always will be.\n\n\"This is somebody who's spent 70 years on this earth showing no respect for working people,\" Obama said of Trump during the campaign. \"This is somebodies who vilifies minorities, vilifies immigrants, vilifies people of Muslim faith. If you disrespect women before you are elected president, you will disrespect women when you're in office.\"\n\nThe Republican leadership in Washington is finally coming around to supporting Donald Trump. But I'm an old Reagan guy, and I think it's worth remembering his admonition, his famous line, \"Trust but verify.\"\n\nWashington might seem like a nice place, but as Trump has said, it's really a swamp. And as soon as things get even a little bit tough, these newfound friends from the political class will turn on him on a dime.\n\nPresident Harry Truman is often quoted as saying, \"If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.\" President-elect Trump is reportedly set to get a first pup named \"Patton.\" That will make one friend. If he wants another, he should get Patton a playmate.\n\nAdapted from Sean Hannity's monologue airing on \"Hannity\" Dec. 7, 2016\n\n\n\nSean Hannity currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) Hannity (weekdays 10-11PM/ET).

It's only a matter of time until you catch that bug making its way from one end of your workplace to the other. But luckily, whether or not you get sick doesn't have to be left completely up to chance. There are some things you can do to help keep you from suffering the same snotty fate as your co-workers\u2014though, you can never be 100 percent in the clear.\n\nFirst, you need to accept the reality of the situation: Germs spread like wildfire in an office or other common space. \"When people sneeze, cough or even talk, they are spreading little droplets that can contain influenza and other viruses,\" Romney M. Humphries, Ph.D., section chief of clinical microbiology and an assistant professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, tells SELF. These droplets become airborne and then settle on surfaces. Depending on what virus or bacteria a person has, you may not even need to interact with them to catch their germs in a shared space. Some bacteria and viruses, like the flu, for example, can survive on hard surfaces for at least a day, Humphries says. \"Other viruses and bacteria don't do well once they are outside the human body, and die quickly in the environment.\"\n\nInstead of accepting that you'll just become sick and miserable, here are six things you can do to avoid getting sick when everyone you know is.\n\n1. Wash your hands more.\n\n\"This is the best way to remove germs, avoid getting sick, and prevent spread of germs to others,\" Humphries says. (Follow these steps to make sure you're doing it effectively.) The goal is to kill any germs you touch before they make their way to your mucous membranes\u2014eyes and nose\u2014where they can set up shop and make you ill. If you can't get up and wash your hands easily throughout the day, \"using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a good alternative,\" says Humphries.\n\n2. Avoid touching your face.\n\nSpecifically, your eyes and nose. Touching germs and then these areas gives said germs easy access into your body. So wash those hands and avoid the temptation to touch to make it harder for them to find an entry point.\n\n3. Wipe down your work surface.\n\n\"This will help prevent the buildup of germs and reduce the chances of you getting exposed,\" Humphries explains. Use a disinfecting wipe to clean off your workspace twice a day in the middle of flu season.\n\n4. Get vaccinated.\n\nThis only helps with the flu, not a cold or other random viruses. But the flu is kind of a big deal. \"This is the easiest, most effective way to protect yourself against getting sick,\" Humphries says. \"Flu vaccines cause your body to make antibodies against the flu. It's important to get vaccinated annually, because the flu viruses change a lot year-to-year, and last year's vaccine will not protect you.\" It's still possible to get the flu if you've been vaccinated, but it's often much milder.\n\n5. Get more sleep.\n\nHaving a healthy immune system that helps your body fight off invading germs is another important way to stay healthy. \"In general, trying to live a healthy lifestyle can improve your immune system and help prevent you from getting sick,\" Humphries says. One important part of that is getting enough sleep. \"The number one thing you could be doing is getting enough sleep,\" Anthony Lyon, M.D., medical director of The Ash Center in NYC, tells SELF. When you don't prioritize sleep and push yourself too hard, your body is less prepared to fight back against bacteria and viruses, and you get sick more easily. If you're a restless sleeper or have trouble winding down at night, Lyon suggests practicing deep-breathing meditation.\n\n6. And remember that healthy habits = healthy life.\n\nEating healthy and exercising regularly can also have a positive impact on your immune system and put you in the best position possible to stay healthy. So when everyone around you is ill, let that be a reminder to keep up with your fitness routine (yes, even when it's cold outside) and fueling your body for the good fight. Don't overdo it, though. Pushing yourself too hard can actually run down your immune system and make you more susceptible\u2014so no two-a-days, OK?\n\nEven if you do all of these things, chances are you're not going to make it through these months completely unscathed. Humphries points out that this is especially true if you have kids. If and when you do get sick, focus on taking care of yourself (read: lots of sleep and tea) and don't be afraid to use your sick days if you have them. \"Taking the time off to get better will help you get better sooner and miss less work in the long run,\" says Humphries.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.26182961463928, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 792, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.9541957835000003, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 10, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161118110000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.77777777777778, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/11/14/check-again-with-your-doctor-about-statins-experts-say.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4537]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 679, "scraper_regex": 728}}, "headline": "Check again with your doctor about statins, experts say", "wordcount_as_scraped": 728, "date": "20161114210000", "story_content": "If you are middle-aged and have even one risk factor for cardiovascular disease, you might need statins to prevent a future stroke or heart attack, according to new recommendations from the government-backed U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).\n\nIn past recommendations, USPSTF focused on who should get testing for cholesterol and triglycerides. Now, it says all adults ages 40 to 75 should get screened for high cholesterol and some of them should receive statins to prevent future cardiovascular disease.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the USPSTF, Dr. Doug Owens from Stanford University in California told Reuters Health by email, \"Cardiovascular disease is serious - it can lead to heart attacks and strokes, and is responsible for one in every three adult deaths in the U.S.\"\n\n\"People with no signs or symptoms and no past history of cardiovascular disease can still be at risk, and a medication called statins can help reduce that risk,\" he said. \"The Task Force recommends that people who have a high risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years, as calculated by their doctor, and who have a risk factor including high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or are a smoker, should consider taking a statin. In addition, people with a lower risk may also benefit from taking a daily statin.\"\n\n\"It's important that those who have concerns about their risk of developing cardiovascular disease talk to their primary care doctor to determine whether taking statins for prevention would be beneficial for them,\" Owens said.\n\nHe added, \"Regardless of your risk for heart disease, everyone can lower the chance that they will have a heart attack or stroke by not smoking, eating a healthy diet, engaging in physical activity, and limiting alcohol use. Managing high blood pressure and high cholesterol and taking aspirin when indicated can also help.\"\n\nThe new USPSTF recommendations appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association, along with a review of the evidence supporting them and several editorials expressing contrasting views about how best to use statins in this setting.\n\nDr. Roger Chou from Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, who coauthored the evidence review, told Reuters Health by email, \"Statins reduce the risk of first heart attack, stroke, or death in persons with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol.\"\n\nHe noted that people are often concerned with side effects of statins, which can include muscle pain, liver problems, memory issues, or diabetes. But the evidence review found no increase in risk for these problems in people taking statins, compared to the risks in people taking dummy pills.\n\n\"Further,\" he said, \"most side effects if they do occur will resolve when the statin is stopped - but results of heart attacks and strokes can be permanent or fatal.\"\n\nDr. Rita F. Redberg from the University of California, San Francisco, who coauthored one of the editorials, questioned the strength of the evidence, particularly with regard to the balance between benefits and risks of statin treatment. She told Reuters Health by email, \"Be sure you understand your own chance of benefit, as most people taking statins will never see a benefit from them.\"\n\n\"Even the most optimistic calculations about statins say that of 100 people who take statins for five years, two will avoid a heart attack and 98 will have no benefit,\" she explained. \"Yet, approximately five to 20 of those 100 people will experience adverse effects, including muscle aches, memory loss or brain fog, diabetes, fatigue, and/or weakness.\"\n\n\"The best way to stay healthy is not by taking a statin, but by working on healthy lifestyle habits,\" Redberg said. \"Unfortunately, data show that in the last decade people that take statins are more likely to gain weight and be less active than people who do not take a statin, perhaps due to a false reassurance from taking a statin.\"\n\nBut Dr. Paul D. Thompson from Hartford Hospital in Connecticut, who also wrote about statin-associated side effects, told Reuters Health by email, \"I have made a career on examining statin-associated adverse effects and have umpteen papers on the topic, but am convinced they do not affect the majority of patients, and I never miss my statin despite my career interest!\"\n\nThe bottom line: USPSTF says you should see your doctor to discuss these recommendations and find out whether they apply to you.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.7667984962463397, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 679, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.79018350059, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 6, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5346097201767304, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2016/12/03/actress-sonia-braga-stars-in-aquarius-serious-oscar-contender/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [90], "\u00e7": [223, 1900]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 839, "scraper_regex": 911}}, "headline": "Actress Sonia Braga stars in 'Aquarius' -- a serious Oscar contender     ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 911, "date": "20161203220000", "story_content": "NEW YORK (AP)  \u2013 \u00a0While female actors are fighting for more and better roles in Hollywood, Sonia Braga got the part of her life at 66 in Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho's \"Aquarius\".\n\nThe Brazilian star is getting rave reviews for her portrayal of Clara, a widow and retired music critic reluctant to sell the seaside apartment that holds her most cherished memories. \"Ms. Braga is a living embodiment of the glories of Brazilian cinema,\" said The New York Times. \"A breathtakingly intuitive actress, she's beautifully aged into an aristocratically sensual physicality, and makes Clara's firmness mingle with tenderness,\" said Variety.\n\n\"When I got the screenplay it was one of the most beautiful gifts I was getting in my whole life,\" Braga told The Associated Press in a recent interview in New York, where she lives. \"I was reading the best screenplay that I ever read.

Well, I didn't call him IMMEDIATELY because I had to breathe before I could call.\"\n\n\"Aquarius \" debuted last May at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was the only Latin American production competing for the Palm d'Or, and was recently nominated for an Independent Spirit Award. Although many considered it a natural contender for the foreign film Oscar, Brazil submitted David Schurmann's \"Little Secret\" instead, reportedly because of the \"Aquarius\" cast's protest against the interim administration of Brazil's Michel Temer at Cannes.\n\nBraga said she and her cast-mates had no regrets about the protest and that she would do it over again without question. As Mendon\u00e7a Filho put it, \"Aquarius,\" which had a limited U.S. release in October and is still opening in different cities around the country, represents Brazil, regardless.\n\nBraga talks more about the film, and her life:\n\nAP: In the film Clara has gone through a lot, including breast cancer, yet she can be as subtle as strong. How was it to play such a complex character?\n\nBraga: Clara and I would come from different places: she is academic, I am intuitive; she has a family and I'm not married, I don't have kids. So we had a lot to negotiate, but the basics of the character, it was there. So we're talking, Clara and I, but at the same time we are commemorating this opportunity that Kleber was giving us to play this for the audiences.\n\nAP: Kleber said you were very generous with the cast and crew and that you were delighted to work with non-actors.\n\nBraga: He said, \"Sonia, there's something that I need to tell you: sometimes I work with non-actors\". And I said, \"Really? That's fantastic! Because I'm not an actress either!\" He said, \"What do you mean?\" ''I'm scared of rehearsals, I'm scared of doing all this because I don't feel like I'm an actress. I never went to school for actors, I'm not academic, as a matter of fact academic actors intimidate me a little bit, so you are gonna work with people!\" The way I see it, I belong to the film as any other department. I like visual arts, and what I love doing is participating in the making of it.\n\nAP: It is very refreshing to see an actress leading in her 60s. Do you hope it will open the doors to more and better female roles?\n\nBraga: Well, the doors are there, and they closed. A reporter told me it is very rare to see a woman of my age in the movies. Right! In the movies! But they have been for so long in very serious and important positions in life: scientists, prime ministers, candidates to be the president. ... There is a barrier with the languages also, and with the accents as well. Today we find many actors, they are Latin, they are Hispanic, they are living in the Unites States, they are American, but very rarely you find them in a lead role.\n\nAP: It is evident from the movie how comfortable you feel in your own skin.\n\nBraga: I did things in the movie that I usually don't do and that had a little anxiety about: I had to sing and I can't sing, unfortunately. I can't play the piano, and I cannot swim. But sex, I think I've been there before (laughs.) It's not so difficult to do. ... To be naked or even making love in a scene to me is very important if this is a movie about a couple or sensuality. It's a sort of moralism to think that this shouldn't be seen in the film. When was it that people decided as a society that your body is in one place and your sexuality in another place, something like a hat, or a coat, that when you leave home you hang it and when you come back home you say, \"Ah! Let's wear my sexuality! I might wear it tonight\"? It is something that belongs to your body. Women at my age they are making love, they are feeling sensual, they flirt, they have boyfriends, they have a sexual life. They are just not being represented in the movies.\n\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.49253726005554, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 839, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.2398346997299998, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161203220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4302741358760402, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/19/hard-times-for-puerto-rico-family-child-with-zika-defect.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [83, 491, 498, 3197, 3204, 3667, 3674, 3968, 3975]}}, "headline": "Hard times for Puerto Rico family of child with Zika defect", "wordcount_as_scraped": 827, "date": "20161219130000", "story_content": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2013 \u00a0Michelle Flandez had just given birth to her first son, but doctors in this U.S. territory whisked him away before she could see him.\n\nPerplexed, she demanded him back and then slowly unwrapped the blanket that covered him.\n\n\"My husband and I looked at each other,\" she recalled. \"No one had warned us. No one had given us the opportunity to decide what to do.\"\n\nIt was mid-October, and in her arms lay what\u00a0health\u00a0officials announced as the first known baby born in Puerto Rico with a rare birth defect that has been linked to the mosquito-borne Zika virus. Those with microcephaly have abnormally small heads and often suffer impeded brain growth and other problems.\n\nThe island, already struggling with a shortage of doctors and funds amid a worsening economic crisis, has more than 35,700 Zika cases, including nearly 3,000 involving pregnant women. Some 300 people overall have been hospitalized and five have died, including at least two who developed complications from a paralysis condition linked to Zika known as Guillain-Barre.\n\nSince the birth of Flandez's son, named Inti after an Inca sun god, four other babies have been born in Puerto Rico with birth defects linked to Zika, including microcephaly. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has projected a surge in cases next year. A study by the CDC estimates that up to 10,300 pregnant women in Puerto Rico could be infected with Zika and that between 100 and 270 babies could be born with microcephaly. The U.S. mainland, meanwhile, has reported more than 30 cases of birth defects linked to Zika.\n\nWhile Flandez had symptoms of Zika early in her pregnancy, she said she was told that tests showed a false positive. Sonograms in August and September showed no problems.\n\nFlandez ran a finger through the silky dark hair on Inti's tiny head on Friday as she described the challenges of raising her 3-month-old son on an island in economic crisis. She called several pediatric neurologists after he was born and found just one who accepted Medicaid. The earliest appointment she could get was in October 2017.\n\nDiscouraged, she turned to relatives, one of whom detailed the family's plight on Facebook: \"The family has remained quiet for too long. If this message reaches a pediatric neurologist who can help Inti, we will be more than grateful.\"\n\nThe post was shared 11,000 times, and shortly afterward, an official at Puerto Rico's largest public hospital called and arranged an appointment for Inti. Since then, he has received therapy and now has several appointments scheduled through February with other doctors.\n\nBut hardships persist. Flandez does not have a car, and she sometimes has to walk an hour with Inti to reach the closest bus stop when neighbors or friends cannot drive her to the doctor. Money also is tight for Flandez and her husband, who live in a two-bedroom apartment with no couch.\n\n\"I have to pay rent, I have to eat ... I have to pay for transportation,\" she said as she cradled a sleepy Inti after breastfeeding him.\n\nExperts fear babies like Inti could develop other disabilities as they grow, burdening a\u00a0health\u00a0care system already breaking under an exodus of doctors fleeing for the U.S. mainland. The cost of treating a baby with Zika is estimated at $3.8 million, said Dr. Cynthia Moore, director of the CDC's division of congenital and developmental disorders. She said a Zika infection can bring many consequences, including poor eyesight or motor skills.\n\n\"The more we learn about it, the more we find new problems,\" she said. \"It's rapidly evolving.\"\n\nIn Puerto Rico,\u00a0health\u00a0officials are pushing to secure more federal funds to fight the Zika epidemic, even as the number of weekly new cases has been dropping. Some of that money might be used as a special bonus for doctors who normally don't accept Medicaid patients, said Dr. Miguel Valencia Prado, director of the\u00a0Health\u00a0Department's Division of Children with Special Medical Needs.\n\nIn addition, Valencia said he has established videoconferencing with at least two specialists in the U.S. who serve as consultants, and he is considering requesting that doctors based in the U.S. temporarily work in Puerto Rico on a rotational basis.\n\nMeanwhile, Flandez said she is taking it day-by-day with Inti, whom his older sister has nicknamed \"Starman\" because, as she explained to her mother, he is different from the rest and thus comes from the stars.\n\nInti likes to have his feet tickled by the family's cat \u2014 \"She's our emergency therapist,\" the mother says \u2014 and he seems to be soothed by the music of Iron Maiden songs when he cries, Flandez said with a laugh.\n\n\"He's a normal child. I don't see him as someone for whom you should have pity,\" she said. \"You never know how long he's going to live or how long I'm going to live. The most important thing is to do what's best right now.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.3542602062225297, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 794, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.48268240275, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161219130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.7632241813602, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/12/02/home-or-street-for-christmas-texas-family-falls-prey-to-wrap-around-mortgage/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [480, 2807]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1180, "scraper_regex": 1258}}, "headline": "Home or street for Christmas? Texas family falls prey to wrap-around mortgage scam", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1258, "date": "20161202190000", "story_content": "A family with three children may have to leave their home before Christmas because of a wrap-around mortgage scam.\n\nMore than a year ago, Santa Martinez and Michael Moreno were living with their three kids in a small apartment when they got excited about a tempting offer: a four-bedroom house, 10K down, no credit, bad credit OK, the poster read.\n\nIt was exactly what they wanted, so they called. \u00a0\n\n\"We had been saving for eight years for a moment like this, especially to have a house of our own,\" Moreno told Fox News.\n\nThey said they spoke on the phone with a real estate agent named Victor Dennis, to whom they later gave the $10,000 down payment and then $1,270 a month for the home.\n\n\"We had no credit and no going through hassle of banks, so we thought it would be easy,\" said Martinez. \"So we decided to go for it because we had that money saved.\"\n\nThey started making payments in October of 2015.\n\nBut when Moreno and Martinez bought the house from Dennis, they did not know the mortgage from the previous homeowner had not been paid off. The house went in foreclosure and on June 14th they received a notice saying they had three days to vacate.\n\nThey would later find out that Dennis used a wrap-around mortgage scam to sell them the house from the original owner.\n\n\"We may end up being evicted from our own house just because of this man,\" said Moreno. \"He ended up being a con artist who kept all the money in his pocket.\"\n\nA wrap-around mortgage is when the seller's mortgage is kept on the home when the new buyers take ownership. A second mortgage is often taken out to cover equity the home may have gained or to help the buyer make some money on interest. Wrap-around mortgages can be helpful for people with bad credit because they don't have the same requirements with banks that traditional mortgages have.\n\nMartinez and Moreno are not alone. In an effort to crack down on wrap-around mortgage scams, catch culprits and help victims, a Texas state senator along with other officials have created a joint task force to combat the problem. Since the start of the task force \u2013 which includes multiple state and federal agencies, including the FBI - in October, more victims have come forward.\n\nPeople often get scammed and lose the house when a middleman makes a promise to the homeowner to sell the home and handle the mortgage. Instead, the middleman doesn't handle the mortgage; the person just sells the house, pockets the down payment and monthly payments from the buyer and lets the mortgage fall into foreclosure. Because the scams result in foreclosure, they impact not just the buyer but the seller as well. The seller's credit is destroyed after the mortgage defaults and they often don't know. \u00a0\n\nAccording to State Senator Jose Rodriguez, victims in Texas are typically military families and immigrants. Military families get reassigned frequently and need to sell their home at a moment's notice, so they trust the scammer at their word to handle the mortgage and the sale.\n\nImmigrant families often don't have good enough credit to qualify for a traditional mortgage so they too are enticed by a good deal and are duped into believing the house will be theirs for a great price. He said those two vulnerable groups are why El Paso is a target for scammers.\n\n\"Scam artists promise to take care of the mortgage and sell the house for the prior owners,\" said Rodriguez. \"Instead, they walk away with thousands of dollars by selling it again and letting the first mortgage fall into foreclosure.\"\n\nIn July, the Texas' Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending issued a cease-and-desist order to three of the biggest offenders. According to the order, although they had been servicing mortgages to homebuyers, they were not and had never been a residential mortgage loan originator as is required by Texas code. One of the accused offenders was Victor Dennis. He did not appeal.\n\nIn addition to the cease-and-desist order, Dennis has lost two civil cases and there's another one pending. District Court judges ruled against him on claims including common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and promissory estoppel. The judges said Dennis lied to people to get them to buy a home, he knew he was lying, and the reason his victims bought the homes was because they believed his lies.\n\nDennis was ordered to pay the money back to the plaintiffs and make sure the deeds to the homes they bought were officially put into their name. The third case waiting a decision is nearly identical to the first two.\n\nTexas Rio Grande Legal Aide (TRLA), an organization helping low-income families in South West and Central Texas with employment, family, civil rights and other legal issues, is involved in active litigation on more than 30 of these cases and has handled hundreds over the years. K-Sue Park is an attorney for TRLA Park and a member of the task force. She described Dennis as an egregious offender. According to Park, Dennis has scammed many, including Santa Martinez and Michael Moreno.\n\nThe Martinez Moreno family is still living in the home with the help of Park and TRLA; Park said the judge is allowing the family to stay in the home for the time being because they could prove they were making payments. Park also said they filed complaints with the Texas Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending and the Attorney General's office.\n\n\"We're very grateful to the judge who has seen this is not a normal eviction case,\" said Park. \"These people were paying the whole time they didn't even know the foreclosure had taken place. The judge has been very fair and listened to our arguments about that.\"\n\nAccording to attorneys, the original mortgage on the home was through Patriot Mortgage. After it went into default, the mortgage was taken over by PennyMac Loan Services.\n\nFox News reached out to PennyMac and learned that their records showed the house had been sold in June. When PennyMac learned of the case from Fox News, they immediately had their fraud team investigate. They have since reached out to the couple and offered to assist. The couple confirmed that PennyMac reached out to their attorney and offered to sell the home to them. The family and their attorney are unsure if a deal can be reached.\n\n\"We're sorry to hear the circumstances for these folks and to the extent that we can do the right thing we will,\" said Steve Hagey, PennyMac Financials media relations representative.\n\nPark said Dennis broke Texas Property Code by not informing the family or the previous owner and that there was an existing mortgage on the home at the time of the sale. She hopes Dennis will face criminal prosecution in the future.\n\nThe family has a court date Dec. 5th. During the hearing, the judge will hear a motion to change judges from PennyMac and a motion to compel by K-Sue Park on behalf of the family.\n\nAs for Martinez and Moreno, they're waiting to find out if they'll have to move. They said the children are extremely concerned about where they'll live when this is over.\n\n\"They ask almost daily: Mom, are we leaving already? Are they kicking us out already?\"\n\n\n\nRay Bogan is a Fox News multimedia reporter based in El Paso, Texas.

Still, Democrats and Republicans on Sunday spoke with some uncertainty about the anticipated outcome.\n\n\"We expect everything to fall in line,\" Reince Priebus, White House chief of staff in the incoming Trump administration, told \"Fox News Sunday.\"\u00a0\n\nElectors will convene in state capitals across the country Monday to make the results of the Nov. 8 election official. \u00a0\n\nIn most presidential election years, the Electoral College vote would essentially be a formality. But electors have been facing pressure for weeks from anti-Trump forces to upend the November results; protests also are expected at state capitals on Monday.\u00a0\n\nWhile the efforts stand little chance of succeeding, those factions have been fueled by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's win in the popular vote. She won roughly 2.6 million more ballots than Trump but lost the Electoral College vote.\n\nTrump got more Electoral College votes by winning many of the smaller, less-populated states in the Midwest and South, along with the big coastal state of Florida and traditionally Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump and Clinton also split the six most populous states.\n\nTrump needs 270 electoral votes Monday. And the state victories put him in line to get 306 of the 538 -- with each state getting one vote for each House and Senate member. The three remaining votes go to the District of Columbia. \u00a0\n\nPriebus, who still runs the Republican National Committee, which is trying to keep count of the apportioned or \"pledged\" votes, cited the only known and so-called \"faithless\" balloter, who lives in Texas and whose vote goes to Trump but plans to vote for another, yet-to-be-named Republican.\n\n\"But other than that, we're very confident that everything is going to be very smooth,\" said Priebus, noting a massive petition drive to get electoral voters to cast ballots against Trump and the alleged harassment of some of the voters, particularly in Arizona, where Trump won 49 percent of the vote, compared to 45 percent for Clinton, which entitles him to all 11 electoral votes.\n\nArizona elector Robert Graham told Fox News on Saturday that the 11 electors have received hundreds of thousands of emails telling them not to vote for Trump and that he's received information that some of the other 10 have been followed or have received a death threat.\n\n\"It's out of hand when you have such \u2026 a small group of people that is pushing so hard against millions if not hundreds of millions of people who still appreciate this whole system,\" said Graham, chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. \"The Electoral College is part of the Constitution.\"\n\nAll swore to party officials that they will back Trump, even though they're not legally bound to do so, and plan to hold to that pledge.\n\nTrump responded to the reports of elector harassment and intimidation Sunday.\u00a0\n\n\"If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names!\"\n\nThere is no federal law on electoral votes. Some states bind their voters -- often state party officials -- to the popular vote. But the penalties for violations are minor, such as being disqualified from future balloting.\n\nOn Sunday, John Podesta, Clinton campaign chairman, suggested that 37 electoral voters bound to Trump could defect, which would be enough to create at least a tie and send the vote to the GOP-controlled House, where Trump would still likely win.\n\nPodesta, as he has in recent days, pressed the argument on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that Russians hacking the emails of Democrats during the election led in part to Clinton's loss.\n\nHe also made a last-minute argument that members of the Electoral College should have an intelligence briefing about the hackings before voting Monday.\n\n\"I assume that our electors are going to vote for Hillary Clinton,\" Podesta said. \"But the question is whether there are 37 Republican electors who think that either there are open questions [about the purported Russian hackings] or that Donald Trump \u2026 is really unfit to be president. \u2026 And I guess we will know that \u2026 tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Associated Press tried to reach all 538 electors and was able to interview more than 330 of them. Many reported getting tens of thousands of emails, calls and letters asking them to vote against Trump.\n\nBut the canvass found overwhelming support for the system, and the nominee, among Republican electors. The AP found only one pledged to Trump who will refuse to vote for him but did not identify him as the voter in Texas.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.62703382968903, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 707, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.56405913946, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161219070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4144271570014098, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/12/30/not-for-sale-highly-touted-electronics-that-missed-market-in-2016.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a9": [7225], "\u00a0": [175, 2382, 2951, 3089, 3099, 3187, 3340, 3478, 3610, 3691, 3714, 3830, 3993, 4029, 4036, 4077, 4085, 4094, 4126, 4133, 4324, 4339, 4708, 4911, 5049, 5191, 5429, 5743, 6046, 6061, 6213, 6360, 6403, 6515, 6542, 6603, 6836, 7026, 7045, 7100]}}, "headline": "Not for Sale: The Highly Touted Electronics That Missed the Market in 2016", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1195, "date": "20161230210000", "story_content": "What did 16-year-old Josh Joseph want for the holidays?

A company with such wealth and scale should be able to consistently deliver on time, and it's disappointing whenever they don't.\"\n\nJoseph was hardly alone. Though a limited quantity of the AirPods made it to market a couple of days before Christmas, a number of other high-profile products announced this fall, including the Samsung Galaxy Note7 smartphone and the GoPro Karma drone, weren't available for holiday shoppers.\n\nJonathan Sweetwood, owner of Unique Camera (which sells a variety of audio, video, and photography equipment) in Wayne, N.J., explains that when a consumer decides on a product only to find out that it's not available, it complicates what should be a straightforward transaction. \"With some people it's, 'I've got to have the Apple AirPods,'\" Sweetwood says. \"But with others, we try to get down to the root of what their needs are and we try to find them a comparable product.\"\n\nWhat's behind these disappointing product launches? At least part of the blame goes to Wall Street.\n\nAccording to Jonathan Yarmis, a former electronics analyst with Gartner and now principal analyst with the Yarmis Group, the reason for these product delays is that with an eye toward the stock market's expectations, companies are compressing their product development cycles.\n\n\"Everybody now feels this incredible pressure to come to market quickly,\" he explains. \"We used to go to CES to find out what products were coming in the coming year. Now you go to CES to see what's coming on Tuesday.\"\n\nThough each product that wasn't available this holiday season followed its own path\u2014some were recalled because of safety problems, and others were merely delayed\u2014Yarmis sees a common theme: an accelerated product development cycle that leaves little time for testing and even less time to fix a problem once it's discovered.\u00a0\n\nWhen there's a glitch, Yarmis explains, it often results in finger pointing between competing factions within the company. \"You have two conflicting groups within an organization,\" he says. \"The marketing people who are saying 'Now! Yesterday!' and the product development guys who are saying, 'This isn't simply a matter of issuing a press release. There are technological challenges. There are testing challenges.'\"\n\nIncreasingly, Yarmis notes, the marketers are winning these intramural battles. What does that mean for you? \"The consumer is now the beta tester,\"\u00a0Yarmis says, half jokingly.\n\nAs for Joseph, he didn't give up on his quest to make 2016 the year of the AirPod. He searched a site called\u00a0iStockNow\u00a0and tracked down a pair at a nearby Apple Store at Long Island's Roosevelt Field Mall. \u00a0\n\nHere's a look at five \"woulda, coulda, shoulda\" products from late 2016 that stumbled on the path from introduction to consumers' hands.\n\nThe Product:\u00a0Samsung's top-of-the-line smartphone was introduced in August to compete with the iPhone 7 for this fall's phone upgraders.\n\nThe Problem:\u00a0Shortly after the introduction, reports began filtering in that the lithium-ion batteries in these phones had begun exploding. That\u00a0led to a recall, and then when replacement phones also started catching fire, to\u00a0a second, wider recall\u00a0that resulted in all of the phones being pulled from the market\u2014sending consumers to other models.\n\nThe Resolution:\u00a0After the recalls\u2014and a Federal Aviation Administration ban on Note7s on airplanes\u2014Samsung finally gave up on introducing a Note7 model, and even took measures to\u00a0make it impossible to use any Note7\u00a0phones\u00a0still in consumers' hands.\n\nThe Product:\u00a0Apple's\u00a0iPhone 7\u00a0was largely notable for what it\u00a0didn't\u00a0have: a traditional headphone jack. While Apple fans debated the dongle question, Apple expected that the AirPod wireless earbuds that it announced at the same time would resolve this issue.\u00a0\n\nThe Problem:\u00a0The iPhone 7 hit the market in October, but the Air Pods remained in limbo. The company kept quietly pushing back the street date. Apple hasn't specified a reason for the delay, and published reports speculated on causes ranging from problems with Bluetooth to manufacturing problems. An Apple spokesman referred us to this statement, issued by the company in October:\u00a0\"The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.\"\n\nThe Resolution:\u00a0Though a few lucky and/or resourceful Apple fans will get their AirPods this year, most users will have to wait until 2017.\n\nThe Product:\u00a0The Karma, which folds to fit in a backpack, was touted by many as the product that would make drones a mass-market phenomenon.\n\nThe Problem:\u00a0Three weeks after its mid-October introduction, GoPro received reports of several \"in-flight failures,\" a.k.a. drones falling out of the sky. The good news was that no injuries or property damage were associated with the failures. GoPro,\u00a0with little help from the FAA or the Consumer Product Safety Commission, neither of which claimed jurisdiction over this issue, began its own recall. (Unlike a recall backed by regulators, the GoPro effort lacked governmental authority behind the effort to remove the product from store shelves.)\n\nThe Resolution:\u00a0The Karma was an important product for the struggling company, so GoPro went the extra mile to appease the consumers it inconvenienced. In addition to a full refund, early adopters of the Karma also got a $300 camera from the company. The Karma is now expected to return to store shelves early in 2017.\u00a0\n\nThe Product:\u00a0This modestly priced personal flying machine was set to vie with the GoPro Karma for a share of the growing market of casual drone users.\n\nThe Problem:\u00a0Partly because of the Karma recall, demand for the Mavic Pro outstripped supply. The company failed to make its aggressive October launch date and\u00a0reportedly began shipping small quantities\u00a0of preordered drones in November. Later orders were subject to a backlog of around two months.\n\nThe Resolution:\u00a0Amazon currently lists the\u00a0release date for the product as Feb. 10, 2017.\n\nThe Product:\u00a0Call them AirPods for the fashion conscious. The Beats version of Apple's wireless earbuds, which share some technology with the AirPods, were also introduced in September and supposed to hit the market a month later.\n\nThe Problems:\u00a0The BeatsX seemed to share the same logistical issues\u2014and the same delays\u2014as the AirPods. The earbuds were scheduled to hit the market in mid-October, but that deadline has quietly slipped.\u00a0Apple now says the\u00a0BeatsX will be available in February.\n\nThe Resolution:\u00a0Dr. Dre undoubtedly has his pair already, but for the rest of us, the Beats X should be available in early 2017.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2005-2016 Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.

Elor Azaria, an Israeli army medic\u00a0who had been deployed to the West Bank at the age of 19, shot and killed the Palestinian attacker who lay wounded and motionless on the ground -- nearly 15 minutes after he tried to stab a soldier in Hebron. Azaria's supporters claimed the military made him into a scapegoat.\n\nThe country's president, Reuven Rivlin, has authority to issue pardons but has said he would wait for the legal process to run its course before making a decision.\n\nISRAEL DISPATCHES SPY CHIEF FOR SECRET MEETING WITH TRUMP\n\n\"I urge the people of\u00a0Israel to support The Israeli Defense Forces. The soldiers are our daughters\u00a0and sons,\" Netanyahu wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe three-judge panel ruled earlier Wednesday, \"He opened fire in violation of orders, the terrorist did not pose any threat.\"\n\nIn delivering her ruling, Col. Maya Heller systematically rejected all of Azaria's defense arguments. \"There is no question that the defendant shot from close range after aiming his gun at the terrorist's head and there is no dispute that by doing so he endangered the lives of those around him,\" she wrote.\n\nISRAELI MOSSAD LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD WOMEN\n\nThe judges added that Azaria was \"aware\" his actions would result in the loss of life, and it was his bullet that killed the wounded Palestinian. Despite\u00a0Azaria's supporters claiming senior Israel Defense Forces leaders, politicians, the media or public opinion could influence the ruling, Heller emphasized that \"the verdict is based solely on the evidence brought forth (in the trial).\"\n\nAzaria's parents, Charlie and Oshra, left their home in Ramla in the early morning and arrived at the court for the verdict, greeted by hundreds of people who had turned up to stand in solidarity with the IDF sergeant.\n\nAs Azaria entered the courtroom, people nearby clapped their hands while calling out expressions of support: \"We love you and God loves you,\" they shouted.\n\nAzaria's defense team vowed to take the case to the military court of appeals. This could drag the trial out for at least four more months and even longer if another appeal is filed to the Supreme Court.\n\nMany Israeli lawmakers, both from the left and the right, called to pardon Azaria. Some claimed the legal process against him was \"contaminated from the onset.\" According to Jewish Home party leader Naftali\u00a0Bennett, \"today a soldier was convicted like a criminal for killing a terrorist who tried to slaughter soldiers.\"\n\nDefense Minister Avigdor\u00a0Lieberman responded, \"This is a severe verdict. I ask we all respect the court's ruling and show restraint. What is important \u2013 despite the harsh verdict \u2013 is that the defense establishments help the family and this soldier. I call on the public not to lambaste the IDF and the defense establishment. We must respect the ruling.\"\n\nDuring the verdict reading, which lasted two and a half hours, violent fights started outside of the court, and hundreds of right-wing demonstrators who supported Azaria blocked one of the main roads in Tel Aviv. Police arrested two people.\n\nThe shooting, which took place in the morning hours of March 24,\u00a02016, and the tense moments leading up to it, were captured on video by a Palestinian human rights activist. The video footage, distributed to news organizations, ensured that the incident, which came amid a wave of Palestinian stabbings, drew international attention. Azaria was indicted on April 18\u00a0by the military court.\n\nIn the face of strong condemnation of Azaria's actions by top military brass including IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot and then-defense minister Moshe Ya'alon, far-right supporters and some politicians have accused the defense establishment of abandoning one of its own.\n\nRight-wing politicians and some celebrities rallied behind Azaria. His actions, they claimed, were justified by the barrage of Palestinian violence and the general atmosphere of alarm in Hebron, a city where hundreds of Israeli settlers, under heavy army protection, live among some 200,000 Palestinians.\n\nOn the other side stood serving members of the military establishment. Many of them said Azaria, who made far-right, anti-Palestinian postings on Facebook before joining the military, acted in cold blood and outside protocol.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.89060497283936, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 652, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 14, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.97304970607, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.75460122699387, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/07/recounts-barely-making-dent-in-election-results-trump-gains-in-wisconsin.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [221, 383, 959, 1041, 1289, 3075, 3478, 4822, 5755, 5859]}}, "headline": "Recounts barely making dent in election results; Trump gains in Wisconsin", "wordcount_as_scraped": 952, "date": "20161207150000", "story_content": "Statewide recounts in key 2016 battlegrounds are proceeding in fits and starts -- but doing little to change the math behind Donald Trump's victory.\u00a0\n\nIn Wisconsin, one of three states where Green Party candidate Jill Stein has sought a fresh tabulation, the president-elect has even gained on Hillary Clinton.\u00a0\n\nThe push for a recount in Pennsylvania, meanwhile, is awaiting a federal court's OK, and a similar effort in Michigan has run into new judicial turbulence. But while Trump narrowly defeated Clinton in all three states, the numbers trickling in look unlikely to call into question the Nov. 8 results.\n\n\"In any election, the actual change in the margin of votes is very, very low,\" Drew Spencer Penrose, legal director at FairVote, told FoxNews.com. \"For people hoping for a change in results, I wouldn't hold my breath.\"\n\nHere's a rundown of what is happening in each state:\u00a0\n\nWisconsin\n\nWith the Wisconsin Election Commission working since last Thursday \u2013\u00a0when Stein paid $3.5 million for the recount after alleging reports of fraud \u2013 there has been little change so far to the unofficial results reported on Election Day. Trump won the state by 22,000 votes over Clinton.\n\nIn a twist, Trump is gaining.\u00a0\n\nBy Wednesday morning, Trump had widened his victory margin over Clinton in Wisconsin by 146 votes, with 23 of the state's 72 counties having finished their recounts as of Tuesday. In those counties, Trump gained 105 votes and Clinton dropped 41 votes.\n\nStein, who received about 1 percent of the vote in the states under question, said her intent was not to help Clinton, but to verify the accuracy of the count as she believed the votes were susceptible to computer hacking.\n\n\"We're not finding any problems with the machines,\" Reid Magney, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, told FoxNews.com. \"The Stein campaign wanted a recount because they thought there was some problems with our machines and that was not the case.\"\n\nWhatever Stein's reasons, it appears the recount has been more of a help than a hindrance to Trump, who saw the number of votes for him go up in several counties.\n\nIn Green Lake County, which sits about 100 miles northwest of Milwaukee, the unofficial results from election night had Trump winning with 6,213 votes to Clinton's 2,701. The recount found that Trump actually received 6,216 votes while Clinton lost eight votes to finish with 2,693.\n\nAnd in those counties where Clinton picked up votes on Trump, Wisconsin officials said the number was not enough to influence the results.\n\n\"The overall results will not change,\" Magney said. \"It's two votes here, two votes there.\"\n\nThe remaining counties in the Badger State have until Dec. 12 to recount their votes in order for Wisconsin to certify its results by the following day, and ensure they count when the Electoral College votes on Dec. 19.\n\nMichigan\n\nA statewide hand recount of Michigan's roughly 2.8 million ballots that began on Monday is now up in the air as a federal judge\u00a0will hold a hearing Wednesday on whether to stop it.\n\nThe state elections board also is meeting Wednesday, a day after the Michigan appeals court ordered it to dismiss Stein's recount petition, claiming she has no standing. The court noted that she received 1 percent of the vote and has no chance of catching Trump, who narrowly defeated Clinton in the state. A federal judge takes up the matter next.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the certified results from late November, Trump won the state by about 10,700 votes \u2013 or about two-tenths of a percentage point. The recount so far was looking at eight counties, including the state's largest, Wayne.\n\nA controversy also is brewing in that county as officials said Tuesday that one-third of precincts could be disqualified from the recount because of problems with ballots.\n\nWayne County \u2013 home to Detroit \u2013 overwhelmingly voted for Clinton late last month, but officials couldn't reconcile vote totals for 610 of 1,680 precincts during a countywide canvass of vote results. During the canvass, the number of ballots in precinct poll books did not match those of voting machine printout reports in 59 percent of precincts, 392 of 662.\n\nMichigan state law prohibits precincts whose poll books don't match with ballots from recounting votes.\n\nDespite the issue in Wayne County, experts say it will have little effect on the results in Michigan, or nationally.\n\n\"They are not going to affect the decision, but the discrepancy certainly warrants further investigation,\" Ned Foley, a professor of election law at Ohio State University, told FoxNews.com. \"Even if it did change the results in Michigan, it still wouldn't matter because Clinton needed to win all three states to surpass Trump in the Electoral College.\"\u00a0\n\nPennsylvania\n\nVerification measures have been taken in the Keystone State's two largest counties \u2013 Philadelphia and Allegheny (home of Pittsburgh) \u2013 but the fate of a statewide recount rests in the hands of a federal court after Stein's Green Party filed a federal lawsuit on Monday.\n\nWhile Pennsylvania has yet to certify its results from November's election, an updated count by state election officials saw Trump's lead shrink to just about 46,000 over Clinton out of the 6 million votes cast in the state.\n\nSo far there have been very few reports of discrepancies in the recounts that have taken place.\n\nA re-examination of Allegheny County voting machine results did not change any votes and, in Philadelphia, Clinton gained only five votes after the City Commissioner's Office recounted votes in 75 of Philadelphia's more than 1,600 voting divisions in response to the recount appeal by more than 250 Philadelphia residents.\u00a0\n\nThese numbers are still shy of Pennsylvania's 0.5 percent trigger for an automatic statewide recount.\u00a0\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.6113743782043501, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 951, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.80495429464, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.57728706624606, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/15/latest-envoys-urge-israel-palestinians-to-back-peace.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [66]}}, "headline": "The Latest: Envoys urge Israel, Palestinians to back peace", "wordcount_as_scraped": 725, "date": "20170115210000", "story_content": "PARIS \u2013 \u00a0The Latest on a Paris conference on Mideast peace (all times local):\n\n6 p.m.\n\nMore than 70 countries have called on Israel and the Palestinians to restate their commitment to a peace settlement and to refrain from unilateral actions.\n\nThe closing statement at a Mideast peace conference in Paris on Sunday was meant to send a powerful message to Israel and the incoming Trump administration to keep hopes alive for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nTrump's campaign platform made no mention of Palestinian independence \u2014 the solution favored by the international community.\n\nThe statement urged both sides to \"officially restate their commitment to the two-state solution\" and disassociate from voices that reject this.

Many have also been looted in the wake of their destruction.\n\nMany Assyrians who fled say that what is immediately needed in their villages for them to return is greater security or some sort of assurance of protection from Baghdad.\n\n\"The damage to these villages is hard to overstate,\" Robert Nicholson \u2013 executive director of the Philos Project, an advocacy and relief organization \u2013 told FoxNews.com. \"In one last act of vengeance, ISIS made sure that returning Assyrian families would find their homes and business shot full of holes, rigged with mines and utterly demolished.\"\n\nNicholson, like many others in the international community, say that rebuilding the region will take years and that funding is badly needed.\n\n\"The road is long, but the journey is made up of single steps. We need to start small, focusing on the most important villages and work outward,\" he said. \"We need the international community to step in. All those countries in Europe and around the world that talk about preserving minority peoples, indigenous peoples, need to step up and put their money where their mouth is.\"\n\nThe ICRC is spearheading an initiative to help with rebuilding efforts in the Nineveh Plain. The group's Operation Return to Nineveh was launched last month to raise funds to rebuild homes and churches in Assyrian communities that were destroyed by ISIS.\n\n\"Restoring these villages will be a long-term project, but it has to be done,\" Juliana Taimoorazy, the organization's executive director, told FoxNews.com. \"It's doable only if there's active security on the ground.\"\n\nTaimoorazy's group has also chosen to \"adopt\" one town \u2013 Tellisqof \u2013 and is in the process of raising money and resources to rebuild the village.\n\n\"A lot of these [Assyrian] people are farmers and their land was polluted with chemicals by ISIS,\" she said. \"They are unable to work on the land.\n\n\"We have to proceed with caution, but we have to come alongside the Assyrian people to help them rebuild. They have to return home.\"\n\n\n\nPerry Chiaramonte is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

It did the wrong thing last week when it ended the emergency.\n\nI say that for several reasons, not least of which is the signal given by the latest declaration: that Zika is no longer a pressing global concern.\n\nA legal technicality. I understand why the WHO Emergency Committee terminated the emergency. It felt obliged to follow the International Health Regulations, a move likely to set a precedent for future outbreaks. Zika is now endemic, and has been for many years. The major spread of the disease in Latin America and the Caribbean was an important reason to declare an emergency. Another was that the clusters of children born with small heads and major cognitive problems (microcephaly) were extraordinary events that required urgent research. The Emergency Committee felt that once those extraordinary events were confirmed as being linked to Zika and that the Olympics, which required emergency recommendations, were over, the requirement for a public health emergency of international concern \u2014 an unusual or unexpected event of international concern \u2014 was no longer met.\n\nAs a matter of law, the WHO director-general has considerable discretion on how to interpret the international health regulations that define public health emergencies of international concern. Zika offered a perfect opportunity to use that discretion. Moreover, the WHO has never been consistent in its interpretation of these regulations, as I describe later about polio and MERS.\n\nRead more: WHO declares Zika public health emergency over, though threat remains\n\nToo early. The southern regions of the globe will soon enter the summer season, which is peak time for mosquito breeding and biting. So far, there are no indicators that Zika won't re-emerge with a vengeance. And those regions \u2014 Latin America, southern Asia, and southern Africa \u2014 tend to have poor countries that are least prepared to fight a Zika epidemic.\n\nNo vaccine. Despite hard and sustained work by research teams around the world, a vaccine against Zika is not on the horizon. Calling off the emergency without the means to prevent an epidemic doesn't make sense.\n\nHarmful signal. Despite the potentially devastating effect of a Zika infection \u2014 babies born with microcephaly \u2014 the world has devoted scant political and economic resources to this disease. Declaring that the emergency is over will be a signal to the world that it is all right to pull resources back from fighting Zika, no matter what the WHO says. Canceling the emergency lets uninformed politicians say, \"It's no longer an emergency. Let's devote the funds to other priorities.\" That's a likely scenario for the incoming Trump administration, which has shown its antipathy, if not hostility, to global and United Nations institutions.\n\nRead more: Scientists zero in on microcephaly risk for babies born to Zika-infected mothers\n\nDeciding that the outbreak of a disease is or is not a public health emergency of international concern should be squarely based on science. Yet all too often it has a political dimension as well. In May 2014, for example, WHO declared an emergency for polio, even though only a small number of cases had emerged. That emergency is still in effect. The Gates Foundation, Rotary International, and other politically powerful organizations have poured enormous resources into polio eradication. A year earlier, WHO did not call an emergency for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), even though the virus that causes MERS fulfilled all the requirements for an emergency. Saudi Arabia is the epicenter of MERS and it is widely believed the Saudi government exerted political influence to prevent an emergency declaration.\n\nAlthough understandable, it is disconcerting that the WHO terminated the Zika emergency so quickly. Zika, with its effect on mothers and babies, has an enormous political \u2014 not to mention economic, social, and moral \u2014 dimensions.\n\nCalling off the Zika emergency means dismantling the Zika Emergency Committee. That in itself is a handicap to the global response because the committee, chaired by David Heymann, has been a strong, intelligent, and powerful voice that kept Zika on the front burner.\n\nEbola taught us that the world is woefully unprepared for epidemics and that, in addition to causing death and suffering, epidemics cause enormous economic and social upheaval.\n\nDeclaring an outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern sounds the alarm to the world to be watchful and prepared to act with manpower, funding, and political support. Discontinuing the alarm too soon sends the opposite signal, and could be an excuse for political leaders to pull back on national and global preparedness and response. To his credit, Dr. Peter Salama, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program said, \"Zika is here to stay, and the WHO's response is here to stay.\" That is the right sense of urgency, but sadly the WHO has given a subtle signal that the world can go on with business as usual.\n\nLawrence O.

It was to pick up a 45-pound white Canaan dog named \"Ghost\" and reunite him with his human companion back home.\n\nIt's the kind of mission this soldier, who declined to give his name for security reasons, says he conducts in war zones around the world.\n\n\"It's the best feeling to reunite these pets with their soldiers,\" he told Fox News. \"I was wounded in Iraq, myself, and I owe my life to my dog. There is a bond there that could never be broken.\"\n\nFor American soldiers serving abroad, pets are not considered military property \u2013 and are often left to die in the war zones where they bonded with their handlers. But this special operations soldier, with the help of a New York animal rescue group, has made it his mission to fly into countries in the Middle East and bring the pets back to the U.S. to live with their companions and their families.\u00a0\n\n\"There's a risk of kidnapping \u2013 there's a risk of everything over there. You don't know who's your friend and who isn't,\" said the soldier, a 14-year special operations veteran who to date has carried out 20 missions, returning dozens of pets.\n\n\"I had a gun held to my head while I was trying to get a dog,\" he said.\n\nEach operation costs between $3,000 and $4,000, and is funded entirely by Guardians of Rescue, a group based in Smithtown, N.Y., that has been providing financial assistance for such missions since 2012 in places like\u00a0Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen.\n\n\"The animals are not classified as military property, therefore they're not authorized on the packing list,\" the soldier said. \"You take home with you what you bring.\"\n\nPast rescues include an orange, fluffy cat named, \"Majnoon\" and a dark-colored puppy found near death in a desert after his mother had been shot and killed.\n\nThe soldier explained what he called a \"very flawed policy\" in the Middle East called \"vector control,\" in which local contractors at the bases within the region trap and exterminate the animals, including packs of ferral dogs.\n\nSuch was the case for Ghost, who, along with his entire litter, was poisoned as part of the vector control program. The 1-year-old dog miraculously survived, according to the veteran, who brought him stateside in November to live with his soldier's family in the Northeast. \u00a0\n\n\"I think he realizes he's lucky,\" he said of Ghost, whom he described as the quintessential puppy who loves to play.\u00a0\n\n\"He has an undying love for his soldier,\" he said.\n\nThere are many logistical challenges involved in animal rescue missions, said Robert\u00a0Misseri, who runs Guardians of Rescue, the subject of a weekly show on \"Animal Planet.\" Pets must receive medical clearance before they can leave the country for the U.S. The goal for each mission is to bring home four animals at a time -- an operation Misseri said is funded through many small donations.\n\nEvery time a pet is reunited with its soldier, \"it helps both ends of the leash,\" he said.\n\n\"When you know you can help an animal stay alive and also prevent a service member from experiencing guilt for having left a pet behind -- it's very rewarding,\" Misseri said.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 563, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.06105164523, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.84191829484902, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/17/trump-presidency-is-giving-europeans-hissy-fits-blame-un-for-hysteria.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [4546], "\u00a0": [598, 714, 890, 1219, 1558, 1962, 2014, 2111, 2235, 2881, 3226, 3367, 3401, 3868, 4109, 4340, 4477, 4622, 4745, 4807, 5015, 5057, 5151, 5663, 5939]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 847, "scraper_regex": 901}}, "headline": "A Trump presidency is giving Europeans hissy fits.

For the explanation of why Americans demanded a fresh start can be found as much in the chambers of international diplomacy as it can in Washington corridors.\n\nThe United Nations provides a useful vantage point by which to understand the Trump phenomenon.\n\nOn September 5, 2016, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein claimed there were similarities between Donald Trump and ISIS. \u00a0He labeled Trump a \"populist\" and opined \"the propaganda of Da'esh uses tactics similar to those of the populists.\"\u00a0 On October 12, 2016 al-Hussein directly weighed into the U.S. elections and told reporters, if elected, Donald Trump \"would be dangerous from an international point of view.\"\u00a0 Evidently, it never occurred to a Jordanian prince that most American listeners would wonder first about his qualifications to lecture them on freedom of speech, democracy and human rights.\n\nIf Americans had been looking for human rights guidance from the United Nations, however, they would have encountered other impediments.\u00a0 \n\nIn late October, the UN General Assembly elected Saudi Arabia to the UN's top human rights body, the Human Rights Council. Iran is an elected member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. Sudan supervises NGO applications for UN-accreditation and participatory rights from its berth as Vice-Chair of the UN's Committee on NGO's. \u00a0Is a disconnect between multilateral authority figures and the chosen standard-bearer of American values really so difficult to figure out?\n\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon also made a steady stream of veiled swipes at the Republican candidate and his party's platform over the course of the campaign. Speaking about climate change on May 18, 2016 at a US campus commencement address, he ordered students:\u00a0 \"Don't vote for politicians who deny the problem.\"\u00a0 On September 20, 2016 he told the General Assembly: \"I say to political leaders and candidates:\u00a0 do not engage in the cynical and dangerous political math that says you add votes by dividing people and multiplying fear.\u00a0 The world must stand up against lies and distortions of truth\u2026\"\n\nBut Americans know the facts intrude. UN peacekeepers who arrived in Haiti in 2010 gave the population cholera, killed ten thousand people and sickened hundreds of thousands more. Ban's response has been to deny the problem: circle the wagons, claim diplomatic immunity, and deny scientifically-proven culpability and reparations. Moreover, throughout the Secretary-General's tenure he has propagated the cynical fiction of zero tolerance of sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers, while presiding over a culture of impunity for repeated violations of the world's most vulnerable women.\u00a0\n\nAnd then there is Ban Ki-moon's failure to stand up against dangerous distortions about terrorism. The UN has never been able to define terrorism because the 56 member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation insist on a distinction between terrorism and armed struggle against \"foreign occupation and colonial or alien domination.\" \u00a0\n\nSo Ban published a \"plan of action\" in December 2015 that changed the jargon to \"countering violent extremism\" and played to his audience.\u00a0 His prevention strategy begins: \u00a0\"Definitions of \"terrorism\" and \"violent extremism\" are the prerogative of Member States\u2026 [T]his Plan of Action pursues a practical approach to preventing violent extremism, without venturing to address questions of definition.\"\n\nThe world's leading multilateral institution, headquartered just minutes away from 9/11's Ground Zero, still cannot define terrorism, and instead is flogging a plan to solve a scourge it cannot identify because of political correctness.\u00a0 It ought not to have been a surprise that Americans turned elsewhere for leadership counseling.\n\nThere are other ways to make sense of the American election without succumbing to the hyperbole being flung around the globe about xenophobia.\u00a0 \n\nSerious evaluations of such accusations require a major dose of Realpolitik. Take, for instance, the wild unsubstantiated claims about Trump and his team's antisemitism being made by the Washington-based Anti-Defamation League.\u00a0 The head of the ADL served for over three years, until the end of 2014, in Obama's White House as a Special Assistant to the President.\u00a0 He's a partisan, period.\n\nFrench Ambassador to the United States, G\u00e9rard Araud, tweeted immediately following the election on November 9, 2016:\u00a0 \"The world is collapsing before our eyes.\" That is precisely the kind of unhinged nonsense that Americans just tuned out.\u00a0\n\nAfter eight years of President Obama, where is \"the world\"?\u00a0 Sanctions against Iran \u2013 the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism \u2013 are in ruins and, despite militarization, the country has been granted a right to enrich uranium. Nuclear proliferation is underway.\u00a0 Four-hundred thousand are dead in Syria.\u00a0 Refugee flows are fueling serious instability. Islamist radicalization is on the ascendance.\u00a0 Russia and China are territorially on the march. North Korea is becoming increasingly belligerent. Turkish democratization has been set back decades. Hilary Clinton was Obama's Secretary of State through half of all this, and in effect, was an Obama third term. To ordinary Americans, not international elites, this looked like a world collapsing already.\n\nWatching Europeans and the United Nations wish for more of the same, Americans might begin to suspect that the world wants an American president to fail.\u00a0 If not, now would be a good time to work with President Trump to succeed, for when America wins so does international peace and security, democracy and human rights.\n\n\n\nAnne Bayefsky is director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust.

I mean, they know what they do, and that is we help so many veterans who come home and have a struggle with getting their benefits and DAV makes sure that that's achieved\u2026We help [veterans] not just with recovery from their wounds, if that's the case, PTSD if that's the case, [we] help with families and the struggle that they might have with payments for cars and homes and things like that. People can sign onto this website called DAV.org/JoinLee and for Veterans Day to November 29th you can actually get on the website, make a video of the soldier in your family or some that you admire. You can actually go to the wall of honor and write a message.\n\nFOX411 Country: Tell me about the special show that you have on Veterans Day this year?\nGreenwood: Oh that's fabulous, I'm doing Fox & Friends of course Veterans Day in the morning and then I'm flying to San Antonio and I have a performance with a friend of mine, who's been my friend, he was wounded in Afghanistan, lost both legs, Justin Lane\u2026 \u00a0it's a special show to honor him and all that he has done for America.\"\n\nFOX411 Country: You've performed on more than 30 USO tours. Why has it been so important to you to be involved and how do those shows stand out for you?\nGreenwood: I have to be really honest with you, when I was 14, 15-years-old in California where I was raised, it basically was some income. The USO would pay us to go play\u2026But while I was there, I recognize the military, I loved the discipline, I didn't serve in the military, my father was in World War II right after the bombing of Pearl Harbor he joined the Navy but it wasn't my calling. I was 3A in the draft and now we have an all-volunteer army. So people who sign up for this I recognize that there's such a tremendous sacrifice. Not just the duty and away from home a lot, because we're away from home a lot with our country music tours we're gone sometimes 200-300 days a year but they're gone for two or three years at a time. And may not see a child that was just born or something so it's really, I recognize the sacrifice, so I just do all I possibly can to honor our veterans and this new assignment as ambassador for the DAV I can't tell you how proud I am to do this.\n\nFOX411 Country: What message do you hope people take away from \"God Bless the U.S.A.?\"\nGreenwood: Well, if you remember how I wrote the song, the first line is \"If tomorrow all the things were gone I'd worked for all my life.\" I was raised on a farm in Sacramento, California. I saw that farm disappear from my grandparents. We were sharecroppers and there was grain subsidizing to Russia at the time. This was like in the late 1950s and they were paid not to farm. We couldn't make a living. And so that was the first line of the song. When I get to the middle of the song I say \"I'm proud to be an American.\" I had not heard anybody say that since my father served in World War II. And I wrote that song in 1983 it was a time of peace. But I said, you know, we really need to do this and \u2013 there will be another song in 20 years from now, or 30 years from now, that somebody will honor America for but right now it's America's most recognized patriotic anthem and I'm going to sing it everywhere I can.\n\n\n\nFox News Entertainment Producer Ashley Dvorkin covers celebrity news, red carpets, TV, music, and movies.

Syria sent a military delegation, headed by the country's U.N. ambassador.\n\nThe U.N. envoy is mediating.\n\nFor the first time in internationally sponsored talks, Syrian armed groups \u2014 not political \u2014 are leading the opposition. Thirteen rebel factions, including from the western-backed Free Syrian Army, sent delegates.\n\nThese groups are the original signatories of the Russia, Turkey-sponsored Dec. 30 cease-fire, approved by Iran and the Syrian government. Most have suffered major battlefield losses. Others have been forced to merge with larger groups.\n\nWHO IS NOT?\n\nAl-Qaida-linked Fatah al-Sham Front is excluded from the cease-fire and has criticized the talks as a \"conspiracy\" aimed at driving a wedge among rebel groups and putting out the rebellion's fire.\n\nNotably absent are the ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham and Nour el-Din el-Zinki groups, among the most powerful fighters on the ground in Syria who have also worked closely with Fatah al-Sham.\n\nAlso absent is the main U.S.-backed Kurdish rebel group. The group, a lead U.S. partner on the ground in the fight against the Islamist State group, has been a source of tension between Washington and Turkey, which sees it as an extension of its own Kurdish rebel group it labels as terrorists.\n\nSaudi Arabia, a major backer of the opposition, has no representatives to the talks. Its participation was a sticky issue with Iran.\n\nWHAT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME\n\nThe U.S. has played no role in arranging these talks. They come days after Trump took office \u2014 signaling that Putin aims to \"start the post-Obama chapter in Syria on his terms, confronting the new American administration with the fait accompli of regime victory in Aleppo,\" said Fabrice Balanche, of the Washington Institute.\n\nThe rebels lost the northern Syrian city last month in a Russian-backed government offensive. Rebels are also losing backing, as generous supporters such as Gulf countries and Turkey are going through their own economic crises. Trump has signaled that he will stop support for the rebels, saying they \"could be worse\" than Assad.\n\nThe talks come at a time when Turkey's policy in Syria is changing. Turkey has sent troops into Syria to fight the Islamic State group, who turned their terror against the Turkish state, and thwart Kurdish aspirations for autonomous rule along Syria's border with Turkey. After years of supporting the opposition's call for Assad to step down, Ankara has signaled it accepts a role for him in the transition. Ankara is also pivoting toward Moscow as its relations with the U.S. become strained over Washington's support of Kurdish rebel fighters.\n\nWHAT IS ON THE AGENDA?\n\nRussia says the talks will help pave the way for U.N. talks expected in Geneva next month by ensuring field commanders participate in the peace process.\n\nRebels say they are in Astana only to ensure a cease-fire is extended to all of Syria, while Washington is contemplating its new Syria policy.\n\nFor Assad, the talks are another capitulation by the non-Jihadi rebel groups, who are reeling from battlefield losses. Before the talks, he said the conference offers armed groups a chance to join reconciliation initiatives through which the government has negotiated local surrender deals.\n\nJoshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said Assad is unlikely to depart from this policy at Astana.\n\n\"By now, it has become clear that Assad cannot offer major political reform without jeopardizing his regime security,\" he said.\n\nIS THIS THE BEGINNING OF THE END?\n\nPossibly. The talks represent the best chance yet for a resolution of the conflict, simply because the three most influential sides \u2014 Russia, Turkey and Iran \u2014 are working together to find the contours of a settlement.\n\nIf they make it past the first round of talks, it would represent a first step in a long journey toward a political solution.\n\nHowever, there are enormous challenges, including convincing rebels to distance themselves from the jihadist al-Qaida-linked groups, and accepting a political agreement that preserves the main pillars of the Assad regime.\n\nWHAT NEXT?\n\nThe Astana talks will cement the Kremlin's role as the primary architect of a political solution, but a short-term breakthrough remains uncertain, said Ayham Kamel, director of the Middle East and North Africa at the Eurasia Group.\n\nIn principle, Putin's effort is also set to eliminate any negotiating structure that would require Assad's removal. But Moscow will press hard for a power-sharing arrangement that includes non-Islamist opposition figures.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 12, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.80984354019165, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 816, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.22311623612, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123120000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.41176470588235, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/23/texas-hospital-gives-firebombed-syrian-children-second-chance-at-life.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [424, 889, 1130, 1298, 2587, 3034, 3840, 4642, 4728]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 720, "scraper_regex": 789}}, "headline": "Texas hospital gives firebombed Syrian children a second chance at life", "wordcount_as_scraped": 789, "date": "20170123210000", "story_content": "In the summer of 2014, 4-year-old Safia was playing in her family home in the Syrian city of Deir Ezzor when a bomb blast scalded 70 percent of her face and body. An explosive device in the Syrian city of Deir Al Zour left Israa, 8, severely burned. And a jet missile in Daraa that killed the family of 10-year-old Yumna also left her with melted flesh.\u00a0\n\nThey are considered the lucky ones.\n\nThey are among 11 Syrian children who for the past three years have been brought to the famed burn center at Shriners Hospital for Children (SHC) in Galveston, Texas, for a second chance at life. The injured kids were flown to the hospital under a program established by the non-profit Burnt Children Relief Foundation (BCRF), which raises money to transport the children while the hospital's team assists with medical costs.\u00a0\n\n\"The humanitarian crisis is the worst since World War II,\" Syrian Institute for Progress (SIP) Chairwoman Susan Baaj, who coordinates the foundation's efforts to assist the children, told Fox News. \"These kids are in dire need for help.\" \u00a0\n\nThe most recent case, 7-year-old Moath \u2013 whose face was deeply seared by flames in Aleppo \u2013 arrived with his mother last Thursday to begin his long road to recovery.\u00a0\n\n\"SHC has a global focus. Many times, the specialized care children need is not available in Syria, so we provide the care,\" said John McCabe, executive vice president of Shriner's Hospital.\n\nSLIDESHOW: BURNED SYRIAN CHILDREN FIND TREATMENT IN TEXAS\n\n\"We believe every child deserves the best chance in life.\"\n\nSIP President Saed Moujtahed, who is the foundation's founder, said one of its biggest challenges is navigating the necessary paperwork for the children to enter the U.S. Most of the young and wounded do not have any identification papers, their homes often blown to bits in the bombing.\n\n\"We face challenges with determining guardianship and obtaining travel visas,\" McCabe said, \"as we cannot transport them to one of our hospitals without these.\"\n\nThrough cooperation between the U.S Consulate in Istanbul and the Turkish consulates in Los Angeles and Houston, travel documents are processed for the child in need and one (female) immediate family member.\n\nAlmost every day, the foundation receives desperate request for help from families abroad with young children severely singed by conflict. But, because of financial constraints, the all-volunteer foundation can only help the most severe cases. Scores of other children are still waiting to cut through visa red tape.\u00a0\n\nBut, Moujtahed noted, unlike other controversial refugee programs, the foundation's policy is not to grant permanent residency to the children. Rather, the children in desperate need undergo surgeries and follow-up treatment \u2013 which could last between six months to two years, on average \u2013 before returning to the Middle East. So far, three of the cases have successfully returned to countries neighboring Syria and the others soon will follow.\u00a0\n\nOklahoma Republican Congressman Steve Russell, a retired soldier, said he is proud of the work the hospital and the foundation is doing. The effort has bipartisan support and the backing of the U.S. State Department.\n\n\"I visited Syrian refugee camps (in Turkey) during the big debate about refugees. I wanted to see what the vetting process was and see it firsthand,\" Russell told Fox News, referring to last year's deep divides over the resettlement of Syrians amid terrorism concerns. \"During the course of that we became aware of a family, a mother who had lost several children but her youngest daughter, Kawthar, was horribly burned and disfigured.\"\n\nKawthar, 2, from Idlib, has since undergone successful treatment at Shriner's and returned to build a new life with her displaced family in Turkey.\u00a0\n\nALEPPO'S LANDMARK MOSQUE BEARS SCARS OF SYRIA'S WAR\n\nThe foundation also tries to integrate the children into the \"American way of life\" through education, English-language classes and other activities \u2013 even though their stay in the country is not permanent. And while the foundation was specifically established to treat Syrian minors, it hopes to eventually expand its mission to children across the world who have been caught in the cross fire of conflict.\n\n\"The biggest reward is looking at the change in the child \u2013 not only physically, but psychologically,\" Moujtahed said, recalling the way in which Kawthar spotted another child around her own age in recovery dancing, and for the first time danced, too. \"You can see the smile and you can sense the security of the faces of these children.\u00a0There is great peace that comes with that.\"\n\nJamie Brennan contributed to this report\u00a0\n\n\n\nHollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

Once assembled, the steel-and-wire frame should stand 98 meters (320 feet) high \u2014 more than 40 meters (131 feet) taller than the current record-holder.\n\nOrganizers said they wanted the tree to help promote ethnic and religious harmony in the Buddhist-majority South Asian island nation.\n\n\"This is just to show the world that we can live as one country, one nation,\" said the former cricket player Arjuna Ranatunga, now Sri Lanka's minister of ports and shipping. Sri Lanka has \"issues regarding religion, caste and race,\" he said.\n\nIn recent years, Sri Lanka's reputation as an inclusive multicultural country has suffered amid complaints by minority Christian and Muslim communities of state-sponsored discrimination, as well as allegations of widespread abuses against minority ethnic Tamils both during and after the country's civil war against Tamil rebels, which ended in 2009.\n\nSince taking power in January 2015, President Maithripala Sirisena and his government have ushered in an era of transparency and postwar reconciliation, but have yet to make good on many of their promises, including discovering the fate of thousands of people who disappeared during the war or investigating alleged wartime abuses by the military.\n\n\"The new government has taken steps to control most of the things,\" Ranatunga said, describing the Christmas tree as \"one small gesture that we can show the world that we can live in harmony.\"\n\nSome non-Christian residents of Colombo \u2014 where Christmas lights and Santa Claus imagery overtake shopping malls during the holiday season \u2014 were delighted by the enormity of the tree challenge.\n\n\"It's like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see such a thing being erected with your own eyes,\" store clerk Charith Nissanka, 38, said as he walked by the construction site, strewn with steel pipes and thousands of meters (yards) of netting, onto which the ornaments will be attached. Eventually, there will be more than 1 million natural pine cones attached to the tree, topped by a 6-meter-high (20-foot-high) shining star.\n\nUltimately, Sri Lanka hopes the Christmas tree will be declared the world's tallest artificial one, and efforts are being made to gather evidence to send to Guinness World Records, said the project's chief organizer, Mangala Gunasekara.\n\nCurrently, the record is held by a Chinese firm that put up a 55-meter-high (180-foot-high) tree-like tower of lights and synthetic foliage, ornaments and lamps in the city of Guangzhou last year.\n\nThe world's tallest real Christmas tree ever is listed as a 67-meter-high (221-foot-high) Douglas fir erected in 1950 at Northgate Shopping Center in Seattle. By comparison, this year's Christmas tree in New York City's Rockefeller Center is a Norway spruce that stands about 29 meters (94 feet) tall and is about 90 years old.\n\nNot everyone in Sri Lanka thought the tree was a good idea, though.\n\nFour months after construction began in August, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith \u2014 representing the island nation's 1.5 million Catholics \u2014 lambasted the $80,000 project as a waste of money. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe responded to the criticism by saying the tree was not being built with public money, but with donations from individuals and private firms.\n\nBut workers missed initial deadlines set for Dec. 15, and then another on Tuesday. Organizers now say they're planning to have the tree up by Christmas Eve on Saturday night. The tree would then stay up until Jan. 6.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 578, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.0489868490200003, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161220090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.4221453287197203, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/12/sore-loser-obama-turns-to-russian-hacking-to-delegitimize-trumps-triumph.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1702, 2530, 5567, 5569, 5765]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 811, "scraper_regex": 911}}, "headline": "Sore loser Obama turns to Russian hacking to delegitimize Trump's triumph", "wordcount_as_scraped": 911, "date": "20161212150000", "story_content": "Make no mistake: it's payback time. In ordering up a \"deep dive\" into possible Russian interference in the election of Donald Trump, sore loser Barack Obama wants to delegitimize the real estate magnate's win. His motive? Punishing Trump for the years the mogul spent publicly questioning whether Obama was an American citizen, which cast doubts on the legitimacy of his presidency. Ah, how sweet the revenge. And how pitiful.\n\nPresident Obama has searched high and, increasingly, low, for the reasons he and Hillary Clinton lost the election. He has blamed Fox News, insufficient grass-roots campaigning by Hillary, \"fake news\", and now has singled out Russian meddling for the loss of 194 of 207 counties that voted for him in either 2008 or 2012.\n\nThe suggestion is that Vladimir Putin wanted Trump to win; the liberal media has hinted darkly that the president-elect and his campaign team have \"ties\" to the Russian head of state.\n\nAs most Americans review Trump's defense and security picks, the notion that the new administration will go easy on our adversaries \u2013 including Russia \u2013 is laughable. Retired General James Mattis, whom Trump has nominated to head Defense, has described Russia's annexation of Crimea as a \"severe\" threat, one underestimated by the Obama White House. Mattis is not to be trifled with.\n\nThe media has ignored the reality that Moscow's possible hacking of DNC and Podesta's emails were retaliation for Hillary Clinton's assertions that Russian elections in 2011 were \"rigged\" \u2013 an accusation that infuriated Putin. When protests erupted in Russia over the election outcome, Putin blamed Clinton. \u00a0\"She said they were dishonest and unfair,\" Putin said at the time. He accused then Secretary of State Clinton for giving \"a signal\" to demonstrators organized \"with the support of the U.S. State Department\u2026We need to safeguard ourselves from this interference in our internal affairs,\" Putin said. Does this sound familiar? Turnabout is fair play, and Putin has made it clear that if we mess with his elections, he will mess with ours.\n\nObama knows this. Politico reported in a July piece entitled \"Why Putin Hates Hillary\" that the Russian leader's anger about Clinton's interference was \"communicated directly to President Barack Obama.\" Former administration officials involved with Russian policy say the Kremlin saw Clinton as taking a harder line against Russia \u2013 \"reset\" notwithstanding \u2013 than others in the White House.\u00a0 \"And they say Putin sees Clinton as a forceful proponent of \"regime change\" policies that the Russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival.\"\n\nThat is why the Russians may have tried to undermine Hillary Clinton, not because they see Trump as an ally. Like most of the world, Moscow no doubt expected Clinton to win. Coming into office weakened by Putin's meddling would have undoubtedly pleased Moscow no end.\n\nObama's call for an investigation is transparently bogus. First, the CIA offers up only scant circumstantial evidence \u2013 evidence that even the New York Times admits \"does not support firm judgements\" -- to make the charge that Russia worked to favor Trump. The FBI isn't even on board with the conclusion.\n\nSecond, everyone knows that no serious inquiry could possibly be completed by January 20, when Trump will be sworn in. The federal government operates with glacial pacing; Obama knows the report will likely never be completed, and so the issue of Russian hacking will hang like a cloud \u2013 like the \"birther\" rumors \u2013 over the Trump White House.\n\nWhile muttering about how the need for \"transparency\" might inspire the investigation into the hacking, the Times et al ignore the reality: the emails released via WikiLeaks that outed cheating by the DNC in favor of Hillary Clinton, or showed how disrespectful her camp was of Catholics and average Americans, actually increased the transparency of the election. The United States should not tolerate cyberattacks from a foreign government; nor should we tolerate cheating in our politics.\n\nObama is still smarting from having put himself on the line during the campaign, telling the Black Congressional Caucus, for instance, \"I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election.\"\n\nHe made Hillary's campaign all about him, but she lost anyway. That has to sting. Especially since Americans, in choosing Trump, also chose to undo most of Obama's most precious accomplishments.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump made no secret of his desire to toss Obama's climate agenda, his Iran deal and, most importantly, ObamaCare. In recent weeks, he has nominated cabinet officials who are well suited to carrying out those promises. Lofting Scott Pruit, the Oklahoma Attorney General, to the EPA: good-bye overreaching anti-fossil fuel regulations. Rep. Tom Price for HHS: so long ObamaCare. \"Mad Dog\" Mattis for Defense: the Iran deal is toast. For a president who has put such stock in his \"legacy\", and who took office being compared to Abraham Lincoln, the erasure of his eight years must be intolerable.\n\nWhat will be left of the Obama presidency, which chose to act unilaterally through executive actions and regulations rather than work through Congress? Not much.\n\nActually, with his embarrassing reluctance to shoulder any responsibility for the drubbing given Democrats over the past eight years, his legacy will begin with a very sour taste in the country's mouth.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\nLiz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

You'll need two blood tests showing low levels\u2014usually around 300 nanograms per declileter (ng/dL) or lower, depending on the lab\u2014before your doctor makes an official low testosterone diagnosis, Dr. Anawalt says.\n\nThe good news is, if low T is truly to blame, many of the health side effects of low testosterone can be reversed, or at least improved, with\u00a0testosterone therapy.\u00a0\n\n1. LOW TESTOSTERONE SYMPTOM: YOUR SEX DRIVE DISAPPEARS.\n\nPerhaps the best-known, quickest, and most common effect of low T is\u00a0low libido, says urologist Philip Werthman, M.D., director of the Center for Male Reproductive Medicine and Vasectomy Reversal in Los Angeles.\n\nIn fact, nearly every patient who comes to his office with known or suspected low T complains of a lack of sexual appetite. Besides wanting less sex, men with low T may also\u00a0masturbate\u00a0less and report fewer fantasies and erotic dreams.\n\nBrain areas involved with sexual desire, including the amygdala, are packed with testosterone receptors, says S. Adam Ramin, M.D., urologic surgeon and medical director of Urology Cancer Specialists in Los Angeles.\u00a0\n\nThe hormone fits inside them like a lock inside a key, lighting them up to arouse you. Without it, you're missing a critical step in the turn-on process.\n\nThis lack of desire to have sex can cause problems with\u00a0erections, though low T doesn't directly affect the plumbing involved in getting or staying hard, Dr. Ramin says.\n\nRelated:\u00a0The\u00a0Men's Health\u00a0Guide To Erectile Dysfunction: What Causes It, How to Fix It, and How to Avoid It\n\n2. LOW TESTOSTERONE SYMPTOM: YOUR MUSCLES SHRINK.\n\nAmple testosterone puts your body in an anabolic, or muscle-building, state by helping your body produce and assemble proteins that form the building blocks of lean mass.\n\nWhen your testosterone levels drop, your body turns catabolic instead, breaking down\u00a0muscle\u00a0tissue instead of building it up, Dr. Werthman says.\u00a0\n\nAt first, you might notice that it's tougher to push as much weight at the gym or build\u00a0muscle, he notes.\u00a0\n\nRelated:\u00a0What's the Most Muscle You Can Gain?\n\nAnd after a few weeks of low T, you can expect to lose\u00a0muscle\u00a0mass, Dr. Anawalt says.\n\nIn fact, in one Japanese\u00a0study, men with low free testosterone levels\u2014a measure of the amount of hormone available to bind to receptors\u2014had double to triple the risk of\u00a0muscle\u00a0loss with aging as those with normal levels.\n\n3. LOW TESTOSTERONE SYMPTOM: YOUR PENIS MAY GET SMALLER, TOO.\n\nWithout a steady flow of testosterone, the tissues in your penis, scrotum, and testicles can atrophy, or shrivel, says Dr. Ramin.\n\nAs a result, your penis might lose length and girth. You may notice your balls shrink, too\u2014they often shrivel to half the size and turn squishy instead of firm, he says.\u00a0\n\nThough testosterone replacement therapy won't bring back your testicular volume, when it comes to your penis, the treatment \"has a good chance of restoring its glory,\" Dr. Ramin says. (In fact, testosterone therapy in boys with a micropenis can increase their size by up to an inch and a half, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0in the\u00a0Indian Journal of Urology.)\n\n4. LOW TESTOSTERONE SYMPTOM: YOUR BELLY GROWS.\n\nEven as you lose size where it counts, you gain it where it hurts, Dr. Anawalt says.\u00a0\n\nIn one Australian\u00a0study, men with prostate cancer gained 14 percent more body fat and 22 percent more visceral fat after one year of androgen deprivation therapy, a treatment which turns off testosterone's effects.\n\nVisceral fat is the deep abdominal fat that forms around your organs and increases your risk for\u00a0diabetes\u00a0and\u00a0heart disease.\n\nRelated:\u00a0METASHRED EXTREME\u2014the Ultimate Fitness Program From\u00a0Men's Health\u00a0Designed to Shred Body Fat and Max Out Muscle Growth At the Same Time\n\nIn men, low testosterone may increase the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, the study authors suspect. This compound drives circulating building blocks called lipids into visceral fat cells, plumping them up.\n\n5. LOW TESTOSTERONE SYMPTOM: YOUR MEMORY FALTERS.\n\nTrouble with thinking and\u00a0memory\u00a0often occurs in men with low T, Dr. Werthman says.\u00a0\n\nIn 2015\u00a0study\u00a0from Australia, men whose testosterone levels declined over 5 years also experienced a drop in scores on tests of their mental function and memory.\n\nBesides the amygdala, areas of the brain important for memory and attention\u2014such as the cerebrum\u2014also have testosterone receptors.\u00a0\n\nWhen there's not enough of the hormone pumping in to those receptors, your brain cells may not be able to function as well, the study authors note.\n\n6. LOW TESTOSTERONE SYMPTOM: YOUR MOOD TANKS.\n\nSome of the side effects of low testosterone\u2014such as\u00a0sexual dysfunction\u00a0and weight gain\u2014can bring on the blues. But there's also evidence of a more direct effect of low testosterone on mood.\u00a0\n\nAccording to\u00a0research\u00a0in the\u00a0Endocrine Journal, 23 percent of young men with newly diagnosed low testosterone met the criteria for depression, compared to only 5 percent of young guys with normal levels of the hormone.\n\nEmpty testosterone receptors in brain areas linked to mood are likely responsible for your depressed state, Dr. Ramin says.\u00a0\n\nWhat's more, mood disorders like depression or anxiety can kick off a vicious cycle, he notes\u2014depression can suppress your testicles' ability to produce testosterone, worsening the problem.\n\n7. LOW TESTOSTERONE SYMPTOM: YOUR BONES WEAKEN.\n\nBone is actually living tissue, constantly broken down and rebuilt, Dr. Ramin says.\n\nWhen testosterone levels fall, your bone breaks down faster than your body can build it back up.\u00a0\n\nAs a result, you're at a higher risk of low bone density, osteoporosis, and fractures, Dr. Anawalt says.\u00a0\n\n8. LOW TESTOSTERONE SYMPTOM: YOUR HEART MIGHT BE AT RISK.\n\nThe effect of testosterone levels on the risk of heart problems has stoked controversy among experts, Dr. Anawalt says.\u00a0\n\nOn one side, low levels of testosterone may be linked to heart problems. In fact, one\u00a0study\u00a0from the U.K. found men with low T had a greater risk of dying from heart disease than men with normal levels.\u00a0\n\nThis may be because testosterone can help open up blood vessels to the heart, allowing blood to flow more freely.\u00a0\n\nBut on the flip side, some studies have suggested that testosterone therapy\u2014especially in older men or those with existing heart conditions\u2014might increase the risk of\u00a0heart attack\u00a0or\u00a0stroke. Experts think it may thicken the blood, making a clot more likely.\u00a0\n\nRelated:\u00a030 Easy Ways to Save Your Heart Today\n\nIt seems that the extra testosterone might be raising levels\u00a0too\u00a0high, Dr. Anawalt says.\u00a0\n\nSo if you're a candidate for testosterone therapy, make sure you talk to your doctor about the benefits and the risks, Dr. Werthman says.\u00a0\n\nYour doctor may test your testosterone levels after you first start therapy or change dosages\u2014or sometimes between shots, if you're receiving treatment by injection\u2014to make sure your levels aren't surging too high, Dr. Anawalt says.\u00a0\n\nThis article originally appeared on MensHealth.com.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.11392402648926, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1058, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 0.881396337712, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 7, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.661625708884688, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.636363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/08/death-sentence-upheld-for-cleveland-man-who-killed-11-women-hid-remains-in-home.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [931]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 532, "scraper_regex": 564}}, "headline": "Death sentence upheld for Cleveland man who killed 11 women, hid remains in home", "wordcount_as_scraped": 564, "date": "20161208200000", "story_content": "Ohio's Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the conviction and death sentence of Anthony Sowell, who killed 11 women and buried or deposited them on his Cleveland property.\n\nMANHUNT OVER: SUSPECT ACCUSED OF KILLING GA. OFFICER AND WOUNDING ANOTHER IS FOUND DEAD, POLICE SAY\n\nThe 5-2 decision dismissed claims from his attorneys that he deserved a new court hearing over the admissibility of his videotaped police interrogation. That evidence was played in his capital trial.\n\n\"Although Sowell's statements to police are incriminating, the state presented overwhelming independent evidence of guilt supporting Sowell's convictions and sentence,\" the court said.\n\nESCAPED INMATE MAY HAVE SHOT OFFICER AT WALMART, POLICE SAY\n\nSowell's crimes were uncovered in 2009 when police obtained a search warrant after a report of a woman being raped in his residence.\u00a0Police found the victims' mostly nude bodies throughout his home after a woman escaped. He was sentenced in 2011.\n\nHis appellate attorneys can now ask the federal courts and eventually the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. No execution date has been set.\n\nAt issue was a 2010 hearing during which a Cleveland judge closed the courtroom while he heard arguments for and against allowing the videotaped interrogation, which lasted for more than 11 hours.\n\nThe judge ultimately allowed its use, and most of it was played during Sowell's trial.\n\nThe judge identified an overriding interest that supported closing that hearing, Justice Terrence O'Donnell said. As a result, \"the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the limited closure of the courtroom,\" O'Donnell decided.\n\nJustice William O'Neill and Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor dissented, saying a new hearing should be held. In \"a criminal-justice system governed by the rule of law, a serial murderer's trial is subject to the same constitutional protections as the trial of a low-level thief,\" O'Neill wrote.\n\nProsecutors said Sowell's victims were recovering or current drug addicts and most died of strangulation. Some had been decapitated, and the bodies of others were so badly decomposed that coroners couldn't say with certainty how they died.\n\nIn interviews with police, Sowell said he targeted women who reminded him of his ex-girlfriend, who had been addicted to crack and left him shortly before the killings began.\n\nDespite Thusday's ruling, an execution is not expected for years. Sowell could still appeal through the federal courts.\n\nKillers like Sowell are the reason Ohio has a death penalty, said Christopher Schroeder, head of Cuyahoga County's capital punishment division. \"Nothing less than the death penalty would ever be an appropriate sentence in this case,\" Schroeder said.\n\nWhile Ohio plans three executions next year, it hasn't said if it has enough drugs for additional executions. Two dozen men are on the state's death row.\n\nNew lawyers for Sowell, who spent seven years as a U.S. Marine, argued a better strategy would have been to concede Sowell's overwhelming guilt and push for life without parole based on his background, including a chaotic childhood.\n\nSowell's trial attorneys \"repeatedly directed the jurors' attention to gruesome and painfully damning evidence,\" according to a 2012 court filing by attorneys Jeffrey Gamso and Erika Cunliffe.\n\nAs a result, the trial attorneys looked desperate and jurors were likely irritated that it dragged out the trial, the filing said.\n\nGamso said Thursday that Sowell's lawyers were disappointed and would continue to pursue the case.\n\nFox News' Bill Mears and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.9526228904724094, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 532, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.5534552264200001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.81954887218045, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/29/ohio-state-attack-echoes-islamic-state-group-brutal-calls.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [70]}}, "headline": "Ohio State attack echoes Islamic State group's brutal calls", "wordcount_as_scraped": 656, "date": "20161129200000", "story_content": "NEW YORK \u2013 \u00a0In chillingly detailed articles in a slick online magazine, Islamic State extremists exhorted English-language readers this fall to carry out attacks with knives and vehicles.\n\nUsing those very methods, Somali-born student Abdul Razak Ali Artan injured 11 people Monday at Ohio State University, authorities say.\n\nIt isn't clear whether Artan ever saw or heard about the magazine's instructions, but in a Facebook post made before the attack, he said that if the U.S. wanted Muslims to stop carrying out \"lone wolf attacks,\" it should make peace with the Islamic State group. The posts were recounted by a law enforcement official who was briefed on the investigation but wasn't authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe group has for a few years urged sympathizers to strike out alone with any weapons available. But it has reinvigorated that message in recent weeks in its new propaganda magazine and a video, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. monitoring service that tracks militant postings.\n\n\"In recent months, ISIS media has shown a shift in focus toward attack instructions, offering detailed guides for performing knife attacks, vehicular attacks and other acts,\" said SITE Intelligence's executive director, Rita Katz. Monday's attack in Ohio \"consists of the recent instructions from ISIS on what tools should be used for lone-wolf attacks in the West.\"\n\nWith professional-looking design and graphics and editions in multiple languages, the new magazine, Rumiyah, emerged in September with a call to kill \"non-believers\" in Australia, including at the Sydney Opera House, according to SITE Intelligence. It keeps copies of the magazine for monitoring.\n\nDays later, an 18-year-old man told security guards at the opera house that he was under the Islamic State group's instructions to carry out an attack, police said. The teenager, who was carrying canisters of automotive fluid, was charged with threatening to destroy property.\n\nA few days after that, a 22-year-old was charged with committing a terrorist act after authorities said he stabbed and critically wounded a man walking through a Sydney park in an attack inspired by IS. In both cases, the young men had shown signs of mental problems, according to their lawyers or police.\n\nSubsequent issues of Rumiyah include articles devoted to terrorist tactics. October's was a primer on the features of various knives and where on the body to aim them to kill.\n\nNovember's topic was using vehicles as tools of terror, with an approving nod to the truck attack that killed more than 80 people in a holiday crowd in Nice, France, in July. The article expounded on the features an attack truck should have and suggested crowded streets and outdoor gatherings as targets, calling the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade an \"excellent\" choice. New York police stepped up security in response to the article and the Nice attack, partly by stationing sand-filled dump trucks near the route as barriers.\n\nMore instructions on knife attacks came this weekend in a brutal Islamic State video, which also discussed building bombs, according to SITE Intelligence.\n\nThe concept of a terrorist magazine isn't new. One of the Boston Marathon bombers and other terror suspects were found to have copies of al-Qaida's online publication Inspire, known for an article called \"Make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom,\" authorities said.\n\nIslamic State itself has put out a magazine before, but Rumiyah is \"shorter, more straightforward,\" with less focus on theological discussions, said Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, the research director of George Washington University's Program on Extremism.\n\nWhile IS publications can be a factor in guiding terror, Meleagrou-Hitchens cautions against looking to them as a cause of attacks.\n\n\"It's usually not as simple as someone just reading the propaganda and acting,\" he said. \"The question is: What makes people seek these things out in the first place? And that's a more complicated question to answer.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Tami Abdollah in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.65444278717041, "HarmVice": 23, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 636, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.62576987574, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 23, "mft_sum": 43, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161129200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.761006289308179, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/10/hidden-message-in-obamas-farewell-speech.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4982]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1025, "scraper_regex": 1080}}, "headline": "The hidden message in Obama's 'farewell' speech", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1080, "date": "20170111050000", "story_content": "Five days into the 1993 calendar \u2013 15 days before his White House stay concluded \u2013 George H.W. Bush traveled to West Point for one last presidential address.\n\nThe event was short on bells and whistles. Gray-uniformed Army cadets provided the backdrop. The event opened with the National Emblem March and wrapped up with the West Point March. Bush's reward for making the trek up the Hudson River: a cadet parka \u2013 a curious bit of clothing for a Navy man.\n\nBush 41 was all business that solemn day. He chose the venue to impart wisdom on what role the attending future warriors would play in global theatres. He chose not to pat himself on the back for peacefully concluding the Cold War and humiliating Saddam Hussein, but instead outlined America's commitments as a triumphant superpower in a reshaped world.\n\nFast-forward 14 years and five days to Chicago's Lakeside Center at McCormick Place and President Obama's Tuesday evening \"farewell address\" before an effusive crowd \u2013 the second time, now, that an outgoing president said goodbye in a venue beyond the nation's capital.\n\nTwo things you should know about Obama's last hurrah:\n\nFirst, it wasn't so much \"farewell\" as \"to be continued\".\n\nCome a week from Friday, Obama will be the first ex-president since Woodrow Wilson to stay in Washington once his administration ends.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Obama made it clear that, unlike the enfeebled Wilson (or the gracious George W. Bush, for that matter), he plans to be quite vocal \u2013 on everything from illegal immigration, replacing ObamaCare, climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal \u2013 if he feels the necessity.\n\nSecond, Obama chose the moment and the setting (it's where he gave his victory speech on Election Night 2012) to bask in idolatry rather than say much that will stand the test of time.\n\nAs such, it was a disappointing finale to a presidency that, too often and in too many different ways, placed too high of a premium on celebrity status and cult of personality \u2013 an American colossus ruled by Narcissus.\n\nHere's a list of presidential farewell addresses, from the pre-modern written versions to this generation's televised goodbyes.\n\nThey include our nation's first President George Washington establishing a peaceful transfer of power, Andrew Jackson showcasing populism, Dwight Eisenhower warning of a \"military-industrial complex\" and Ronald Reagan embracing of a \"shining city on a hill\".\n\nThose and most other presidential farewell tended to be futuristic in their substance. Big-picture speeches.\n\nAnd Obama?\n\nHe did go big-picture in the beginning, tapping the Founding Fathers and the concept of a more perfect union and a republic defined by generational embraces of American exceptionalism. And he lamented the current \"state of democracy\" \u2013 Americans needing to set aside their differences for the good of the nation's solidarity.\n\nHowever, too much of the 54-minute address was devoted to a recitation and defense of a progressive record.\n\nObama talked up the broadening the definition of marriage, rebooting relations with Cuba and what he claims to be a healthier economy with poverty on the wane.\n\nOn the topic of inequality, he referenced \"a new social compound\" that's, in effect, a back door to more unionization, more social-program spending and higher taxation of the affluent.\n\nGet used to more of this. Part of Obama's post-presidency will include revamping Organizing for Action, a group born from his campaign machine and tasked with candidate recruitment.\n\nObama also claimed that race relations have improved over the recent decades, arguably his wobbliest words as (a) he removed his presidency from the equation and (b) in a city fraught with intra-racial homicides, it was just five days ago that four black Chicagoans were arrested for torturing a white special-needs teen live on Facebook.\n\nHowever, the topic of race was also one of Obama's stronger moments: calling on white Americans to better understand minority struggles with equality; minorities learning to better appreciate white struggles with a changing economy. \"We all have to try harder,\" he neatly surmised.\n\nStill, Obama couldn't resist the subtle dig at his successor (\"science and reason matter\") and the loyal opposition (\"how can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, not when we're cutting taxes for corporations?\"), even if it was cloaked in a nobler call for both parties to stop engaging in double standards.\n\nNot until nearly midway into his remarks did the only president to serve an entire two terms with a nation at war delve into terrorism.\n\nNot that it was much a deep dive.\n\nThe former constitutional law professor rolled ISIS into a big ball of human rights, women's right and LBGT rights \u2013 and from there, naturally, protecting voting rights and a closing passage in which Obama called for his countrymen to became a nation of community organizers. \u00a0\n\nAdd it up and, for one last time, America was witness to the Obama paradox. Twice, this very personable man was elected to the nation's highest office. He'll leave office with healthy approval numbers.\n\nYet on three separate occasions \u2013 two midterm elections and Hillary Clinton's ill-fated stab at \"hope\" and \"change\" \u2013 the American people rejected the man's ideas and ideology.\n\nOne good thing about star power, as Obama showed this one last time as president: it means not going unnoticed.\n\nBack in 2009, George W. Bush's press minions had to grovel for airtime for their boss's farewell address from the East Room of the White House. This time around, none of the three major television networks balked at granting Obama coverage live and in primetime.\n\nAnd good television it was.\n\nAs per usual, the words were melodic. The crowd was spellbound; a fawning media will swoon over the passages.\n\nBut with Obama it's always been a temporary high \u2013 a long, rhetorical nitrous oxide hit before returning to the sobering realities of a sluggish economy, flawed health care reform, a socially divided nation and a world stage dotted with bad actors.\n\nDespite the lofty language, the kind optics and the man's cool presence on stage, Obama's party paid a terrible price down-ticket in congressional, gubernatorial and state legislative numbers. Last November, the electorate handed the presidency to a man who's the anti-Obama in taste, temperament, experience and execution.\n\nSaying farewell can be hard \u2013 especially when one's party has been left in the dust.\n\n\n\nBill Whalen is a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, where he analyzes California and national politics.

John Kelly as his choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security.\u00a0\n\nKelly told Fox News Trump already has asked him to serve in the DHS position.\u00a0\n\n\"I have been asked and would consider it an honor,\" he said.\u00a0\n\nKelly would be the third general Trump has picked for his administration, after announcing James Mattis \u2013 who along with Kelly is a four-star general -- as his pick for Defense secretary. Trump also announced in November that retired Gen. Michael Flynn would be his national security adviser.\n\nKelly retired from the Marine Corps earlier this year after leading U.S. Southern Command for three years, during which he was involved in the oversight of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and the southern border.\n\nKelly was picked by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to serve as his senior military adviser and then served in the same position under Leon Panetta before moving to Southern Command.\n\nKelly complained at his last Pentagon press conference in January that after 40 years as a Marine he had the authority to watch drug dealers heading to the border by sea, but he could not disrupt them. He is believed to have a good relationship with current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, with whom he served as Pentagon general counsel.\n\nHe served three tours in Iraq, and holds the somber distinction of being the most senior military officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Marine 2nd Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in November, 2010, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.\n\nKnown as an outspoken but loyal commander, Kelly will be first to lead the department who is not a lawyer and the fifth overall. The department was formed after the 9/11 terror attacks in order to help foil future attacks on the American homeland.\n\nSources say Trump has settled on Kelly for the role, and is expected to name him in the next few days. Kelly's selection will require confirmation by the Senate.\u00a0\n\nImmigration enforcement is a familiar issue for Kelly, and a big part of the DHS portfolio. Southern Command, which is based in South Florida, regularly works with DHS on missions to identify and dismantle immigrant smuggling networks. And it has partnered with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an operation targeting human smuggling into the U.S. and helped with the rescue of children arriving alone at U.S. borders.\n\nWhile Trump has tapped military officials for key appointments, doing so can also bring complications. Gen. Mattis will need to secure a waiver from Congress in order to be considered due to a requirement that military officials be out of service for seven years before being secretary of Defense.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, said Wednesday that he has taken, and acted on, advice from President Obama on who he should appoint to various positions in his administration.\n\n\"I have asked him what he would think of this one and that one,\" Trump said on NBC's \"Today\" show. \"I would say that, yes, I take his recommendations very seriously and there are some people that I will be appointing, and in one case have appointed, where he thought very highly of that person, yes.\"\n\nWhile he did not go into specifics, he said that he likes Obama \"as a person\" despite the brutal criticism he leveled at the president on the campaign trail.\n\n\"I will say this, I've now gotten to know President Obama. I really like him. ... I can't speak for him, but we have a really good chemistry together. We talk,\" Trump said.\n\nA coziness between current and former presidents is not unusual. President George H.W. Bush wrote President Bill Clinton a warm note when Clinton took office, while President Obama has repeatedly spoken of how accommodating President George W. Bush's team was to Obama in the lead-up to him taking office in 2009.\n\nFox News' John Roberts and Jennifer Griffin and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.4577260017395, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 626, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.73936712242, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.15335463258786, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/05/trump-brings-back-media-bashing-but-does-want-war.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4314]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 630, "scraper_regex": 708}}, "headline": "Trump brings back media-bashing, but does he want war?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 708, "date": "20161205110000", "story_content": "It was just like old times, Donald Trump feeding off the energy of the crowd and denouncing the \"dishonest media.\"\n\nExcept\u2026the election is over. He won. Bigly.\n\nNow I don't begrudge the president-elect having a little fun at that Ohio rally, his first public trip outside of Trump Tower since Nov. 8. But does this mean slamming the press will become a permanent feature of his presidency?\n\nEvery commander-in-chief has the right to push back against what he views as unfair coverage, a privilege that President Obama repeatedly exercised when it came to Fox.\n\nBut does Trump want both sides on a permanently hostile footing?\n\nLook, Trump is entitled to complain about his heavily negative campaign coverage. \"We didn't have the press. The press was brutal,\" he said.\n\nAnd he drew blood while recalling, in a mock-anchor voice, the pundits repeatedly saying he had no path to 270, or that \"Texas is in play.\" He won Texas easily and wound up with 306 electoral votes.\n\nBut for a year and a half, Trump delighted his base by hitting the press hard, all in the service of winning an election. Now he has to govern. \n\nHe had been reaching out a bit, visiting the New York Times and inviting network executives and anchors for a chat, even though those conversations included some tough criticism.\n\nTrump has shown he has numerous ways to circumvent the media. He hasn't held a news conference since July (after all those months of castigating Hillary Clinton for avoiding such encounters). \n\nBut should the guy who did endless interviews during the campaign use the news business to sell his policies? Or has he concluded that the press is permanently against him and there's little point in cooperating?\n\nOne of his chief instruments for bypassing the MSM is, of course, Twitter. And that has led to one of those hand-wringing media debates, encapsulated by this New York Times headline: \"If Trump Tweets, Is It Always News?\"\n\n\"How to cover a president's pronouncements when they are both provocative and maddeningly vague?\" the paper asks. \"Does an early-morning tweet amount to a planned shift in American policy? Should news outlets, as some readers argue, ignore clearly untrue tweets, rather than amplify falsehoods further?\"\n\nThe story notes that some on social media want the media to boycott Trump's tweets. Nation Editor Katrina vanden Heuvel said, on Twitter naturally, \"Media would be wise to stop hyper-coverage of Trump's tweets \u2014 they distract, distort and debase.\"\n\n\nIt's fair to question whether the press made too much of Trump's single tweet suggesting that flag-burners be jailed or stripped of their citizenship. And I understand why news organizations went after the president-elect for tweeting, without evidence, that millions of people had voted illegally.\n\nBut everything a president puts out is news. Let's say Twitter didn't exist and Trump was posting 30-second videos online. Would journalists say they were too short and superficial to be covered? What if he sent out two-sentence press releases by, say, fax? Would the media blow them off as too superficial?\n\nRonald Reagan started the five-minute weekly radio address, and those made news for him and subsequent presidents. And as Chris Wallace pointed out to the Times, he reported it when Reagan would offer a brief response to a shouted question as he walked to the helicopter.\n\nAfter Trump stirred up the media and angered China by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan's president, he tweeted: \"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.\" He had a point--and that is undoubtedly news.\n\nOf course, he also tweeted that \"SNL\" was \"unwatchable\" and \"totally biased,\" and the Alec Baldwin impersonation \"just can't get any worse.\" That's not international news, but it shows why people keep reading him.\n\nThe media are still figuring out how to cover this most unorthodox of presidents. And he has to figure out what kind of relationship he wants with them.\n\n\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Speaker Paul Ryan was elected to a full term in the post Tuesday afternoon.\u00a0\n\nBut GOP leaders worked quickly to resolve the dispute with Trump after he challenged fellow Republicans Tuesday morning on the ethics office plan. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., held a short meeting and moved to pull the language. \u00a0\n\nThe semi-independent ethics body was created in 2008 to investigate allegations of misconduct by lawmakers after several bribery and corruption scandals sent members to prison. Under the change initially pushed by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., the non-partisan office would fall under the oversight of the House Ethics Committee, which is run by lawmakers.\n\nWhile Democrats decried the plan, Trump earlier took to Twitter to nudge Republicans to focus more on repealing ObamaCare, pursuing tax reform and other priorities.\n\nHe wrote: \"With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it \u2026 may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!\"\n\nThe ethics change that had been sought by House Republicans Monday was part of a rules package that the full House will vote on Tuesday. The package also includes a means for Republican leaders to punish lawmakers if there is a repeat of the Democratic sit-in last summer over gun control.\n\nThe House still plans to vote on the overall rules package \u2013 but GOP leaders plan to deal with the ethics issue later, sometime before the August recess.\n\nSpeaker Ryan, R-Wis., and Majority Leader McCarthy already had argued against making a unilateral ethics change in a meeting on Monday, pressing for a bipartisan approach at a later date, but rank-and-file Republicans defied their leadership.\n\nUnder the proposed ethics change, the office would be known as the Office of Congressional Complaint Review, and the rule change would require that \"any matter that may involve a violation of criminal law must be referred to the Committee on Ethics for potential referral to law enforcement agencies after an affirmative vote by the members,\" according to Goodlatte's office.\n\nLawmakers would have the final say on their colleagues under the change.\n\nDemocrats, led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, reacted angrily.\n\n\"Republicans claim they want to `drain the swamp,' but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions,\" the California Democrat said in a statement. \"Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress.\"\n\nIn a statement, Goodlatte said the rules amendment \"builds upon and strengthens the existing Office of Congressional Ethics by maintaining its primary area of focus of accepting and reviewing complaints from the public and referring them, if appropriate, to the Committee on Ethics.\"\n\nBut others said the new system would make it easier for corruption to flourish under Ryan and his leadership team.\n\nThe OCE was created in March 2008 after the cases of former Rep. Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham, R-Calif., who served more than seven years in prison on bribery and other charges; as well as cases involving former Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, who was charged in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal and pleaded guilty to corruption charges, and former Rep.

His potential solution: Take state government out of marriage completely.\n\n\"You can stop spending so much emotional energy on the issue, and we can move on to other things,\" state Rep. T.J. Berry said, adding, \"I'm treating everybody the exact same way and leaving space for people to believe what they believe outside of government.\"\n\nHis bill, filed ahead of the 2017 legislative session, would make Missouri the first state to recognize only domestic unions for both heterosexual and gay couples, treating legal partnerships equally and leaving marriages to be done by pastors and other religious leaders.\n\nBut such peace could be elusive for several reasons. Some argue that leaving marriage to religious leaders is a way to constitutionally refuse to perform ceremonies for same-sex couples. Plus, there are potential logistical issues with stripping references to marriage in hundreds of state statutes, and the federal government recognizes only marriages for benefits. Berry's idea has been met by skepticism from pretty much all sides of the gay marriage issue.\n\nOther states including Alabama, Indiana and Michigan failed to pass similar bills to limit the government's role in marriage, and Oklahoma representatives passed a bill that didn't make it out of the Senate.\n\nThe Missouri bill's chances are unclear, although Republican House Majority Floor Leader Mike Cierpiot, who lives 30 minutes south of Kansas City in Lee's Summit, said the issue needs to be discussed due to impassioned arguments among LGBT rights groups and religious organizations that have continued in the wake of the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage.\n\nThe bill is backed by states' rights group Tenth Amendment Center, whose spokesman Mike Maharrey called it a \"great compromise\" and referenced county clerks in other states, such as Kentucky, who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n\"It removes that type of battle of conscience,\" he said.\n\nWhile the bill \"would treat all couples the same\" \u2014 at least in Missouri \u2014 the legal director for the national LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign highlighted a significant issue. The federal government does not recognize domestic partnerships or other alternative unions, so Missouri's same-sex and opposite-sex couples would need to get married in another state to receive federal benefits regarding taxation, social security and military spousal benefits, Sarah Warbelow said.\n\nBerry, who's from Kearney, about 30 minutes north of Kansas City, said he's seeking guidance from the federal government.\n\nThe bill also doesn't address the heart of tension between religious groups and gay rights groups: whether same-sex couples should have the right to wed.\n\nMembers of the Missouri Baptist Convention are concerned that endorsing Berry's measure would be seen as accepting the Supreme Court's ruling, policy director Don Hinkle said.\n\n\"We believe that the Bible is literally the words of God, and we're to keep his commandments,\" Hinkle said. \"And he makes it very clear that marriage is to be only between a man and a woman.\"\n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty said the issue was settled at the federal level, calling the bill \"absolutely unnecessary.\" She also warned that the whopping 386-page bill has unknown consequences, potentially causing problems for couples in domestic unions who move out of state.\n\nAnd there's the possibility that the measure could chip away at the significance of marriage.\n\n\"If you replace marriage with domestic union, will people still take that contract as seriously?\" Missouri Catholic Conference Executive Director Mike Hoey said.\n\nMost Americans \"don't want marriage to disappear,\" Warbelow said.\n\n\"There is something about marriage,\" she said. \"People don't grow up dreaming about being in civil unions or domestic partnerships.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Summer Ballentine on Twitter: @esballentine\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.0115606784820599, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 613, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.3914448069, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161230070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.75203915171289, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/12/03/ca-woman-found-chained-and-branded-kidnappers-described-as-hispanic/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [100]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 786, "scraper_regex": 840}}, "headline": "CA woman found chained and branded -- kidnappers described as 2 Hispanic women", "wordcount_as_scraped": 840, "date": "20161203170000", "story_content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  \u2013 \u00a0Three weeks after Sherri Papini disappeared, the question of whether she was dead or alive was answered when the young mother and wife was spotted waving frantically for help along a California freeway early on Thanksgiving morning. But the mystery over what happened to her during those 22 days just seemed to grow stranger.\n\nShe was battered and bruised, her hands were chained, her long blond hair had been chopped off, and her flesh had been branded with a threatening message. The 34-year-old Papini told authorities that she had been kidnapped at gunpoint by two women Nov. 2 while she was out for a run near her home.\n\nThe bizarre turn of events \u2014 with many of the most sensational details released not by authorities but by her husband in an exclusive interview with ABC \u2014 has baffled police and set social media aflutter, with armchair detectives scouring the internet's darkest corners for clues and others arguing that the case is some kind of twisted hoax, like something out of the movie \"Gone Girl.\"\n\nHer husband, Keith Papini, has condemned the rumors as \"exhausting and disgusting,\" and police have said they have no reason to doubt his wife's harrowing account. But they have a multitude of questions, among them: Who are these women? Where did they keep her? Was she selected at random or targeted?\n\nAnd, most of all, why?\n\nNo ransom demand was ever received, and neither the Papinis nor their families are wealthy, according to Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko. She is a stay-at-home mom, he a Best Buy store employee.\n\nDetectives are tracking hundreds of leads but haven't elicited much information from Papini and have only the sketchiest description from her of her captors, who were said to be Hispanic. Authorities have not divulged the message burned into her skin, and she hasn't been seen publicly since she was found.\n\n\"Sherri did her best that she could in providing the descriptions, but she was not able to provide a detailed description due to the suspects covering their faces, and at times Sherri's head was covered,\" the sheriff said. He noted also that victims of traumatic experiences sometimes suffer memory loss.\n\nAmong the leads detectives are following up on is a 13-year-old blog post on a white supremacist site signed by someone using Papini's maiden name. The post claimed she and her family had white supremacist beliefs and disliked Latinos.\n\n\"We do not know that it has any relevance to this case or not,\" Bosenko said Wednesday.\n\nPapini's former husband, David Dreyfus, defended her, saying it must have been written by someone else.\n\n\"People are bullies, and it's easy to poke at people online,\" Dreyfus told The Sacramento Bee. \"With as diverse of a friends group as she and I had, that's not her.\"\n\nPapini said she was seized about mile from her rural home outside Redding, 215 miles north of San Francisco. She was found in Yolo County, about 140 miles from home, telling authorities that her captors shoved her out of an SUV near Interstate 5 with a bag over her head. Her hands were bound to a chain around her waist.\n\nKeith Papini said his wife's nose was broken and she was emaciated, weighing 87 pounds, or 13 pounds less than her normal weight. As for her hair, \"obviously, a very sick person who may have wanted to not only to cut it off to change her physical appearance but also as to humiliate them, wear her down,\" Bosenko told ABC.\n\nShe said her kidnappers spoke mostly Spanish. She said one was older, with straight dark hair and thick eyebrows, while the younger one had long curly hair and pierced ears.\n\nAnother curious part of the story has been the role played by a self-described \"international kidnap and ransom consultant\" named Cameron Gamble. Gamble posted a video offering an undisclosed amount of money as a \"ransom\" for Papini's safe return.\n\nThen, when he got no response, Gamble posted another video offering the money as a reward for information leading to the kidnappers. He said the sum was put up by a concerned person who wanted to remain anonymous.\n\nPapini turned up free the next morning, with Gamble claiming that his reward had put pressure on the kidnappers. Police said they don't believe it had anything to with her release.\n\nPapini's husband was considered a suspect until he passed a polygraph test, the sheriff said, and friends and family have described her as happily married and a devoted mother of two.\n\nStill, police have been upset by some of the husband's actions, including contacting Gamble for help and divulging details of her injuries to media. Bosenko said the release of the details could compromise the investigation and the ransom offer could hinder it by bringing out scam artists.\n\nKeith Papini, for his part, lashed out at the \"rumors, assumptions, lies and hate\" that have circulating, saying: \"Those people should be ashamed of their malicious, subhuman behavior.\"\n\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.9096174240112305, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 786, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.28784387637, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161203170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9262086513994903, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/19/america-must-act-in-syria-even-after-aleppo.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [386, 529, 530, 1392, 3826, 5258]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 780, "scraper_regex": 857}}, "headline": "America must act in Syria even after Aleppo", "wordcount_as_scraped": 857, "date": "20161219190000", "story_content": "A patchwork of Iranian-led militias fighting for Syrian president Bashar al Assad is completing its brutal conquest of northerly Aleppo City, near the Turkish border. American policymakers have now begun to speculate \u2013hope is more accurate-that perhaps the Syrian civil war is effectively over, except for the ugly mopping up. They are wrong. \u00a0\n\nAleppo is a turning point in the war, but it does not decrease the necessity, long avoided by the Obama administration, for the U.S. to act.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSurviving anti-Assad forces in Syria will not surrender simply because Aleppo has fallen. Some fighters will abandon the battlefield; many will be killed or disappear into Assad's prisons. But most surviving anti-Assad combatants will continue to fight-- as ISIS's recapture of Palmyra further to the east, demonstrates.\n\nThe more realistic analysis of the rapid fall of Aleppo in the past few weeks is that rather than fight a losing battle in the city, many groups have decided to preserve their resources for what comes next.\n\nIn southern Syria, anti-Assad opposition remains strong and committed to fighting him despite the relative quiet of that battlefront in recent months. And in northern Syria, surviving anti-Assad fighters still have two options.\n\nFirst, they can join a relatively new coalition on the battlefield organized by neighboring Turkey. \u00a0Turkey is giving priority to fighting Kurdish forces, including some backed by the United States, as well as fighting ISIS. Many of Aleppo's rebels will be willing to accept these short-term delays in their war against Assad in return for Turkish backing that will allow them to survive and fight Assad another day.\n\nSecond, the opposition can join with al Qaeda and its Syrian jihadist ally, Ahrar al Sham. These extremist groups are consolidating and preparing to supplant the original goals of the Syrian rebellion \u2013 a negotiated settlement of the war, a release of political prisoners, and the departure of Assad \u2013 with a global jihad.\n\nThe size of the combined jihadist force is at least 20,000 fighters, greater than the most recent estimates of ISIS's numbers across both Syria and Iraq. They will hold a defensive line for now, but will launch an offensive of their own once they have collected enough strength.\n\nThe jihadist groups' next target will most likely be Hama City, about 75 miles south of Aleppo. Hama has symbolic value as the site of a historic massacre of Muslim Brotherhood members and civilians by Bashar al Assad's father, Hafez, in 1982.\n\nMeantime, Al Qaeda will continue its efforts to execute attacks abroad, likely with increasing support from Syrians.\n\nPro-Assad forces cannot eliminate either al Qaeda or ISIS, even after their success in Aleppo. The main reason is that Assad's only truly effective fighting forces are not his own but those his external backers, Iran and Russia, have provided or supported.\n\nEven then, Assad barely succeeded in Aleppo. Iran's militia forces took thousands of casualties. They only won because of the unique military pressure they could bring, through aerial attacks and artillery fire, on the civilian population inside already-destroyed urban terrain, and because anti-Assad fighters chose not to fight for each city block.\n\nThe pro-Assad alliance cannot replicate these conditions in the Syrian countryside. Iran and Russia may continue to reinforce Assad with ground forces in the near term, but they cannot provide enough troops to reconquer western Syria.\n\nEarly reports indicate that Russia is now deploying loyal elite Chechen fighters, likely to attack the northwestern town of Jisr Shughour, a jihadist stronghold that threatens core pro-Assad territory along the Syrian coast.\n\nThey may succeed, although jihadists will fight hard to prevent the advance. \u00a0Assad likely will also finish consolidating his grip on the Syrian capital of Damascus, whose countryside has been an opposition stronghold.\n\nNeither the Chechen nor Iranian reinforcements are suitable long term holding forces, however. The pro-Assad alliance will continue to grandstand internationally to create the appearance of an end to the war but anti-Assad groups will persist and regenerate.\n\nAs the conflict continues to drag on past his inauguration day, then-President Trump must avoid the temptation to stay away entirely from Syria. He must also avoid the trap of reaching automatically for new partners without considering who can actually help us pursue our interests.\n\nThese interests are going to include defending ourselves against jihadist attacks, but also preventing further expansion of an Iranian- and Russian backed sphere of influence that threatens world order.\n\nAny U.S. policy in Syria must weigh all of these considerations and recognize that America is the only country that can pursue American interests. There is no easy out, as our passive policymakers may now be dreaming.\n\nIt would be a moral, strategic, and logical failure of epic proportions to place our bets on Assad's house of cards simply because we are too afraid to develop a strategy of our own.\n\n\n\nJennifer Cafarella is Lead Intelligence Planner at the Institute for the Study of War.

More than two years of extremist rule and weeks of clashes between the Islamic State group and Iraqi forces have turned Abed's house into a bunker, like the dwellings of many of their neighbors.\n\n\"It's like living in a prison,\" he said.\n\nMonths after IS swept into Shura, the militants killed Abed's brother because he was a police officer. Last week, another relative died in an airstrike intended to liberate the village.\n\nAbed and his wife, Suriyah, hung thick curtains in their windows to prevent fighters from seeing inside. As shelling and airstrikes broke window panes in their living room, they replaced them with wooden and plastic panels. All the while, Iraqi advances in the south initially made food more expensive, then unavailable altogether.\n\n\"If (the Iraqi forces) didn't come today or tomorrow, we would have died,\" Suriyah said.\n\nWhile the fight on Mosul's eastern front has moved at a brisk, steady pace since the offensive formally began Oct. 17, the ground assault to the south has been a grinding slog.\n\nThe Nineveh desert south of Mosul along the Tigris River valley is dotted with dozens of populated villages that have repeatedly slowed down Iraqi forces. In the three months since the military began moving its forces into the valley and retook a nearby air base, the southern front line has moved only 24 kilometers (15 miles).\n\nThe country's elite special forces \u2014 the most experienced and professional of Iraq's ground troops \u2014 have largely been moving through villages east of Mosul that were long emptied of civilians. With fewer chances of casualties, heavy airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition and Iraqi artillery have helped clear territory and speed progress.\n\nThe operation that pushed IS out of Shura \u2014 a village of fewer than 1,000 houses about 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Mosul \u2014 required days of preparation and about 2,000 Iraqi army and federal police to take on no more than 50 militants.\n\nThe methodical assault was intended to minimize casualties among Iraq's armed forces \u2014 a military force still recovering from the catastrophic defeat suffered in Mosul's fall in 2014. But it also has meant that humanitarian conditions in IS-held territory have deteriorated and are almost like a siege, putting civilians at risk.\n\nThe region has long been a hub for insurgents, their finance networks and anti-government sentiment following the U.S-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. When U.S. forces battled al-Qaida in Iraq \u2014 the predecessor to the Islamic State group \u2014 on these same desert plains, the fighters repeatedly fell back into Mosul and nearby villages to regroup.\n\nOn the outskirts of the Shura operation, federal police Brig. Gen. Fakher Ali watched the progress of the offensive on a tablet displaying a satellite map, with about two dozen red dots marking suspected IS positions that were hit by airstrikes or artillery. When his forces are fired on by a suspected sniper, they halt their convoy and wait for artillery to clear the position, he said.\n\nIn the days before the assault, Iraqi forces watched via coalition surveillance drones as hundreds of IS fighters withdrew northward from Shura, taking thousands of civilians with them, said federal police Lt. Col. Hussein Nazim.\n\n\"Each time we approach, they almost all flee,\" he said, explaining that the militants leave behind only a small unit instructed to fight to the death.\n\nThe majority of fighters escape before the slow-moving Iraqi assault begins, he said, melting back into residential areas still under militant control and increasingly using civilian captives as human shields.\n\n\"This isn't something where you can say, 'if we move slowly, airpower and artillery power are going to deal with the issues,' because it also gives ISIS time to consolidate,\" said Anthony Cordesman, a former adviser to the U.S.-led training effort of Iraqi forces and currently a security analyst with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nHaving the ability to pull back and regroup repeatedly is allowing a relatively small number of IS fighters to punch above their weight and delay overwhelming numbers of Iraqi troops, Cordesman said.\n\nIn the wake of Iraqi advances, local tribal and militia fighters have largely taken over security in recently \"liberated\" Nineveh province as Iraq's military is increasingly stretched thin. Largely operating in a power vacuum, the local forces have already been accused of abusing civilians fleeing IS-held territory.\n\nGen. David Petraeus, who commanded U.S. forces in Mosul in 2003, relied heavily on local forces to secure Nineveh province.\n\n\"As quickly as we could, we consolidated those forces and put them underneath either the police or the military,\" he said.\n\nBut the situation was entirely different back then, because he had some 20,000 highly trained U.S. troops at his disposal, Petraeus added.\n\n\"I was sort of the sheikh of the strongest tribe,\" he said, \"Today, there's no comparable figure in Nineveh province.\"\n\nA few kilometers (miles) back from the front-line fighting south of Mosul, a group of Iraqi soldiers played patriotic music in their Humvees, snapped photos with mobile phones and cheered on the artillery blasts rocking a cluster of dusty, low houses on the horizon.\n\nStanding to the side of the noisy onlookers, Iraqi army Sgt. Rakan Nasser's eyes welled with tears. His wife and young children are trapped in Mosul, and as the fight pushed closer, his worries grew for their safety.\n\nNasser said he's able to talk to them every few weeks, depending on cellphone coverage.\n\n\"They just say, 'we're waiting for you to reach us,'\" he said, \"I tell them we are very near, but honestly, we are far.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.07371473312378, "HarmVice": 13, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 896, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.77245344023, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161102070000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.90178571428571, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/29/zika-to-weed-8-huge-health-stories-from-2016.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [187, 194, 1195, 1398, 1407, 1491, 1496, 1582, 1593, 2057, 2091, 2348, 2520, 2525, 2862, 2870, 3009, 3037, 3068, 3075, 3112, 3142, 3771, 3796, 3913, 3934, 4279, 4358, 4372, 4513, 4576, 4594, 4695, 4717, 4930, 4940, 5434, 5445, 5831, 5849, 6113, 6127, 6559, 6567, 6873, 6879, 7078, 7568, 7594, 7610, 7613, 7616, 7619, 7622, 7625, 7628, 7631, 7634]}}, "headline": "Zika to weed: 8 huge health stories from 2016", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1216, "date": "20161229210000", "story_content": "From the elimination of measles in the U.S. to the advance of potential new treatments for Alzheimer's disease, 2016 was a jam-packed year for\u00a0health\u00a0news. \n\nHere are eight of the most noteworthy health news stories from this year:\n\nAlthough the Zika virus was identified in 1947, it erupted onto the world scene in 2015, and moved into greater global consciousness with lightning speed over the past year.\n\nDuring the summer of 2016, local transmission of the Zika virus was seen in the U.S. for the first time, in a neighborhood near Miami. And in August, the National Institutes of Health announced that it had launched a clinical trial to test a vaccine to protect people against Zika infections.\n\nThese infections can be hard to spot, Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told Live Science. That's because 80 percent of people infected with the virus have no symptoms, and the other 20 percent usually have only mild symptoms, like fever and headaches, he said.\n\nThe primary danger of the virus, though, comes from the potential birth defects Zika causes when it infects pregnant women: Researchers\u00a0have linked the virus to microcephaly, a disorder in which babies are born with smaller-than-average heads. These babies then face lifelong disabilities.\n\nOn Nov. 18, 2016, the World Health Organization\u00a0declared\u00a0that Zika was no longer a global emergency. Even still, the virus has spread to the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0in areas like Florida and Texas, where Zika-infected mosquitoes now exist. Currently,\u00a0no vaccine\u00a0for Zika exists.\n\n\"Zika is here to stay in the Americas. It's going to be a part of our lives for years to come,\" Glatter told Live Science in February. \"We need to look at the time line and get a good idea of what the viruses are that are a threat to the human race, and invest in technologies and spot the trends early to become more proactive and less reactive.\"\n\nAn advance in the search for a treatment for Alzheimer's disease hit the stage in 2016: An early\u00a0study, published in August, found\u00a0that an investigational drug called aducanumab can significantly reduce the amount of amyloid beta plaque in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. This plaque consists of the tangled clumps of proteins that build up over time in the brains of people who have\u00a0Alzheimer's disease. The researchers concluded that the drug spurs the immune system to work to clear the plaques.\n\nAlthough the study was not designed to show whether the\u00a0drug\u00a0can improve people's cognitive abilities, the findings suggest that the drug does work this way, the researchers said.\n\n\"We believe that's a hint of efficacy,\" study co-author Dr. Alfred Sandrock said during a news briefing on the findings. Sandrock is a neurologist and executive vice president at Biogen, the Cambridge, Massachusetts,\u00a0company\u00a0that funded the trial and applied to patent the drug.\n\nMore research is needed to determine whether the drug affects patients' symptoms of\u00a0Alzheimer's, Sandrock said.\u00a0\n\nEarlier this year, the World\u00a0Health\u00a0Organization (WHO) declared that the\u00a0Ebola outbreak in West Africa\u00a0was no longer a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, signifying that the region was largely clear of the disease. The outbreak began in December 2013 and raged during 2014 and 2015, striking hardest in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where more than 28,000 people were infected. More than 11,000 people in the region died from the disease.\n\nDr. Bruce Aylward, WHO's special representative for the Ebola response, noted in a statement in January 2016 that efforts to prevent and track the disease were still underway, and that \"we still anticipate flare-ups and must be prepared for them.\n\nOn June 27 this year the\u00a0Supreme Court overturned\u00a0a Texas bill that had stated that doctors who perform abortions must have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.\u00a0The majority opinion\u00a0(decided 5-3) said that such requirements did not offer any medical benefits to women seeking abortions, given that \"abortion is one of the safest medical procedures performed in the United States.\"\n\nPatients who undergo the procedure in a clinic rarely require hospital admission, said the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\u00a0\n\nThis year, the EpiPen's skyrocketing price generated controversy. The device\u00a0allows people\u00a0to inject epinephrine into their systems to counteract life-threatening allergic reactions. But in 2016, the device's price had increased by\u00a0500 percent since 2009. Mylan, the company that sells EpiPens,\u00a0agreed in October\u00a0to pay a whopping $465 million to the Department of Justice (DOJ) after accusations that it had been\u00a0overcharging Medicaid\u00a0for the devices. As part of that settlement, Mylan did not have to admit to any wrongdoing, but worked with the Department of Justice to create a corporate integrity agreement.\n\nMylan CEO Heather Bresch said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0to the U.S. House of Representatives in September that \"the misconception about our profits is understandable and at least partly due to the complex environment in which pharmaceutical prices are determined.\"\n\nShe also detailed Mylan's plans to offer savings to EpiPen consumers, including offering the first generic version of the EpiPen.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Americans in nine states voted on whether to legalize marijuana, for either medical or recreational use, in their states. Now,\u00a0it's legal\u00a0to recreationally use marijuana in Alaska, California, Colorado, Oregon, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Washington and the District of Columbia. Plus, 21 other states allow people to use marijuana for medical purposes.\n\nIt's hard to say yet what effect all of the new laws might have, experts said. Dr. Tina Rizack, an oncologist at Women & Infants Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island,\u00a0told Live Science\u00a0in March that as the drug \"becomes more available, patients will ask more questions about its therapeutic value, and, hopefully, more research will be done to answer these questions.\"\n\nOn Sept. 27, the Pan American Health Organization (part of the United Nations)\u00a0declared that\u00a0measles was eliminated from the Americas. Essentially, this means that there are no more cases of measles originating in those countries and that any cases of measles that do arise in those locations come from outside the Americas, Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist and a senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Center for Health Security, told Live Science in September.\n\n\"What's keeping\u00a0measles\u00a0at bay right now in the Americas is our high vaccination rate,\" Adalja said. The World Health Organization recommended that countries have at least 80 percent of people living in cities and 95 percent of the entire population vaccinated against measles in order to prevent the spread of imported cases.\n\nA\u00a0study\u00a0on a new, experimental type of male birth control that involves hormone shots was halted early because of the high rate of side effects in men who received the shots. The men's side effects included\u00a0acne, pain at the injection site, increased sex drive and mood disorders \u2014 which garnered attention given their similarity to many side effects of female birth control.\n\n\"Although the injections were effective in reducing the rate of pregnancy, the combination of hormones needs to be studied more to consider a good balance between efficacy and safety,\" said study co-author Dr. Mario Philip Reyes Festin, a medical officer on the human reproduction team at the World Health Organization.\u00a0\n\nOriginally published on\u00a0Live Science.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.5117157697677601, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1174, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.9541957835000003, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 6, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.81090289608177, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/25/standing-rock-chairman-says-army-corps-to-close-camp-access.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [76]}}, "headline": "Standing Rock chairman says Army Corps to close camp access", "wordcount_as_scraped": 684, "date": "20161126040000", "story_content": "BISMARCK, N.D. \u2013 \u00a0The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said Friday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to close an area where people have been camping for months to protest the Dakota Access oil pipeline.\n\nDave Archambault said in a statement that he received a letter from the Corps, dated Friday, which says all lands north of the Cannonball River will be closed Dec. 5.\n\n\"The letter states that the lands will be closed to public access for safety concerns,\" Archambault said.\n\nRepresentatives from the Army Corps of Engineers didn't immediately return messages Friday seeking comment and verification of the letter.\n\nThe letter, provided by the tribe, says: \"To be clear, this means that no member of the general public, to include Dakota Access pipeline protesters, can be on these Corps lands.\"\n\nIt says anyone on land north of the river after Dec. 5 will be trespassing and may be prosecuted. It also says anyone who stays on the land does so at his or her own risk.\n\nThe letter, from Army Corps of Engineers Col. John Henderson, says the closure is necessary to protect the general public from violent confrontations between protesters and authorities and to protect demonstrators from illness, injury or death during North Dakota's harsh winter months. It also says that the area does not have necessary first responder services or facilities to protect people during the winter.\n\nA free speech zone will be set up south of the river.\n\nArchambault said the land to be closed includes the Oceti Sakowin camp, a sprawling encampment on Army Corps land about 50 miles south of Bismarck. For months, opponents of the four-state, $3.8 billion pipeline have been camping in the area to protest the pipeline.\n\nSome of the protests have resulted in violent confrontations and hundreds of arrests. A clash earlier this week near the main protest camp left a police officer and several protesters injured, including Sophia Wilansky, who suffered a serious arm injury and is in satisfactory condition in a Minneapolis hospital.\n\nThe Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes are fighting the Dakota Access project because they fear it will harm drinking water and cultural sites. Pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners disputes that and says the 1,200-mile pipeline through the Dakotas, Iowa and Illinois will be safe.\n\nThe pipeline is nearly complete outside of a stretch beneath a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota, just to the north of the Standing Rock reservation.\n\n\"Our Tribe is deeply disappointed in this decision by the United States, but our resolve to protect our water is stronger than ever,\" he said. He's asking pipeline opponents to continue to fight the pipeline's permitting process.\n\nMeanwhile, the leader of the Cheyenne River Sioux in South Dakota called for pipeline opponents to boycott businesses in North Dakota's capital, a move Bismarck's city administrator says is uncalled for and disappointing.\n\nThe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Council voted in September to not spend money in Bismarck and neighboring Mandan, and Chairman Harold Frazier at the time called on all tribal members to join the effort. Earlier this week, he sought to broaden the boycott to make a statement against what he calls \"heavy-handed, illegal and violent oppression\" of people who have protested against the pipeline for months.\n\nBismarck City Administrator Keith Hunke said Friday the boycott is disappointing given that the city's businesses aren't involved in the dispute. He said no businesses have reported an impact from boycotts and protest activity in the area is inconvenient, but hasn't cut into business's bottom lines.\n\n\"We've had some of our streets blocked for a period of time, but generally after a period of time the protesters disband and business gets back to normal,\" he said.\n\nMore than 560 protesters have been arrested since August in the Bismarck-Mandan area and at the main protest camp, including more than 30 at a Bismarck mall on Friday \u2014 one of the busiest days of the year. Police said protesters gathered for a prayer at Kirkwood Mall, and some refused to leave the entrance to a Target store when ordered.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 5, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.30136966705322, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 679, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.5345323321199995, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161126040000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.301914580265099, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/07/raging-oakland-warehouse-fire-trapped-victims-in-smoke-investigators-say.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [91]}}, "headline": "Raging Oakland warehouse fire trapped victims in smoke, investigators say", "wordcount_as_scraped": 594, "date": "20161208020000", "story_content": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2013 \u00a0The fire that killed 36 people during a party at an Oakland warehouse started on the ground floor and quickly raged, with smoke billowing into the second level and trapping victims whose only escape route was through the flames, federal investigators said Wednesday.\n\n\"The occupants were consumed by smoke before they could get out of the building,\" said Jill Snyder, special agent in charge of the San Francisco office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nShe also confirmed there were no sprinklers or fire alarm system in the building.\n\nOfficials previously said recovery efforts at the site had ended with the death toll remaining at 36.\n\nSnyder reiterated that investigators were examining a refrigerator and other possibilities as a potential source of the fire but had not reached any conclusions.

I'm concerned about a tragedy that could happen,\" she said. \"The city should come in and help, not shut it down.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.040650367736821, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 566, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.69945271807, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.1802120141342796, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/08/venezuelan-human-rights-activist-time-for-action-not-talk-as-our-citizens-continue-to-starve.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [135, 172, 219, 544, 597, 788, 879, 1065, 1189, 1249, 1349, 1560, 2264, 2551, 3191, 3385, 3607, 3811, 4248, 4404], "\u00ed": [4412]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 658, "scraper_regex": 724}}, "headline": "Venezuelan human rights activist: Time for action, not talk, as our citizens continue to starve", "wordcount_as_scraped": 724, "date": "20161208210000", "story_content": "Dialogue in life should be a good thing.\u00a0 Dialogue should lead to compromise.\u00a0 Dialogue should be an equalizer; a moderator.\u00a0 So why is the current dialogue between the Venezuelan dictator Maduro and the democratically elected opposition right now so cynical and dangerous?\n\nIf the core tenet of the dialogue were the replacement of the illegitimate dictatorial Maduro regime and the peaceful transition to democracy, then we would of course concur.\u00a0Anything else, however, is nothing short of a farce.\u00a0 \n\nLet us not forget that a constitutionally legal petition \u2013 with over two million signatures \u2013demanding a referendum on the president's rule has been stymied by the regime and its cronies.\u00a0 \n\nWe jumped though all the legal hoops only to have the path to freedom brutally blocked.\u00a0 It is important to understand that if the required referendum is held after 10 January 2017, then even if Maduro loses, he will be replaced by his deputy, and the regime will have won.\u00a0 \n\nThe current dialogue is mere filibustering, but without the democracy!\n\nDialogue for the sake of dialogue is bad enough.\u00a0 But what is happening now is actually weaponized dialogue.\u00a0\n\nEvery day the dialogue goes on, heels are dragged and the average Venezuelan continues to starve.\u00a0 \n\nProcrastination through conversations will not solve food and medicine shortages, nor will it remedy the street violence, nor will Venezuelans wake up suddenly enjoying their constitutional and human rights.\u00a0 \n\nFree and fair democratic elections are pushed further and further away.\n\nWhile we appreciate the positive intentions of the Vatican, one must never equate a dictatorial regime and a democratically elected opposition.

This sort of dialogue only incentivizes further hostage-taking, a sorry fact supported by yet even more arbitrary arrests in the last few weeks.\n\nLet's not forget the urgency of the situation.\u00a0 Caracas now has more monthly homicides than both Kabul and Baghdad. Our health system is disintegrating. Our justice system is non-existent. As for the economy, the International Monetary Fund\u00a0predicts that inflation will rise to nearly 500 percent this year and potentially by 2,200 percent in 2017.\n\nWhen time is of the essence, engaging in these talks is both a strategic mirage and a tactical mistake.\n\nIt is a\u00a0mistake to confuse peace with submission and surrender.\n\nAnd it is a mistake to confuse dialogue with justice.\n\nMillions of brave citizens have taken to the streets peacefully to demand a way out of this\u00a0crisis that is ending lives, dreams and financial savings with every day that passes. \n\nAll freedom loving Venezuelans must continue to stand united to defeat the dictatorship and rebuild Venezuela. Through international pressure and the implementation of the Democratic Charter of the OAS, and of course firm, sustained, civic citizen pressure in the streets of our country, Maduro can and will be defeated; and Venezuela can be saved.\u00a0\n\nSo it is time for Venezuelans to stand up and be counted because as dialogue continues, time (as well as food, medicine and toilet paper) is running out.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMar\u00eda Corina Machado, is one of the current leaders of the movement for democracy in Venezuela.

Some of the survivors were left permanently injured.\n\nTwo unqualified demolition contractors are serving long prison terms over the catastrophe. But building owner Richard Basciano, a New York speculator hoping to redevelop a block of seedy properties he had held for 20 years, was never charged. And his architect, Plato Marinakos, who hired the demolition contractor, testified under a grant of immunity.\n\nThe victims are now seeking damages from both men, along with the Salvation Army and others.\n\nLegal lion Richard Sprague argued Wednesday that Basciano was not involved in the demolition plan. Sprague served on Congressional panels investigating the John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King assassinations. Both he and his client are 91.\n\nPersonal injury lawyer Robert Mongeluzzi, who represents family members and survivors, reminded the jury that Basciano hired cut-rate workers when public safety was involved \u2014 but Sprague to defend his assets in court. Mongeluzzi has won nine-figure verdicts over deadly construction accidents, and millions more over a fatal duck boat crash in Philadelphia.\n\nThe people killed inside the thrift store included two young women dropping off donations, an immigrant grandmother shopping on the busy sale day to send clothes back home, and a store worker who often talked over coffee with heavy equipment operator Sean Benscop, one of the men convicted in his death.\n\nSprague, citing experts who testified during the four-month trial, said Benscop was either responsible for the collapse or \"the straw that broke the camel's back.\" Benscop used an excavator on the site that morning despite rules that an unbraced wall must be taken down by hand.\n\nGiven that neither Benscop nor Campbell have any assets \u2014 both were scraping to get by \u2014 the victims are looking past them for a payout, Sprague said.\n\n\"No way do they want justice. They seek revenge. And revenge can blind you,\" he said.\n\nMongeluzzi argued that Campbell and Benscop were so clueless they didn't understand the danger or realize they were most at risk. He said the Salvation Army kept the store open despite warnings about the ongoing demolition. A lawyer for the Salvation Army emphasized the charity's good deeds and called its staff blameless.\n\nCampbell \u2014 offered just $112,000 to demolish the four-story building on one of Philadelphia's busiest downtown streets \u2014 gutted the building from the inside, destabilizing it, rather than take it down floor by floor. He was sentenced to 15 to 30 years. Benschop, who was operating the machine despite taking Percocet and marijuana for medical problems, was sentenced to 7\u00bd to 15 years in prison. Both were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and other crimes.\n\nThe deaths led the city to tighten its requirements for demolition permits. A city inspector killed himself days after the collapse, although there was no evidence of wrongdoing on his part.\n\nThe jury is expected to begin deliberations Monday.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -9.05923366546631, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 514, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.08100420768, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.8910505836575897, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/13/definitions-comfort-women-reveal-japan-s-korea-divide.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [67]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 853, "scraper_regex": 915}}, "headline": "Definitions of 'comfort women' reveal Japan-S.

Since then, the two countries have been divided over how badly Japan treated comfort women and how it should atone for past behavior.\n\nThat hasn't changed despite a 2015 agreement intended to resolve differences. After South Korean activists installed a \"comfort woman\" statue in front of the Japanese consulate in the South Korean port city of Busan, Japan announced last week that it would temporarily recall its ambassador to South Korea and suspend economic talks.\n\nThe divide is reflected in the term \"comfort women\" itself. Both countries use it, but it means different things to each:\n\n___\n\nWHO ARE THE \"COMFORT WOMEN\"?\n\nThe original Japanese word, \"ianfu,\" (pronounced EE-an-foo) is a euphemism for women sent to front-line brothels called \"comfort stations.\" Recruited or captured in Japan, the Korean Peninsula, China, the Philippines and Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia, they were used by hundreds of brothels supervised by the military, which set the tariffs, service hours and hygiene standards. The idea was to prevent venereal diseases and avoid triggering anti-Japanese sentiment by deterring Japan's troops from raping local women.\n\nJapan says there is no official record of the number of comfort women. Estimates by Japanese historians range from 20,000 to 200,000 depending on the parameters used. Initially, some were adult prostitutes or women from poor Japanese families, historians say. Later in the war, many non-Japanese, sometimes minors, were kidnapped or tricked into working in the brothels, some victims have said.\n\nJapan and South Korea also used their own comfort women for American GIs after the war. Japan's government set up brothels soon after its surrender in 1945 for U.S. servicemen pouring into the country and hired as many as 70,000 Japanese prostitutes, though Gen. Douglas MacArthur closed them in 1946. Seoul had a similar system for American troops during the Korean War. In 2014, more than 100 of the South Korean comfort women filed a lawsuit against their own government, demanding restoration of human dignity and compensation; that lawsuit remains pending.\n\n___\n\nWHAT TERM MEANS IN JAPAN\n\nIn Japan, comfort women initially were considered victims of World War II atrocities and thought to have come mainly from South Korea and the Philippines. Dozens from the two countries regularly visited Japan demanding official government apologies and compensation mainly in the 1990s-2000s. Years of continuous pressure for apologies have soured the initial sympathy, though, and many Japanese have grown weary of reminders of their country's wartime past.\n\nSome argue the women were not coerced but volunteered to be prostitutes for the military. During Shinzo Abe's first term as prime minister in 2006-2007, his Cabinet adopted an official line that there was a lack of documentary proof the women were forcibly recruited or put to work in the wartime brothels. In 2016, Abe told a parliamentary session that replacing the term \"ianfu\" with \"sex slaves\" was inaccurate and said the widely used estimation of 200,000 women was groundless. Abe expressed his sympathy for the women, but described them as victims of human trafficking. He has repeatedly denied the women were coerced into sexual slavery. Japan has lobbied the United Nations to remove the word \"sex slaves\" from documents related to the issue. Japan's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri, apologized in 2014 for using the expression \"sex slaves\" in its English edition in the past, promising not to use it again.\n\nJapan issued an apology in 1993 and a government investigation concluded many women were taken against their will and \"lived in misery under a coercive atmosphere.\" A fund set up in 1995 paid nearly 5 billion yen ($44 million) for medical and welfare projects for more than 280 of the women, including 61 South Koreans. Many victims in that country rejected the fund money under their powerful support group's stance to keep seeking further official apologies. Japan maintains all its wartime compensation issues with South Korea have been settled by a 1965 treaty.\n\n___\n\nWHAT TERM MEANS IN SOUTH KOREA\n\nMost South Koreans prefer the term \"comfort women\" even though it is adopted from their former colonial ruler. Critics of the euphemism say it makes light of the women's suffering, but the victims themselves generally have preferred it, perceiving more stigma from being called sex slaves. South Korea was a more deeply conservative society and talking publicly about sex-related topics was taboo in the 1990s, when the women began revealing their long-hidden experiences.\n\nThe South Korean government uses the phrase \"comfort women of the Japanese military\" to reflect the victims' preferences. The main support group for the women that organizes weekly protests outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul uses \"comfort women\" in its Korean-language documents, with an explanation of the meaning. It uses the phrase \"military sexual slavery by Japan\" in English statements.\n\n\"I personally hope we don't call them 'comfort women.' When Americans or other foreigners hear this term, I think they would say, 'What's that?'\" said Jung Hye-kyung, an expert on Japanese colonial abuses.\n\nOf the 239 South Korean women who officially registered themselves as comfort women, to obtain subsidies and benefits, only 40 are still alive. Experts believe many others have never come forward.\n\n___\n\nKim reported from Seoul, South Korea.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.6093418598175, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 853, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 4, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.3775812419299998, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.2274325908557997, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/28/analysis-for-some-in-middle-class-trump-plan-would-mean-tax-increase.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3978, 5660, 7039]}}, "headline": "Analysis: For some in middle class, Trump plan would mean tax increase", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1091, "date": "20161128060000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump's proposals would modestly cut income taxes for most middle-class Americans. But for nearly 8 million families -- including a majority of single-parent households -- the opposite would occur: They'd pay more.\n\nMost married couples with three or more children would also pay higher taxes, an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found. And while middle-class families as a whole would receive tax cuts of about 2 percent, they'd be dwarfed by the windfalls averaging 13.5 percent for America's richest 1 percent.\n\nTrump's campaign rhetoric had promoted the benefits of his proposals for middle-income Americans.\n\n\"The largest tax reductions are for the middle class,\" said Trump's \"Contract With the American Voter,\" released last month.\n\nThe tax hikes that would hit single parents and large families would result from Trump's plan to eliminate the personal exemption and the head-of-household filing status. These features of the tax code have enabled many Americans to reduce their taxable income.\n\nHis other proposed tax changes would benefit middle- and lower-income Americans. But they wouldn't be enough to offset those modifications.\n\n\"If you're a low- or moderate-income single parent, you're going to get hurt,\" said Bob Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nUnlike Trump's polarizing proposals on immigration and trade, his tax plan is in line with traditional Republican policy. His steep tax cuts in many ways resemble those carried out by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, and the Republican-run Congress is expected to welcome them.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump said his tax cuts -- for individuals and companies -- would energize the economy by boosting business investment in factories and equipment, while leaving consumers with more cash to spend. His proposals, he contended, would help create 25 million jobs over the next decade.\n\nBut Lily Batchelder, a visiting fellow at the Tax Policy Center and former deputy director of President Barack Obama's National Economic Council, estimates that roughly 7.9 million families with children would pay higher taxes under his proposals. About 5.8 million are led by single parents.\n\nAn additional 2.1 million are married couples.\n\nOther analysts, including economists at the conservative Tax Foundation and right-of-center American Enterprise Institute, have agreed with Batchelder's conclusions.\n\nHere's what her analysis finds:\n\nRight now, a single parent with $75,000 in income and two children can claim a head of household deduction of $9,300, plus three personal exemptions. Those steps would reduce the household's taxable income by $21,450, to $53,550.\n\nTrump's plan would more than double the standard deduction to $15,000. But that change would be outweighed by his elimination of personal exemptions and head-of-household status. So the family's taxable income would be $60,000, and their tax bill would be $2,440 more than it is now.\n\nA married couple with four children and income of $50,000 would absorb a tax increase of $1,090 because of their loss of personal exemptions.\n\nTrump's advisers deny that he will raise taxes on middle-income Americans. Stephen Miller, his top policy adviser, said Trump would provide tax-free child care savings accounts and other provisions to enable some families to reduce taxes.\n\nBut Batchelder's analysis found that those provisions wouldn't be enough to offset the plan's other elements that would increase taxes for some middle income households.\n\nMore broadly, Miller said Trump would instruct Congress to avoid raising taxes on those families.\n\n\"We will cut taxes massively for the middle class and working class,\" Miller said.\n\nKelly Rodriguez, 47, who lives in Tampa, Florida, voted for Trump and is a single mother who claims two of her four children as dependents.\n\n(Her ex-husband claims the other two.) She made roughly $90,000 \u00a0last year, including alimony payments. Her taxes would likely rise under Trump's plan, according to Batchelder's analysis.\n\n\"I would want him to explain that to me,\" she said. \"Taxes have to make sense to the people paying them.\"\n\nStill, Trump's plan will likely evolve during congressional negotiations before it becomes law.\n\n\"This is not anywhere close to a final plan,\" Williams said.\n\nKyle Pomerlau, director of federal projects at the conservative Tax Foundation, noted that House Speaker Paul Ryan's own tax-cut proposal is similar to Trump's but wouldn't raise taxes on single-parent families. In theory, the two plans could be melded, and Trump's elimination of the head of household status could be dropped.\n\nBut leaving the head of household filing status and personal exemptions intact would lower tax revenue by $2.1 trillion over the next decade, the Tax Policy Center says.\n\nAll independent analyses show most of the benefit of Trump's plan flowing to the wealthiest Americans. Nearly half of Trump's tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent of earners, the Tax Policy Center found. Less than a quarter of the cuts would benefit the bottom 80 percent.\n\nTrump proposes to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. That would slash the top rate from the current 39.6 percent. He would repeal the estate tax, which affects only about 0.2 percent of estates -- those worth above $5.45 million.\n\nFor middle-income earners as a whole, the Trump proposals would cut taxes, even taking into account the increases on single-parent families. Those earning nearly $50,000 to about $83,000 -- the middle one-fifth \u00a0-- would receive an average cut of $1,010, according to the Tax Policy Center. That would lift their after-tax incomes 1.8 percent.\n\nBy contrast, the wealthiest 1 percent -- those earning over $700,000 -- would enjoy a tax cut averaging nearly $215,000, boosting their after-tax incomes 13.5 percent. And the richest 0.1 percent -- those making above $3.7 million -- would receive a bonanza: An average tax cut exceeding $1 million.\n\n\"Trump's campaign rhetoric may have been populist, but his tax plan isn't,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the policy center, wrote on its website.\n\nHis tax proposals suggest what may be a challenge for Trump's administration: Providing his middle- and working-class supporters with tangible signs of economic progress. Middle-income Americans already pay a relatively modest share of federal income taxes compared with the wealthy. That limits the scope of what tax cuts could do for them.\n\n\"The thing that he needs to worry about is making life better for his supporters, and that involves more than tax cuts,\" Williams said.\n\nMiddle class finances have also been squeezed by high and rising costs for health care, higher education and housing, noted Joseph Cohen, a sociologist at Queens College in New York City.\n\n\"We've been cutting taxes since Reagan, and things have been getting worse for the middle class since Reagan,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.042016983032231, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1044, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.10064005058, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161128060000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.44827586206897, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/20/at-home-ovulation-kit-relies-on-saliva-sample-to-help-women-track-fertility.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [895, 3692, 3950]}}, "headline": "At-home ovulation kit relies on saliva sample to help women track fertility", "wordcount_as_scraped": 658, "date": "20161220200000", "story_content": "After an unexpected pregnancy nearly killed Helen Denise, the New Jersey-based woman came up with a plan to help other women avoid a similar situation, while also assisting those who were trying to get pregnant: an at-home ovulation testing kit that uses saliva, rather than urine.\n\nDenise, CEO of HiLin Life Products and creator of KNOWHEN, said that when she was 40 she was under the false impression that she couldn't get pregnant. As a result, she was having unprotected sex with her partner which ended in an ectopic pregnancy. The experience left her shaken and determined to help other women better understand their bodies and fertility cycles.\n\n\"Women need to understand their body,\" Denise told FoxNews.com. \"Many women have no idea about the mystery of ovulation [but it's] simple if you know what's going on.\"\u00a0\n\nThe reusable kit, which is FDA-certified and boasts a 98.9 percent accuracy rate, identifies the five most fertile days of a woman's cycle by detecting the level of hormones in the saliva. Dr. Kecia Gaither, a double-board certified OB-GYN who did not work on the development of KNOWHEN, told FoxNews.com that saliva is more accurate than a urine sample because the results are not subject to other chemicals, like alcohol.\n\nWhen a woman is ovulating and levels of estrogen are elevated, the saliva becomes more saline in composition. To use the test, the user puts a drop of saliva on the kit's mini-ovulation microscope lens immediately after she wakes up\u2014before brushing her teeth or drinking coffee.\n\nUsers can interpret their results by looking at the type of pattern left on the lens by the dried saliva. Women who are not ovulating and are at the least fertile point in their cycle will see dots on the lens, while those who are nearing the beginning or end of their ovulation period will observe a few fern-like patterns. Women who are ovulating will observe defined fern-like patterns on the lens, which signals their most fertile period for the best chance of conceiving a child.\n\nFaith Kirkpatrick, who was in her early 30s when she and her husband decided to start their family, received the kit after a discussion with her mother. Kirkpatrick wasn't sure if she would have trouble conceiving before they began trying. She used the kit for the first and second month and said the results were pretty accurate and easy to read, but she wasn't regularly acting on them.\n\n\"The next month I was like, 'OK, we really want it to happen,'\" Kirkpatrick, who lives in Westchester, New York, told FoxNews.com. \"We were trying all week, every other day, and that was the month we got pregnant.\"\n\nKirkpatrick said the kit helped to alleviate much of the stress that she witnessed some of her friends who weren't tracking their cycle go through. Their daughter is now 2 and Kirkpatrick, 36, said she's ready to start using the kit again to plan their next pregnancy.\n\nWhile Gaither, who lives in New York and does perinatal consulting at St. Luke's Medical Center in Kansas, City, Missouri, said that while the test is a quick and easy at-home tool, it should not take the place of medical care if a woman has any underlying issues. She noted that results may be skewed for women who are obese, have been diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), have recently stopped using oral contraceptives or have been taking supplemental estrogen.\n\nDenise said she is thrilled that her product has helped women -- including her own daughter -- get pregnant, but added that it's also beneficial to women who are trying to avoid pregnancy or determine whether they are experiencing menopause. The kit\u00a0is available online and currently retails for $49.99. It's planned to hit store shelves early 2017 and includes a free mobile app so that women can log results and monitor their cycle through a simple calendar.\n\n\"I feel like I am on a mission,\" Denise said.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.02960097789764, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 643, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.655554777357, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 5, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.777604976671851, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.45454545454499995}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/07/pearl-harbor-ceremonies-take-place-across-nation.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [78, 533]}}, "headline": "Pearl Harbor ceremonies take place across the nation", "wordcount_as_scraped": 558, "date": "20161208000000", "story_content": "COLLEGE STATION, Texas  \u2013 \u00a0It was a somber day Wednesday at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum, where hundreds gathered to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the attacks on Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe \"day that will go down in infamy\" hits especially close to home for former President George H.W. Bush, who was a senior in high school at the time. The gravity of what happened is what compelled him to temporarily forego his college plans and join the United States military.\u00a0\n\n\"We gotta do something about this,\" recalled President Bush, in an op-ed article published by USA Today.\n\nBush went on to become the youngest naval pilot of his time, commissioned just a few days before his 19th birthday. Then on September 2, 1944, the plane he was flying came under enemy fire and was hit. The former president managed to safely bail from his burning aircraft and was later plucked from a raft, in the middle of the sea, by the USS Finback, a lifeguard submarine.\n\nMore than seven decades later, vintage WWII-era planes, just like the one Bush used to fly, soared over the crowd of spectators as part of the Pearl Harbor commemoration at his library in College Station, Texas.\n\nA moment of silence was also held at 11:55 Central time, or 7:55am in Hawaii, the exact moment the attack on Pearl Harbor began.\n\nThe afternoon program included a panel, moderated by Brit Hume of Fox News.\n\nMore than 20 World War II veterans were among the distinguished guests in attendance at the Bush Presidential Library \u2013 including former Senator Bob Dole and Aaron Cook, the sole Pearl Harbor survivor in Wednesday's crowd.\n\n\"I don't really know how to describe it,\" Cook said.\n\nCook was just 19 at the time, and was working as a Chief Petty Officer in the US Navy, stationed on Ford Island. He remembers seeing the planes swoop in and unleash bombs.\n\n\"In retrospect, I'm glad I'm here. And I'm glad the country has survived,\" he explained.\n\nNow in his 90s, Cook said it's important to pay homage so that future generations can understand the significance of that day and a valuable piece of history simply isn't forgotten when he and his fellow troops are gone.\n\n\"People just don't seem to be responsive. Kids go to sleep when you're talking to classes and they don't even know what Pearl Harbor is. They just don't realize how important it is,\" he added.\n\nTo help educate and further inform the public about the significance of Pearl Harbor, a special exhibit has been set up at the President Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which will run through the end of this year.\n\n\"We began working on this about six months ago,\" said David Jones, CEO of the George Bush Presidential Library Foundation.\n\n\"Twenty-five years ago President Bush spoke at the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, as the sitting president, and we have a copy of the speech in our auditorium here on a continuous loop,\" Jones said.\n\nThere also is a digitally re-mastered version of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's famed speech for spectators to view, with the words of comfort he offered to stunned-Americans after the attacks.\n\n\n\nCasey Stegall joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 2007 and currently serves as a correspondent based in the Dallas bureau.

But there's more coming down the road.\n\nThe American Trucking Associations is pledging to come back next month, when Republicans will control the White House and Congress, and try to block state laws that require additional rest breaks for truckers beyond what federal rules require. The group says there should be one uniform national rule on work hours for interstate truckers.\n\nThe trucking industry's latest triumph has caused concern among safety advocates that it may signal the start of a broad rollback of transportation safety regulations once there's no longer a Democratic president to check the tendency of Republican lawmakers to side with industry.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it's going to be an open season on safety in this coming Congress,\" said Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board during the Clinton administration.\n\nShippers and some segments of the trucking industry probably will also push for long-sought goals of increasing the weight limit on trucks to more than 90,000 pounds and increasing the length of individual trailers in double-trailer combinations from 28 feet to 33 feet, safety advocates said.\n\n\"It's going to be very tough because the companies really care about the cost. They don't care about the safety no matter what they say,\" said safety advocate Joan Claybrook.\n\nThe provision Republicans added to a must-pass government spending bill this week suspends regulations issued by the Obama administration requiring truckers to take two nights off to rest after a work week of up to 75 hours.\n\nTruckers are required to take a 35-hour break after at the end of a work week. But the trucking industry objected to requirements that the 35 hours include two periods from 1 am to 5 am. Sleep scientists say rest during the early morning hours is critical for people to feel refreshed. The suspension means truckers can head out on the road again during those hours if the 35-hour break has elapsed.\n\nAnother regulation that prevents truckers from working 75 hours, followed by a 35-hour break, and then resume driving again in the same week was also suspended.\n\nTruck driver Bill Varnado, 66, of Dallas, Georgia, said he likes the sleep requirement because it ensures that drivers are well-rested. He said it's hard to find places to sleep in one's rig on the road, so drivers sometimes keep going.\n\n\"Sometimes you're forced to drive fatigued because you can't find anywhere to park,\" said Varnado, who drives for Pro Trucking Inc. of Acworth, Georgia, during a truck-stop break along Interstate 81 here.\n\nBut self-employed trucker George Lafferty, 61, of Henry, Illinois, said Congress should repeal the rule.\n\n\"I don't see how the government can tell you when to sleep and when not to,\" Lafferty said during a truck-stop interview along Interstate 81 after dropping off a load of yeast at a livestock-feed plant.\n\n\"A driver should know when he's fatigued or not,\" he said. \"If you're fatigued, take a half-hour, hour nap.\"\n\nBesides truck safety, Congress is also likely to be asked to deal with a wide range of other transportation safety concerns.\n\nThe auto and technology industries, for example, are telling Congress that they fear a \"patchwork\" of state safety laws will hinder the deployment of self-driving cars. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials have developed voluntary guidelines for the safe design, development, testing and deployment self-driving cars that they want automakers to follow. But California's Department of Motor Vehicles wants to make the guidelines mandatory.\n\nSome industry officials have complained the guidelines go too far and may stifle innovation. Safety advocates say they don't go far enough.\n\n\"We think it would be completely inappropriate for Congress to pre-empt the states without strong federal safety standards in place for automated vehicles,\" said William Wallace, a policy analyst for Consumers Union, the policy and mobilization arm of Consumer Reports.\n\n\"States are the ones that make the final call on whether automated vehicles should be allowed on the roads,\" he said. \"We think citizens of those states have the right to take action to keep their roads safe.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.533333361148834, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 660, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.56553740546, "HarmVirtue": 19, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.24242424242424, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/09/gop-wins-governors-races-in-vermont-missouri-indiana.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [100]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 746, "scraper_regex": 852}}, "headline": "GOP wins governors' races in Vermont, Missouri, Indiana; NC too close to call", "wordcount_as_scraped": 852, "date": "20161109060000", "story_content": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.  \u2013 \u00a0Republicans won control of governors' offices in Missouri, New Hampshire and Vermont on Tuesday, picking up a trio of previously Democratic seats in their quest to expand their statehouse leadership to their strongest levels in decades.\n\nThe governors' contests in a dozen states were part of a battle for statehouse supremacy that also included nearly 6,000 state legislative elections. Heading into Tuesday, Republicans controlled more than two-thirds of the nation's legislative chambers, as well as 31 of the 50 governors' offices.\n\nThey were inching toward their historical high of 34 governorships sent in 1922, with races in North Carolina and Montana still too close to call early Wednesday.\n\nIn a key legislative battle, Republicans also won control of the Kentucky House \u2014 the lone remaining Democratic-held chamber in the South \u2014 for the first time in nearly a century while defeating Democratic House Speaker Greg Stumbo. And Republicans reclaimed the Iowa Senate from Democrats, giving them control of both legislative chambers and the governor's office.\n\nThe states in play Tuesday included:\n\n___\n\nMISSOURI\n\nFormer Navy SEAL officer Eric Greitens defeated Democratic Attorney General Chris Koster in the state's costliest-ever gubernatorial race. He will succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon to become just the second Republican governor in the past 24 years.\n\nGreitens capitalized on his military service and his work as founder of the veterans' charity known as The Mission Continues. He cast himself as an outsider going up against a career politician. Koster, a former Republican state senator, had picked up key endorsements from the National Rifle Association and major agricultural groups.\n\nIncluding primary candidates, Missouri governors' campaigns raised more than $72 million, easily doubling the previous record.\n\n___\n\nVERMONT\n\nRepublican Lt. Gov. Phil Scott defeated Democrat Sue Minter to take over the office held by Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin, who chose not to run for another two-year term.\n\nScott is currently the only Republican statewide officeholder in a liberal-leaning state but has tacked to the left by embracing abortion rights and gay marriage and pledged to make government more efficient. Minter was a former transportation secretary for Shumlin.\n\n___\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nRepublican Chris Sununu defeated Democrat Colin Van Ostern in a close race set up by Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan's decision to forgo re-election in order to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte.\n\nSununu is the son of former Gov. John H. Sununu and the brother of former U.S. Sen. John E. Sununu. He has served on the governor's Executive Council with Van Ostern.\n\nDemocrats had controlled the governor's office for 18 of the past 20 years.\n\n___\n\nNORTH CAROLINA\n\nDemocratic Attorney General Roy Cooper claimed victory early Wednesday in a close race against Gov. Pat McCrory, but the Republican incumbent told his supporters \"the election is not over\" while citing uncounted votes and provisional ballots.\n\nCooper was ahead by just a few thousand votes out of more than 4.6 million counted.\n\nThe race has become a referendum on North Carolina's rightward shift under McCrory, highlighted by a law that limits anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and directs transgender people to use public restrooms matching the gender on their birth certificates. Cooper has vowed to try to repeal the law as governor.\n\n___\n\nINDIANA\n\nLt. Gov. Eric Holcomb won election over Democrat John Gregg to continue a 12-year run of Republican governors in Indiana. Holcomb, a former state Republican Party chairman, had had been appointed to the state's No. 2 spot by Gov. Mike Pence and later was nominated as his replacement when Pence dropped his re-election bid in July to run for vice president.\n\nGregg had tried to cast Holcomb as a \"rubber stamp\" for Pence, pointing out Holcomb's support for a religious-objections law that Pence signed. Opponents said the law, which was later revised, sanctioned discrimination against same-sex couples by allowing businesses to refuse to serve them.\n\n___\n\nWEST VIRGINIA\n\nJim Justice's victory will continue a 16-year stint of Democratic governors in a state that has otherwise been tilting toward Republicans. Justice, the state's wealthiest resident, cast himself as a political outsider adept at creating jobs.\n\nRepublican candidate Bill Cole, the state Senate president, had hoped to ride Trump's coattails. But Cole's pledge to revive the coal industry was offset by Justice, himself a coal billionaire.\n\nJustice will succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin.\n\n___\n\nMONTANA\n\nDemocratic Gov. Steve Bullock was in a close race against Republican Greg Gianforte, a computer software firm founder who poured millions of his own money into the race. Gianforte aired more TV ads than all other statewide executive candidates in the nation, according to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity of data from the tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG.\n\nBullock was heavily aided by the Democratic Governors Association.\n\n___\n\nOTHER STATES\n\nIn Delaware, Democratic U.S. Rep. John Carney Jr. was elected to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Jack Markell. And in North Dakota, Republican businessman Doug Burgum won election to replace Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple, who did not seek re-election. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert won re-election in Utah, and Democratic Govs. Kate Brown of Oregon and Jay Inslee of Washington also turned back challengers.\n\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.07270562648773, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 746, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.84299923111, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161109060000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.08310991957105, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/22/da-durst-danger-to-witnesses-despite-being-frail-in-jail.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [74]}}, "headline": "DA: Durst a danger to witnesses despite being frail, in jail", "wordcount_as_scraped": 704, "date": "20161222100000", "story_content": "LOS ANGELES \u2013 \u00a0Despite being held in custody, looking frail and getting rolled into court in a pink wheelchair, New York real estate heir Robert Durst is considered a danger to witnesses in the murder case against him, a prosecutor said.\n\nCiting his $100 million worth and allegations that Durst knocked off his best friend, who was a witness in the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Deputy District Attorney John Lewin said that he wants to record video of testimony in case witnesses die or are killed before trial.\n\nWitnesses are concerned about their safety, Lewin said Wednesday. He wants to preserve testimony from an unnamed witness \"who has very important information\" and Dr. Albert Kuperman, 85, who may have been the last person Kathleen Durst spoke with before her disappearance in New York.\n\nThe testimony would only be used at trial if the witnesses aren't available to testify.\n\n\"If Dr. Kuperman passes away,\" Lewin said, \"we can't go back later and figure out anything he would have said. ... There is one way and one way only for this to become an issue. ... The witness at the conditional examination would then have to disappear, die or be murdered.\"\n\nDefense lawyers objected to the suggestion that Durst, 73, posed a threat to anyone.\n\n\"That a man in a wheelchair is a threat to an 85-year-old doctor in New York,\" attorney David Chesnoff said, \"is just hyperbole.\"\n\nChesnoff also challenged Lewin's suggestion that Durst killed and dismembered a Galveston, Texas, neighbor in 2001 because he was also a witness. Durst, who had been hiding out in Texas disguised as a mute woman, was acquitted of murder after claiming he killed the man in self-defense.\n\nLewin replaced the facts of the case with his own interpretation, Chesnoff said.\n\nJudge Mark Windham set a Jan. 6 hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court to discuss the conditional testimony, though he tentatively set a Feb. 14 hearing for the testimony from the two witnesses.\n\nDurst has pleaded not guilty to one count of murder in the killing of Susan Berman just before Christmas in 2000.\n\nAt the time, she reportedly was planning to speak with investigators about his wife's suspected slaying. She had served as an unofficial spokeswoman for Durst, her close friend from college days.\n\nDurst was nabbed in New Orleans last year just before the final installment of a six-part documentary, \"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,\" aired on HBO.\n\nProsecutors said police moved in to arrest him because they feared he would flee after seeing the damning conclusion that ended with him walking off camera with a live microphone and muttering to himself: \"There it is. You're caught! What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\"\n\nIn the moments before he uttered those words, filmmakers had confronted Durst with a letter anonymously sent to police in 2000 tipping them to the location of Berman's \"cadaver\" that matched handwriting on a letter he had sent her years before. Both envelopes misspelled her Beverly Hills address as \"Beverley.\"\n\nDurst acknowledged in a nearly three-hour interrogation after his arrest with Lewin that he was in the process of fleeing when he was arrested. He was found in a hotel with a false Texas ID, more than $40,000 cash, bags of marijuana, a .38-caliber revolver, a map folded to show Louisiana and Cuba, and a flesh-toned latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair.\n\nThe defense objected to taking any testimony before they have been provided with evidence in the case and without enough advance notice of the names of conditional witnesses.\n\nProsecutors have said they might want to record conditional testimony from eight to 10 witnesses and won't provide their names until shortly before any hearing, Chesnoff said.\n\nThe defense attacked Lewin for publicly filing a transcript and audio of his lengthy interview with Durst, which they claimed was improperly conducted and violated their client's rights. That issue is likely to be the subject of future arguments over the admissibility of the statement.\n\n\"I'm not going to be spreading the evidence in the public record,\" defense attorney Dick DeGuerin said outside court. \"I'm very critical about that ... so we're not going to be guilty of the same thing.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.32356834411621, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 678, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.8272501129299998, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.3598820058997, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/21/iraq-ascendant-shiite-militias-take-fight-to-tal-afar.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [84]}}, "headline": "Iraq's ascendant Shiite militias take the fight to Tal Afar", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1196, "date": "20161121210000", "story_content": "TAL AFAR AIRPORT, Iraq \u2013 \u00a0A sandstorm is brewing west of the Iraqi city of Mosul, kicked up across a barren landscape by thousands of men and machines headed to war.\n\nTrucks, armored transports and even tanks carry fighters through a cloud of fine dust past a series of base camps and heavy weapons depots dotting the route to the front line against the so-called Islamic State.\n\nThese are the Shiite militias, and their goal is Tal Afar, on the main road to the Syrian city of Raqqa, the capital of IS' self-declared caliphate.\n\nCurrently a sideshow compared with the street-to-street fighting in Mosul, some 70 kilometers (44 miles) to the east, the battle for Tal Afar is certain to boost Shiite power. And its significance could be just as great \u2014 if not greater \u2014 for Iraq and the future of the region than the main battle for Mosul itself.\n\nOfficially, the Iraqi government and top militia leadership say that only Iraqi army units will enter Tal Afar, once dominated by Shiites but now primarily Sunni Turkmen, a minority in the country with cultural and historic links to nearby Turkey to the north.\n\nBut some of the militias' most powerful units, as well as field commanders and troops \u2014 all backed by a newly empowered Iran \u2014 tell a different story.\n\nJaafar al-Husseini, spokesman for Iraq's Hezbollah Brigades, said it is the militias backed by Shiite-heavy army units and Iranian weapons that will lead the charge into Tal Afar to drive out IS extremists.\n\n\"The Iranians are with us,\" he said, adding that Tehran was supporting the militias directly, including strategy from Revolutionary Guards commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who is in charge of a crescent of Shiite power stretching from Tehran to Beirut.\n\n\"Our mission and that of the (Iraqi Shiite) Badr Brigades is to encircle Tal Afar from the east. Then we will storm it,\" he said, adding that Soleimani visited a nearby staging ground three days ago.\n\nIraq's Shiite militias mobilized against IS in 2014. Since then, they have shown a growing determination to be a major force shaping the country.\n\nThe prospect worries Iraq's Sunni minority but also some officials in the military and the Shiite-led government, who fear the militias, bolstered by prestige from battles with IS, could one day dominate the country like the Revolutionary Guard does in Iran and the guerrilla group Hezbollah does in Lebanon.\n\nThe larger militias, like Asaib Ahl al-Haq, the Hezbollah Brigades, Badr and the Peace Brigades, emerged after the 2003 ouster of Saddam Hussein, and are linked to political parties. But their ranks surged after IS overran nearly a third of Iraq in 2014, and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's top Shiite cleric, called on able-bodied males to fight the militant group's Sunni extremists.\n\nThousands rallied to the militias late last month, bringing their strength to at least 15,000 men in the push toward Tal Afar to cut off IS supply lines west of Mosul. Their umbrella group, Hashd al-Shaabi, has agreed not to enter Mosul itself, but the same cannot be said of all groups when it comes to Tal Afar.\n\nOn the winding route through the desert, a relentless flow of pickup trucks and Humvees carried men bristling with weapons. The Iraqi flag was a rare sight; instead, most carried banners from various Shiite militias, with their distinctive font and iconography similar to that of Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Lebanon's Hezbollah.\n\nThe deployment has not gone unnoticed in the region.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that the militias could prompt a Turkish response if they \"terrorize\" the area's Iraqi-Turkmen. Ankara has deployed tanks and other vehicles to Silopi, a Turkish town on Iraq's northern border.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's official plan to have only the army enter Tal Afar played down the chance of an escalation, although the militias' actions may not.\n\nRights groups have accused the militias of abuses against civilians in other Sunni areas retaken from IS \u2014 allegations the militia leaders deny. Residents of Fallujah said Shiite groups exacted revenge during operations to retake the Sunni city last summer, alleging Sunni Arab civilians who fled IS-held areas were detained, tortured and killed.\n\nErdogan's ire probably was directed more toward Iran. The two countries' rivalry extends to northern Syria, where Iranian-backed militias fighting alongside Syrian forces are competing with Turkish-backed opposition forces for supremacy around the northern city of Aleppo.\n\nTurkey launched Operation Euphrates Shield in August, partly to drive back Islamic State militants from its borders. But the rebels it backed have advanced south, raising alarm among hundreds of Shiite militiamen from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon trying to seize opposition-held eastern Aleppo.\n\nOutside Tal Afar, the commander who led the operation to retake its airport last week said forces in the area would not stand for any Turkish intervention.\n\n\"We are Iraqis, and this is our country, and we consider any foreign intervention to be a provocation for us and our national sentiment,\" said Abu Taha Naser, \"and God willing, this will not happen if the Turkish leadership is wise.\"\n\nShould the militias take the city, it would cut a main IS artery into Syria, where the militants already face a recent offensive by a Syrian Kurdish-led force. That would be another major blow for the retreating militants and a boost for Syrian President Bashar Assad, an ally of Iran. Tal Afar would then be the last of a string of Shiite cities and towns stretching from Iran across Iraq toward the Syrian border.\n\nNo matter who leads the offensive into Tal Afar, the Shiite forces will inevitably hold the city because they \u2014 and not the Iraqi army \u2014 are in the area by the thousands, said Dana Jalal, a Kurdish specialist on Iraqi militias.\n\n\"Yes, they will enter Tal Afar, along with the Iraqi army's 92nd brigade,\" he said. \"It's actually more the will of the Iraqi army and less that of the government.\"\n\nIraqi officials still deny that the military will play a secondary role to the militias or leave it in their hands once Tal Afar is taken. But a look at the army unit intended to join the militias in the days ahead raises further doubt that Iraq's central government will be the main force in the fight for the city.\n\nThe 92nd brigade, nicknamed the \"Tal Afar Brigade,\" is made up almost entirely of Shiites from the city. But it also goes by another label: the \"Hussein Brigade\" \u2014 named for the revered Imam Hussein, the Prophet Muhammad's grandson and a key figure in Shiite Islam.\n\nFlags featuring the Iman Hussein were a common sight on vehicles racing through the desert, with militiamen exclaiming, \"On to Tal Afar!\" At a provisions depot farther behind the front line, militiamen ate sandwiches while listening to hymns chanting the imam's name.\n\nWith the thud of incoming mortar rounds from IS positions and ricochets from sniper fire as a backdrop, militiaman Taha Naser was clear.\n\n\"The priority is to cut the supply route between Tal Afar and Raqqa,\" he said, \"and then to liberate the city of Tal Afar.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Qassim Abdul-Zahra contributed from Erbil.\n\n___\n\nFollow Brian Rohan on Twitter at www.twitter.com/brian_rohan\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.5680932998657204, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1156, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.7059774665700003, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161121210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.50865051903114, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/05/mr-trump-have-unique-opportunity-to-defeat-islamism-as-muslim-im-ready-to-collaborate.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [251, 319, 861, 896, 933, 1198, 1290, 2043, 2425, 2541, 3088, 3104, 3190, 3250, 4091]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 925, "scraper_regex": 1032}}, "headline": "Mr. Trump, you have a unique opportunity to defeat Islamism.

Such statements are not only unhelpful but deliberately obfuscate the reality.\n\nIslamist attacks are very much related to Muslims \u2013 all Islamists are Muslims, even though most Muslims are not Islamists.\n\nIslamism comes from within Muslim communities, and, while a corruption of Islam, nonetheless relates to Islam proper from which Islamism steals and borrows. Without Islam there could be no Islamism. But without knowing Islam, one cannot unveil Islamism.\u00a0\n\nPresident-elect Trump provides a\u00a0serious, fresh opportunity to defeat\u00a0Islamism. As an observant Muslim devoted to combating Islamism, I welcome this opportunity and am ready to collaborate.\n\nWhy have we failed to dismantle Islamism, the ideology that delivered 9/11? Because we have been unable to examine and disable Islamism through\u00a0frank speech. Dismantling Islamism demands we distinguish Islam the religion, from Islamism\u00a0the totalitarian ideology.\n\nTrump's Commission on Radical Islam is the first step towards doing just that.\n\nOn Capitol Hill in 2012, I argued for exactly such an examination when I testified in the Fifith Investigative King Hearings.\n\nFive years on, the United States remains stymied in advancing understanding of Islamism restrained by President Obama's refusal to acknowledge Islamism. Claiming 'Islamophobia,' this refusal, championed by much of the American intellectual press through both Obama administrations, confines public discourse. Ironic, since refusing to acknowledge Islamism is the ultimate Islamophobic act.\n\nThis denial has had several negative effects:\n\nFirst, U.S. military and strategic thinkers are hindered in identifying threats\u00a0and planning efforts to counter both violent and nonviolent Islamism. Unable to discuss Islamism, they cannot engage insights from informed public intellectuals. Federal agencies were prevented from using words vital to such discourse.\n\nSecond, but far worse, Muslims like me \u2013 observing Islam but avowed combatants of Islamism- experience reverse Islamophobia: while our views are\u00a0marginalized on the basis of 'Islamophobia,' we are simultaneously denounced as Islamophobic by both the uninformed\u00a0and Islamist-sympathizing Muslims who seek our silence.\n\nThe net result? The space examining Islamism narrows stifling debate. Islamism wins. Further, because of the prevailing lack of understanding of Islamism, out of fear, the uninformed turn to loathing Muslims en masse and real anti-Muslim xenophobia ensues, even normalizes as France grapples with today.\n\nIt's time we reversed reverse Islamophobia.\n\nCertainly I decried NSA Advisor-designate Lt. General Mike Flynn's remarks about \"Islam being a cancer\" and \"Islam is a political ideology\"\u00a0(as I discussed\u00a0here). Yet reporting on these remarks (which I do consider xenophobic to Muslims) the\u00a0New York Times described him as an 'anti- Islamist' General\u00a0revealing its extraordinary confusion. If Flynn is a committed anti-Islamist (and not an Anti-Muslim xenophobe) we are in a great position!\n\nIslamism is the single most compelling threat to secular liberal democracy. Islamism is a political totalitarian ideology, a 20th century creation, which masquerades as Islam, a 1,400 year old monotheism.\n\nIslamism is both nonviolent and violent. Radical Islam is the violent component of Islamism. Nonviolent Islamism -- institutional Islamism -- seizes organs of democracy to shore power.\n\nViolent Islamism is merely a means to an end.\n\nMuslim political scientist Bassam Tibi delineates the six foundational tenets of Islamism. First \u2013 the relentless seeking of a new world order via imposition of a global transnational dictatorial 'caliphate.' 'Islam as Islamic state' and only as Islamic State \u00a0\u2013 'dawla' in Arabic, appears nowhere in the Koran, but was manufactured by the twentieth century founding fathers of Islamism.\n\nIslamism seeks its establishment within democracies. Islamists understand the potency of installation through popular vote. So they are very keen to stand in election-think Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood Party in Egypt post 2011 Arab Spring. Once Islamists attain power, they rush to seal the democratic causeway behind them.\n\nAll totalitarianisms need an external enemy. Islamism is no different. Hence a third tenet: Islamism holds Jews and global Jewry as chief enemy manifesting an anti-Semitism with religious overtones as central to its ideology, a startling departure from Islam which demands Muslims accept Moses as a Holy Prophet and the Torah as sacred.\n\nAchieving this aggressive re-ordering of world order requires Islamists pervert Islam's classical jihad into evolutionary terrorist jihadism.\n\nEvolutionary terrorist jihad renders not only as sanctioned but as sacrament the targeting of non- combatant civilians. This violence defiles a number of Islamic principles including the denouncement by Islam of the taking of any innocent life, the foundationally un-Islamic pursuit of any unjust war, and the defiling of God's creation -- both his Vice Regent in mankind and the earth itself.\n\nThe fifth tenet is Islamist 'sharia law' -- an invented version perverted to impose totalitarian rule without historical precedent. British scholar Sadakat Kadri identifies the Islamist appetite for 'pitiless punishment' \u2013 a form of justice lacking in Islam.\n\nFinally, Islamists are consumed with a craving for authenticity and purity - spending all their energies asserting theirs is the true Islam, and the rest of us, Muslim or not, are all imposters \u2013 in my case, as a believing Muslim who defies their Islamism \u2013 a treasonous heretic committing blasphemy worthy of death.\n\nThis is why Muslims like me, immersed in deep study of Islamism welcome the new Trump administration appetite to advance our nation's insights and interests by examining 'Radical Islam' \u2013 an enquiry that mirrors the interests of the wider Muslim world itself.\n\nAs a nation, we may come to the necessary realizations slowly and with difficulty because of the intensely inflammatory climate surrounding such debate -- one already triggering calls of 'McCarthyism', but if we remain silent, both Muslim and U.S. interests will suffer greatly.\n\nAnti- Islamist Muslims must lead the way and we are ready, Mr. Trump, to rise to the occasion.\n\n\n\nQanta A.

After a second hearing over his mental capacity, a judge has ruled that Roof cannot only now be sentenced for his crimes but can represent himself in those proceedings.\n\nThe same jury that last month took less than two hours to find Roof guilty of all 33 counts, including hate crimes and obstruction of religion, returns to court Wednesday to begin mulling if he should be sentenced to life in prison or receive the death penalty.\n\nHere's what has happened and what to expect.\n\n___\n\nLIFE OR DEATH\n\nProsecutors have said they might call as many as three dozen witnesses to make their case for why Roof, 22, should get the death penalty for the June 2015 slaughter at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.\n\nThe defense put up no witnesses during the seven-day trial. They repeatedly tried to work in evidence about Roof's mental state, but U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel ruled that had nothing to do with Roof's guilt or innocence.\n\nRoof has been adamant on representing himself during the sentencing phase of trial, with his defense team staying on as legal advisers. The capital defense experts who represented Roof during the guilt phase have said they fear he won't put up evidence that could potentially spare his life out of fear of embarrassing himself or his family.\n\n___\n\nROOF'S COMPETENCY\n\nRoof's whole trial was put on hold for several weeks so that Gergel could hold a first competency hearing. During that proceeding, which was closed to the public over media objections, Gergel heard two days of testimony, after which he determined Roof was mentally competent to face trial.\n\nAfter he was found guilty, a day before the scheduled start of the sentencing phase, Gergel held another hearing on Roof's mental status, saying serious enough issues had been raised in filings made under seal that he needed to address them in court.\n\nFor his part, Roof wrote in a journal read in court during his trial that he doesn't believe in psychology, which he called \"a Jewish invention\" that \"does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they don't.\"\n\nIn deeming him competent both to stand trial for sentencing and to represent himself, Gergel gave Roof an extra day to prepare his case. Jurors now will return to court Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nRACIAL HATRED\n\nProsecutors say Roof wanted to start a race war. His two-hour confession to the FBI seemed key to jurors' deliberation. One hour in, they asked to rehear the videotaped confession.\n\nRoof also documented his hate in his journal, found in his car when he was arrested.\n\nRoof believed segregation needed to return to keep white people from falling to the level of blacks. It had other bogus claims that whites were naturally the superior race and that blacks liked slavery.\n\nTestimony in the case opened and closed with two of the massacre's survivors.\n\nPolly Sheppard said Roof told her he wanted to leave her alive to tell the world why he attacked a historic African-American church.\n\n\"I have to. I have to,\" Sheppard recalled Roof telling her. \"You're raping our women and taking over the nation.\"\n\nHer 911 call was the final evidence jurors heard.\n\n___\n\nVICTIMS' PERSPECTIVES\n\nSome relatives of the nine shooting victims attracted copious amounts of attention for showing Roof mercy during his initial court appearance after his arrest, saying they'd pray for him. In the run-up to the federal death penalty trial, other victims' family members have said they favored the death penalty for Roof, sentiments echoed by some in media interviews after the guilty verdict.\n\nOthers, including shooting survivor Felicia Sanders, have been more coy, saying their preferences would become known during the sentencing proceedings. Many family members are expected to testify and give what are known as victim impact statements to the court, and, if he wants to do so, Roof himself would be asking them questions on cross-examination.\n\n___\n\nANOTHER TRIAL NEXT YEAR\n\nRoof faces a second death-penalty trial early this year in state court, where he's charged with nine counts of murder. A state judge is ordering 600 prospective jurors to report to the Charleston County Courthouse on Jan. 17 for initial screening. His order says the trial will begin on or after Jan. 30. It's not clear when the federal case will wrap up. For now, Roof has attorneys representing him in the state case.\n\n___\n\nKinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Younes said he has registered 1,600 families who fled Deir Hafer alone over the past few months.\n\nYounes said most of those displaced are women and children, adding that no one can leave without using smugglers who have good tribal connections and know what tracks to take through mined desert areas.\n\nThe extremist group has lost large areas it once controlled in Syria, as U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syria Democratic Forces and Turkey-backed Syrian rebels push ahead in separate offensives that have left hundreds of people dead on both sides. Turkish-backed rebels are now trying to capture the town of al-Bab, the largest IS-held town in Aleppo province.\n\nAssad has long portrayed the Syrian war as a choice between his rule and that of the extremists, and has maintained a veneer of normalcy in areas under his control throughout the war, now in its sixth year. While the country has been torn into several areas of control and opposition-held territory is pounded by airstrikes, areas controlled by the government have been largely spared the massive destruction and bombings.\n\nSaleh, who fled with her son Abdullah, decided to run away last year after her husband joined IS, a group that she says she hated because they mistreat women and are notorious for their public killings. She currently makes a living by making loofahs, which she and her relatives sell for 20 pounds (4 cents) a piece.\n\nSaleh first fled to her sister's house, shortly before the two began the journey along with other relatives that took weeks, staying for a few days at a time in one village after another so that IS fighters would not notice they were fleeing. Once they reached a front line between IS and other rebel groups, they paid the smugglers who took them to the rebel-held town of Azaz. From there, they drove to government-controlled territory.\n\nSaleh does not know where her husband is. When her son asks about his father, she tells him: \"He is in heaven.\"\n\nWearing a face veil that revealed only her eyes, she spoke about IS brutality \u2014 recalling one day when they shot seven men in the head and crucified them in the square of Deir Hafer for three days in order to scare the town's residents. The victims had been found guilty of raising Syrian flags on some buildings, Saleh said.\n\n\"I was shaken and ran away when I saw the swollen bodies,\" Saleh said.\n\nSamia al-Moussa wasn't so lucky. She fled IS-held territories last year but lost her husband to the extremists. On July 19, 2014, IS fighters knocked on her door in the town of Sheikh Ahmad and asked her husband, Abdul-Fattah, to go with them for some questioning. She never saw him again.\n\nThree months after taking him, IS fighters took Abdul-Fattah to the nearby village of Tel Maksour where they read the verdict accusing him of being a spy for the government. Al-Moussa, holding back tears, quoted witnesses as saying that her husband was beheaded in public.\n\nTwo years after the death of her husband, al-Moussa made it to Safira where she and her six children are staying with her brother-in-law, Nafeh.\n\nMother Agnes Mariam, a nun who assists the displaced, said that some 3,500 families have fled IS-held areas of Maskaneh, Deir Hafer and al-Bab in northern Syria over the past two months alone.\n\nFor Ziada Idlibi, 35, fleeing the northern town of al-Bab, currently under attack from Turkish, Russian and U.S. warplanes, was a journey filled with horror. Idlibi and her parents fled with the help of smugglers, but came under intense shelling as they tried to walk through mine-laced territory.\n\nThe shelling killed a girl and a boy and \"we almost got killed,\" she said.\n\nShe said she will only return to her hometown once it is liberated from the extremists who \"kill for nothing.\"\n\n\"Those people have no mercy in their hearts,\" said Idlibi as she carried her identity card, hoping to get assistance.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.65342617034912, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 884, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 16, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.59967659661, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170119080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.2986425339366505, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/28/trumps-immigrant-ban-part-long-sad-tradition.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [310, 507, 814, 951, 1089, 1256, 1377, 1428, 1740, 1975, 2088, 2206, 2207, 2208, 2437, 2749, 2998, 3305, 3411, 3530, 3777, 4028, 4413, 4564]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 667, "scraper_regex": 733}}, "headline": "Trump's immigrant ban part of a long, sad tradition", "wordcount_as_scraped": 733, "date": "20170129000000", "story_content": "For all of his anti-establishment rhetoric, President Trump's stance toward immigrants and Muslims is more of the same. Orientalism and Manifest Destiny have long animated American foreign policy and domestic treatment of its racial and religious minorities. \u00a0\n\nTrump's executive orders on Friday, effectively barring immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries, harks back to an era when holy wars were the currency for mass mobilization by the ruler.\u00a0\n\nIn the eleventh century, for example, Pope Urban II called on his people to defend the Byzantine Empire from encroaching Muslim armies. What became known as the First Crusade in European history books solidified the image of Muslims as fanatical followers of a false religion and a threat to Christendom.\u00a0Medieval romances and legends of battles between Christian and Muslim warriors nurtured the perception of a dangerous and violent Islam.\u00a0\n\nOver time, the stereotype of the Muslim savage animated the West's domination, restructuring, and deculturalization of the Middle East.\u00a0\n\nSo-called Middle East experts produced knowledge that situated the West as eternally superior to the East; and imagined the East as anti-democratic and uncivilized.\u00a0Islam was portrayed as backward and violent; thereby making Muslims savages who should be either converted or conquered.\u00a0 But its impact stretched beyond Europe's borders.\u00a0\n\nBritish colonists brought with them Orientalism, which coupled with the ideology of Manifest Destiny, was used to justify the conversion or termination of Native Americans, enslavement of Africans, and exploitation of the Chinese. As nonwhite and non-Christian, these groups were deemed biologically inferior.\u00a0 As such, it was the white man's burden to teach, civilize, and save them from their savage nature.\n\nOver time, the various offshoots of Orientalism animated our immigration policies in general and treatment of Muslims in particular. \u00a0The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was grounded in the Orientalist construction of the Buddhist Asian as heathen.\u00a0The Immigration Act of 1924 imposed a quota system with the intent to reduce immigration from non-European countries.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the number of immigrants from a country limited to two percent of people from that country in the U.S. in 1890 (thirty years before passage of the law), the percentage of immigrants from Western and Northern Europe soared.\u00a0 This explicit race-based immigration system purposely aimed to keep America predominantly white and Christian.\n\nWith passage of the Nationality Act of 1965, America effectively opened immigration from Asia, which included persons from Muslim majority countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia.\u00a0 Like the White Nativism that gripped America in the early 1900s after millions of Southern and Eastern Europeans (deemed inferior whites) immigrated to the United States, the increase in non-European immigration triggered a new wave of xenophobia.\u00a0 And just as the Chinese and Japanese had experienced in decades prior, post-1965 immigrants were collectively blamed for international crisis between their country of origin and the United States.\n\nThe oil crisis with Saudi Arabia in the 1970s triggered a wave of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim discrimination.\u00a0 The Iranian revolution triggered a wave of anti-Iranian discrimination by both the state and the public.\u00a0 The conflict between Palestinians and Israelis perpetuated tropes of the Palestinian terrorist in the American media.\u00a0 And most recently, the rise of transnational terrorist groups such Al Qaeda and ISIS have led to the collective punishment of Muslims in America through mass surveillance, selective anti-terrorism enforcement, and private acts of discrimination.\u00a0\n\nHarking back to the Crusades and European Orientalism, American policy makers now invoke terms like \"radical Islamic terrorism\" to reify the centuries-long trope of the Muslim savage and barbarian whose very existence threatens the Christian West. \u00a0That only a handful of Muslims in America, out of 6 million, have committed acts of terror is irrelevant because Orientalism is an ideology rooted in white supremacy and a clash of civilizations.\n\nSo when Trump signed his executive order allowing only Christian refugees and barring \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from America, he was no different than other U.S. presidents before him.\u00a0 His War on Terror is merely the latest version of Christian holy wars that use fear to manipulate the public into cowering to their ruler's mandates.\u00a0\n\nIn that regard, Trump's neo-Orientalism is the establishment.\n\n\n\nSahar F.

So did Thawee Sodsong, the officer who signed Sapae-ing's arrest warrant, meeting relatives in Pattani, the insurgency's epicenter.\n\nThe government's careful treading indicates how large Sapae-ing loomed in the imagination of southern Thailand, where a grinding insurgency has killed some 7,000 people since 2004. Several separatist groups are active in the three provinces closest to the Malaysian border, and Sapae-ing was associated with the most powerful, the Barisan Revolusi Nasional or BRN.\n\nMalay Muslims who make up the majority in of the three provinces have resented what they see as an imposition of Buddhist culture for decades. After a nationalist military junta seized power in 1932, Thailand passed the \"National Culture Act\" to press a uniform culture on the country. Lessons taught in local Jawi script were switched to Thai, and Muslim courts were replaced by civil courts, sparking resistance.\n\nSapae-ing was educated in local Islamic schools before departing for Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to study Islamic law in 1964. After his return, he swiftly established himself as a charismatic theologian with a potent authority. He became headmaster at Thamma Witthaya, a prominent Islamic school.\n\nHe \"was not only leader of his family, but was also the leader of a family of tens of thousands,\" the school said in a statement. \"He was not just headmaster of the school, but the headmaster of society in general.\"\n\nOver the 1960s and 70s, the rebellion was sporadic and fractured among dozens of separatist groups. Violence waned in the 1990s, as Thailand allowed limited cultural rights.\n\nIn the early 2000s, attacks escalated dramatically, led by the BRN. Sapae-ing was senior in the BRN but his official role in the organization is unclear.\n\nDon Pathan, a southern Thailand security analyst, said that although was little proof Sapae-ing was involved organizing day-to-day fighting, he served as a \"one-man religious police.\"\n\n\"It was enough to build a new generation of separatists,\" Don said.\n\nSapae-ing urged southerners to hold fast to their Malay Muslim identity and values while decrying the Thai government as a corrupting influence.\n\n\"He would go around the pubs and bars and look for his students, and if he'd see them he'd beat them,\" Don said. \"They look at the rest of the country and see that 'This isn't what we want for our kids.'\"\n\nThen-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra launched a bloody crackdown on separatists in 2004. Lawyers disappeared. Imams were shot. An army roundup on a single October day left 85 protesters dead; seven were shot to death and the rest suffocated in overcrowded trucks taking them away to be detained.\n\nPolice suspected Thamma Witthaya to be a \"hotbed of recruitment for the militants.\" Accusing Sapae-ing of spearheading the insurgency, police issued a warrant for his arrest, and he fled to Malaysia in 2004.\n\nDon said that although Sapae-ing said little publicly after leaving Thailand, he remained an influential figure in the south.\n\n\"He has moral authority, but he's not a politician,\" Don said. \"He's like a pope without a church.\"\n\nAfter a decade of violence, the Thai government reached out to Sapae-ing. Jaded, he balked but eventually sent representatives calling for greater autonomy instead of outright independence, a reconciliatory step that took insurgents by surprise. But he refused to meet Thai officials and talks went nowhere.\n\nSapae-ing died after suffering from stomach illnesses and complications from diabetes, said Srisompob Jitpiromsri, director of the independent monitoring group Deep South Watch, who has been in touch with Sapae-ing's relatives.\n\nHis death comes as new rounds of peace talks are underway. But the BRN has opted out and few think things will change.\n\n\"For now, they do not trust the military government,\" Srisompob said. \"It depends on the progress of the peace dialogues. Just wait and see.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.8510637283325195, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 656, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.42234774445, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170123090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.96341463414634, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/29/police-stymied-in-search-for-pennsylvania-twins-missing-10-years.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [78]}}, "headline": "Police stymied in search for Pennsylvania twins missing 10 years", "wordcount_as_scraped": 591, "date": "20170129180000", "story_content": "PITTSBURGH  \u2013 \u00a0Two weeks after child welfare workers removed four children from a woman's suburban Pittsburgh home in June for alleged neglect, they discovered an even bigger problem: The woman has two other children who are missing, and haven't been seen alive for more than a decade.\n\nSince the summer, police investigators have cast a wide net for twins Ivon and Inisha, who would be about 18 now. A county detective has testified he believes the children are dead but can't prove it. A cadaver-sniffing dog came up empty during a search of another Pittsburgh area house in December.\n\nPatricia Fowler was arrested in August on charges of concealing the whereabouts of her twins after police investigated following the removal of four of her other children. Fowler has claimed the children are safe and living out of state, but no information she's provided to police has panned out, authorities said. She's been free on bail.\n\nAs police try to solve the mystery, they have filed additional charges against Fowler, 47, accusing her of illegally collecting more than $50,000 in state food stamps, public assistance and medical benefits for the twins. As of Friday, she had not yet surrendered on the new counts, which include theft.\n\nA criminal complaint filed Wednesday said she had been collecting benefits for the twins since June 2011, and continued doing so through the end of August \u2014 weeks after police charged her with concealing the twins' whereabouts. Her public defender would not comment, citing an office policy to not commenting on pending investigations.\n\nFowler has changed her story several times regarding the whereabouts of Ivon and Inisha. She's told police the two children are living with friends or relatives in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, only to have the names and addresses she's provided not check out, or have relatives tell police they've never heard of the twins. Police said one out-of-state address provided by Fowler turned out to be a vacant storefront, and one Georgia city she named didn't exist.\n\nAt one point, Fowler even told police she sold the children years ago for $2,000 each to a woman she didn't know in a deal brokered by a man she met in a bar. She reversed course and told police that was a lie.\n\nPolice have unsuccessfully checked with the National Center of Missing and Exploited Children, which in September released age-progressed images showing what the twins may look like now. Other databases in various states provide no evidence that the twins ever attended school.\n\n\"In my professional opinion, I believe they've met their demise,\" lead Allegheny County detective Michael Kuma testified at Fowler's preliminary hearing on the concealment charges in October.\n\nThe detective said this week he can't comment on the ongoing investigation.\n\nFowler's son, Datwon, 19, remains jailed on charges he conspired with his mother to hide his twin siblings from authorities.\n\nDatwon texted police at his mother's behest back in August, pretending to be Ivon and saying that he and Inisha were safe and sound and living out of state, police said. But GPS tracked the phone to the home Datwon shares with his mother, and he confessed to the ruse.\n\nDatwon's attorney, Richard McCague, said he believes the new charges are an effort to put Fowler behind bars like her son.\n\n\"They don't have a complaint about child abuse and they don't have a body indicating someone has died. They believe these children are dead but they can't prove it,\" McCague said. \"Under those circumstances, what else can they charge mom with?\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.665629863739009, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 567, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.8272501129299998, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170129180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.82186948853616, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/27/five-border-security-priorities-for-trump-in-his-first-100-days.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [1603, 1821], "\u00a0": [5744]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 807, "scraper_regex": 896}}, "headline": "Five border security priorities for Trump in his first 100 days", "wordcount_as_scraped": 896, "date": "20161227180000", "story_content": "When President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of office in January, his administration will face a long list of immediate needs and challenges. Among them are a series of pressing issues for securing the border. Here are five priorities for the new Trump administration to address in its first 100 days.\n\n1. Build a Virtual Wall: While building a border wall was a hallmark of the President-elect's campaign, it will require complex construction and budget allocation that will take years to achieve. The challenges along the border cannot wait, particularly when there are technological solutions available now. The notion of a virtual wall, composed of cameras, sensors and other technologies, has existed for some time, but for a variety of reasons, progress has been insufficient. The new administration should review existing technologies, such as fiber optic sensors and robust communications capabilities, to support the Border Patrol's ongoing efforts to interdict illegal immigrants and illicit goods.\n\nThe administration also needs to speed up the timeline for implementing land port of entry (POE) entry/exit tracking technology. This has been a noted need for more than a decade, but even today, the United States has limited means to keep track of who is leaving the country across land POEs, which is essential for monitoring visa overstays. There are some pilot programs in the works, but more solutions are needed.\n\n2. Support Mexican Law Enforcement Training: In 2007, Congress appropriated nearly $2.5 billion for the M\u00e9rida Initiative, designed to help Mexico reform its criminal justice system and border security capabilities. As of November 2015, $1.5 billion had been spent in training, equipment and technical assistance, but the M\u00e9rida Initiative strategy is now focused on economic development and community-based social programs. While improving Mexican society may have broad benefits for dissuading illegal migration to the United States, American tax dollars need to be focused on enhancing the training and effectiveness of Mexico's control of its side of the border, as well as its southern border. To that end, the new administration should increase funding for training and equipment for Mexico state police and federal troops. This should be granted with clear metrics, plans for evaluation and audits of how funds are used. By this, the U.S. Border Patrol and state and local law enforcement can begin to realize the partnerships it needs to more effectively patrol and secure the border.\n\n3. Halt the Flow of Narcotics: There is an epidemic of heroin use growing across the country, and it is particularly prevalent among younger people. The amount of heroin produced in Mexico rose 67 percent in 2015, which is up 170 percent since 2013. Drug cartels are fostering a plague of addiction and overdoses, and the Trump administration needs to immediately give Border Patrol the tools necessary to target narcotics trafficking and arrest smugglers between POEs.\n\nAs a part of this, the administration should make it a priority to enhance Customs and Border Protection (CBP) cargo pre-screening on both sides of the border. Using data and rigorous screening before cargo reaches the border through expanded risk-segmentation, CBP can reduce the volume of unknown cargo and enhance their ability to target vehicles and shipments potentially smuggling narcotics, guns, cash or people.\n\n4. Enforce U.S. Law and Expedite Returns: The U.S. court system is already overwhelmed processing the status of people apprehended at the border. This is due in part to an increase in illegal arrivals from Central American countries. With adjudication sometimes lasting years, there is a perception that crossing the U.S. southern border is a ticket to living in the United States. The next administration needs to create an expedited legal process for returning illegal immigrants to their home country within one week of crossing the border. This will require increased funding to immigration courts to ensure fair but speedy processing and removal.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States needs to enforce its immigration laws, something that was insufficiently achieved during the Obama administration. This does not require a vast deportation force, as floated during the 2016 presidential race. Instead, by simply enforcing the laws on the books, the United States can begin to address the issue of millions of illegal immigrants.\n\n5. Work with the Private Sector: Border security is a multifaceted, highly complex endeavor. It is critical to choose the right leadership for government agencies involved in securing the southern border, and these leaders need to work hand-in-hand with the non-profit organizations and companies engaged on these issues on a daily basis. They hold insights and relationships that bring greater clarity and innovative solutions that can help the new administration select and implement technological infrastructure, empower border security agencies with the right tools, and cultivate cooperation with Mexican counterparts.\n\nWith a unified government, the new administration has enormous opportunity to make real progress in securing the border and addressing illegal immigration. But there's no time to waste. American voters made clear in the 2016 election that border security needs to be a priority for the country, and the Trump administration can answer that call by taking these common sense steps as soon as the 45th president takes office.\n\n\n\nNelson Balido is the managing principal at Balido and Associates, chairman of the Border Commerce and Security Council, and former member of the Homeland Security Advisory Council. \u00a0Follow him on Twitter: @nelsonbalido\n\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 6, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.12936341762543, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 807, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.5767846496199995, "HarmVirtue": 11, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.7087980173482, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/04/forgotten-women-who-are-supporting-trump.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [5033, 5756]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 910, "scraper_regex": 965}}, "headline": "The forgotten women who are supporting Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 965, "date": "20161104020000", "story_content": "Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in City Journal, a publication of the Manhattan Institute.\n\n\nOne of the strangest ironies of this strangest of campaigns is that, if America does elect its first woman president, it will be Donald Trump, not Hillary Rodham Clinton, who will have played the crucial role. As if to confirm the most fevered feminist images of predatory male sexuality, Trump has managed to offend some of the most loyal Republican women, from senators, to local organizers, to rank and file. He now lags about 20 points behind Clinton among women voters.\n\nBut while the media have been celebrating Republican women who finally \"get it,\" they have been less vocal about a striking class and education divide that should be a familiar theme in this election. Yes, college-educated women are overwhelmingly for Clinton; but women without college degrees are sticking with the Republican nominee. They may be less enthusiastic than they were in 2012, when they overwhelmingly supported Mitt Romney, and they are far less gung-ho than the almost two-thirds of their male counterparts in the Trump camp. Still, while the polls vary widely, Trump runs as high as 27 points ahead among white women without a college degree, higher than Clinton's 23-point advantage among college-educated women.\n\nSo why are less-educated white women willing to look past Trump's serial offenses? One preferred media explanation is that many of these women are evangelical Christians who remain wedded to traditional gender roles and feel anxious about women in powerful positions. \"Women who want to be protected in the private sphere or need to be protected in the private sphere tend to emphasize the need to protect and privilege women's special capacities for nurturing,\" the feminist historian Stephanie Coontz said in an interview in Vox.\n\nThe picture that emerges from on-the-ground reporting, including some of my own, clashes with this image of the timid Biblical \"help meet.\" Consider the most memorable character in J.D. Vance's bestselling memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy\": his grandmother, Mawmaw, a woman at ease with a rifle. Mawmaw was so disgusted by her husband's drinking that she doused him with gasoline and tossed a lit match. For good reason, her grandson took her seriously when she threatened to run over a classmate whom she believed was having a bad influence on him. (Amazingly, both men avoided serious injury.)\n\nNot that most of Trump's female supporters resemble Mawmaw. They work in insurance offices, hospitals, or schools, where they have to put on proper attire and say \"Pardon me\" without thinking when they bump into someone. Still, away from work, they are familiar with rural life and the coarser manners that sometimes go along with it. Their husbands or uncles may drive a truck; maybe their brother-in-law is a fireman or a plumber, men who come home muddy, greasy, and smelling more like an oil spill than Valentino Uomo. In her recent book \"Strangers in Their Own Land,\" the sociologist Arlie Hochschild profiles a single, 60-year-old Lake Charles, Louisiana accountant, a Pentecostal with \"a direct, forceful manner.\" \"I learned to handle a shotgun when I was six, picking off cottonmouth and copperhead snakes,\" she tells Hochschild. \"My daddy used to say if you shoot 'em, you clean 'em and eat 'em.\"\n\nAlmost all these women have male relatives or friends in the military; some of those men are serving in very dangerous places. Their devotion to these men motivates some of their bitterness toward elites whose men don't have to worry about IEDs and midnight visits from the military police. Their fears for the men's safety also explain much of their contempt for Hillary Clinton, whose infamous question from the Benghazi hearings\u2014\"What difference at this point does it make?\"\u2014was the verbal equivalent of a cottonmouth bite.\n\nNone of this means that Trump-supporting women approve of the candidate's wandering hands and foul mouth. But they take for granted a certain degree of bawdiness in relations between the sexes. \"When a group of women are together, we're talking just as nasty as the guys,\" a Trump-supporting teacher from Staten Island told me. \"We're all guilty.\"\n\nAt any rate, she continues, she doesn't get the gap between, on the one hand, empowered feminist talk\u2014the quasi-ironic embrace of terms like \"bitch\" and \"nasty woman\"\u2014and the reluctance to say anything when they're mistreated by a man, on the other. (Or when they say they were mistreated; a lot of Trump women are extremely skeptical.) \"All of these liberal women, I find it funny they're so outspoken fighting for women's rights and now they're afraid? It's all bullshit.\" Atlantic writer Molly Ball once asked Ivana Trump, Donald's first wife, whether it was \"painful\" to be \"treated like she was disposable, discarded abruptly after more than a decade of marriage for a younger woman?\" \"Ivana harrumphed . . . 'I am Eastern European woman. I am strong.'\" \u00a0\n\nThis language and worldview is a planet apart from our Trump-o-phobic media, professional, and political class, among whom I include myself. We were raised to \"use our words\" not gasoline cans and pick-up trucks. We work with men who sweat primarily when they go to the gym. We intuitively sense the line between playfully suggestive and inappropriate, a word that has become oddly resurgent in this era of the bourgeois f-bomb.\n\nTo understand this election, we should have spent much more time talking to women at ease with skinning a snake or having nightly dinner with a bone-tired man with calloused hands and few words. Had we done so, we might be less surprised by the results next Tuesday, whatever they might be.\u00a0\n\n\n\nKay S. Hymowitz is the William E.

A key tenet of the modern Western liberal consensus is to ignore the public's opinion in radically changing a country's demographics via mass immigration. In America and across Europe, politicians have slipped into a cozy consensus on opening borders and shipping in immigrants from often-dangerous and third-world countries.\n\nThe labeling of Wilders' views as \"hate speech\" in the first place is an effort to shut down debate. There is no distinction between free speech and the undefined \"hate speech,\" unless it directly tries to incite violence -- something Wilders did not do. Wilders' crime, like other politicians who have been outspoken on immigration, is to dare to raise the issue at all and to challenge the open borders, multiculturalist consensus. The Wilders prosecution is the latest in a concerning trend of trying to shut down the discussion altogether.\n\nThe authoritarians behind this prosecution hope that by doing so, it will stymie the debate, and feed their narrative that Wilders is not a man of the people, but a swivel-eyed racist. But actually it will do the opposite.\n\nThe court case actually plays right into two arguments of the same populist narrative that is sweeping through the West and knocking over Western leaders like dominos -- namely that a) your government cares more about protecting immigrants than protecting you, and b) Islamic immigration in particular threatens your democratic freedoms.\n\nFriday's verdict proves this isn't a right-wing conspiracy, but a reality. It will therefore give Wilders, as well as the populist right in Europe as a whole, a big shot in the arm.\n\nWe have seen this play out in the Netherlands before. Wilders became a more mainstream and popular figure after 2011, where he was put on trial -- and later acquitted -- for insulting the Koran and Islam, comparing the religion to fascism.\n\nThe Dutch have been particularly sensitive to the dangers Islam poses to free speech after filmmaker Theo Van Gogh was brutally murdered in the street in 2004 by an Islamist after daring to make a film criticising the religion of peace. Friday's case tells Dutch voters that the threat to their free speech is still real -- but that it is not just from Islam itself, but also from those running the country who care more about the rights of immigrants than of their own people.\n\nWilders' Party for Freedom is leading in the polls right now ahead of the elections scheduled for March. Their numbers have risen during the trial. Expect the Party for Freedom, and similar parties across Europe, to surge in popularity in the wake of this outrageous verdict.\n\n\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

Rivulets of water ran through the dirt, washing away chunks of ancient stone.\n\nThe city of Nimrud in northern Iraq is in pieces, victim of the Islamic State group's fervor to erase history. The remains of Its palaces and temples, once lined in brilliant reliefs of gods and kings, have been blown up. The statues of winged bulls that once guarded the site are hacked to bits. Its towering ziggurat, or step pyramid, has been bulldozed.\n\nThe militants' fanaticism devastated one of the Middle East's most important archaeological sites. But more than a month after the militants were driven out, Nimrud is still being ravaged, its treasures disappearing, imperiling any chance of eventually rebuilding it, an Associated Press team found after multiple visits in the past month.\n\nWith the government and military still absorbed in fighting the war against the Islamic State group in nearby Mosul, the wreckage of the Assyrian Empire's ancient capital lies unprotected and vulnerable to looters.\n\n\"When I heard about Nimrud, my heart wept before my eyes did,\" said Hiba Hazim Hamad, an archaeology professor in Mosul who often took her students there.\n\nIn three of the AP's four visits, its team wandered the ruins alone freely for up to an hour before anyone arrived. No one is assigned to guard the site, much less catalog the fragments.\n\nToppled stone slabs bearing a relief that the AP saw on one visit were gone when it returned.\n\nPerhaps the only vigilant guardian left is an Iraqi archaeologist, Layla Salih. She has visited multiple times, photographing the wreckage to document it and badgering militias to watch over it. Walking through the ruins on a rainy winter day, she pointed out things that were no longer in place.\n\nStill, Salih finds reasons for optimism.\n\n\"The good thing is the rubble is still in situ,\" she said. \"The site is restorable.\"\n\nTo an untrained eye, that's hard to imagine, seeing the destruction caused by the Islamic State group. Salih estimated 60 percent of the site was irrecoverable.\n\nThe site's palaces and temples were spread over 360 hectares (900 acres) on a dirt plateau on the edge of the Tigris River valley.\n\nA 140-foot-high ziggurat once arrested the gaze of anyone entering Nimrud. Now there is only lumpy earth. Archaeologists had never had a chance to explore the now-bulldozed structure.\n\nPast it, in the palace of King Ashurnasirpal II, walls are toppled into giant piles of bricks. The palace's courtyard is a field of cratered earth. Pieces of the two monumental winged bulls are piled nearby \u2014 their heads missing, likely taken to be sold.\n\nOff to the left are the flattened remains of the temple of Nabu, a god of writing. During a Dec. 14 UNESCO assessment tour, a U.N. demining expert peered at a hole leading to a seemingly intact tomb and warned that it could be rigged to explode.\n\nFrom 879-709 BC, Nimrud was the capital of the Assyrians, one the ancient world's earliest empires. In modern excavations, the site yielded a wealth of Mesopotamian art. In the tombs of queens were found troves of gold and jewelry. Hundreds of written tablets deepened knowledge about the ancient Mideast.\n\nTouring the site, UNESCO's representative to Iraq, Louise Haxthausen, called the destruction \"absolutely devastating.\"\n\n\"The most important thing right now is to ensure some basic protection,\" she said.\n\nBut the government has many priorities. It is still fighting IS in Mosul, and the list of reconstruction needs is long.\n\nTens of thousands of citizens live in camps. Much of the city of Ramadi is destroyed. More than 70 mass graves have been unearthed in IS territory. Other ancient sites remain under IS control.\n\nNone of the various armed groups around Nimrud \u2014 whether the military or various militias \u2014 has been dedicated to guarding it.\n\nDuring the UNESCO tour, Salih noticed that some of the ancient bricks from the rubble had been neatly piled up as if to be hauled away \u2014 perhaps, she suspects, to repair homes damaged in fighting. Stone tiles at the palace entrance vanished from where she saw them last.\n\nTwo locals were arrested with a marble tablet and stone seal from Nimrud, presumably to sell. The men are in custody.\n\nBut it's unclear where the artifacts seized from them are.\n\nThe police insisted they were at a lab in the northern city of Irbil. The lab said it knew nothing about them. The Antiquities Ministry in Baghdad said they were safe in the Nineveh government offices. An official there said they were with the police awaiting transit to Baghdad.\n\nThat circle of confusion makes theft easy.\n\nSalih is seeking international funding to pay someone to guard the site. But she recognizes the job will have to go to one of the militia factions, and she has no illusions they will provide full protection.\n\nShe'll have to cajole them into doing as much as they can.\n\n\"There isn't another choice, as you see,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press photographer Maya Alleruzzo and videographer Bram Janssen in Nimrud; and Salar Salim and Mohammed Nouman in Irbil, Iraq contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nRead previous reports in the AP's series \"A Savage Legacy\" chronicling the impact of the Islamic State group at: https://www.ap.org/explore/a-savage-legacy/\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.6958818435668905, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 847, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.8632755905500002, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 4, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161231120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9515938606847696, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/06/deadly-calls-domestic-disputes-among-most-dangerous-assignments-for-police.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4618]}}, "headline": "Deadly calls: domestic disputes among most dangerous assignments for police", "wordcount_as_scraped": 745, "date": "20170106230000", "story_content": "The killing of a rookie Pennsylvania state trooper one week ago was the latest resulting from one of the deadliest types of calls that police respond to \u2013 domestic disputes.\n\nOf the 64 firearms-related killings of police in 2016, domestic disputes topped the list of circumstances ending in an officer's death, according to a report by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF).\n\nSome 15 of the killings happened during the course of dealing with a domestic dispute, followed by \"suspicious person\" calls, during which 13 officers died, and attempted arrests, the NLEOMF report showed.\n\nThe killing of 23-year-old Landon Weaver last week followed a deadly domestic dispute call less than two weeks earlier, in Georgia, where two officers who were best friends died as they responded to a call in an apartment complex.\n\n\"They're emotionally-fueled incidents,\" said Lt. Randy Sutton, a retired Nevada police officer and author who is a spokesman for Blue Lives Matter. \"There's often alcohol or substance abuse involved, and it exacerbates the situation. Very often you can't talk someone down because they're so charged up with emotion.\"\n\nIn domestic calls, Sutton said, perpetrators have an advantage not duplicated in many other scenarios \u2013 they're on their turf, or familiar surroundings, in contrast to police officers responding to a call at the location.\n\n\"Someone's home can be a dangerous place to be for a police officer,\" Sutton said, \"they know where things are \u2013 guns, kitchen knives, a baseball bat, an iron.\"\n\n\"The police have to try to control the movement of the people in the home, and very often there are children there.\"\n\nWhen laws changed to mandate arrest in domestic violence, responding to such incidents grew more dangerous, Sutton said.\n\nIn California, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department is conducting an investigation into the killing of two officers in October who were responding to a domestic dispute call involving a man with a lengthy record and his parents.\n\nThe accused shooter, John Felix, has been charged in the murders of Officer Jose \"Gil\" Vega, a 35-year veteran of the Palm Springs Police Department who was set to retire at the end of 2016, and Officer Lesley Zerebny, who had just returned after giving birth to a daughter four months earlier. Zerebny had been with the department just 18 months. Vega was to have been off on that fateful day, but ended up working.\n\n\"So many times we get called to a domestic dispute and we wonder, 'What happened in this relationship that got so bad that police were called?'\" said Lieut. William Hutchinson, who oversees training and knew both Vega and Zerebny well.\n\n\"We get called into an already volatile situation,\" Hutchinson said, \"people are heated, it takes a while for them to calm down. The problem is that now you put in a third party, a stranger, the police officer, and we're the person who makes the final decision about what happens.\"\n\nOften, Hutchinson said, the person calling police for help does so as a way to threaten or give pause to the other person in the dispute, and takes exception when officers move to make an arrest.\n\n\"People get angry and they flip,\" he said.\n\nFelix was known to police, Hutchinson noted.\n\n\"He was a known gang member,\" he said.\n\nPublished reports said Felix had told his father shortly before Vega and Zerebny showed up that he wanted to kill police officers.\n\nRetired police officers Dave and Betsy Smith have made domestic dispute calls a key part of their law enforcement training seminars across the country.\n\n\nDave Smith, who was a police officer in Arizona, said: \"There's been an uptick in ambushes on police and often domestics are tied to that.\"\n\n\"A guy will kill Mama and the kids, and then wait for cops\" to shoot at them, Smith said.\n\nThe deaths of Vega and Zerebny continue to gnaw at those in the Palm Springs Police Department.\n\n\"It's one of those situations that forever changes your department,\" Hutchinson said. \"Everybody there has probably had the conversation with their spouse quitting. You wonder 'Why do we keep doing this job?'\"\n\nHutchinson said that after the investigation into the shooting is concluded, the department likely will examine what changes need to be made in terms of training and procedures when responding to domestic disputes.\n\n\"We'll look at what went wrong, what went right,\" he said.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Llorente is Senior Reporter for FoxNews.com, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnews.com.

And last year, Obama took Cuba off America's state-sponsored terror list, amid criticism about continuing human rights violations on the island nation.\n\n\"Every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba's favor,\" Trump said during this year's GOP presidential primary debates.\n\nFlorida GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen -- who was born in Havana in 1952 and whose family eight years later fled Castro's regime -- told Fox News on Saturday that Trump criticized Obama's 2014 deal because the U.S. made concessions \"in exchange for nothing,\" including Cuba releasing no American political prisoners.\n\nRos-Lehtinen's congressional district includes Miami, where for decades Cubans have come to live.\n\nBut whether the Cuba agreement made by Obama through executive order, or whether Castro's death improves the potential to improve the two countries' relationship, remains unclear.\n\nFlorida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, whose parents emigrated from Cuba before Castro's rise in 1959, said on Fox News that the ex-dictator's death was a newsworthy event but that he \"didn't think it would change anything,\" or at least while Raul Castro remains in power.\n\nRubio, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate and potential 2020 contender, also argued that Obama attending Castro's funeral or sending a top-level administration official would validate the life of somebody who oversaw the \"assassination of Americans.\"\n\nTexas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, whose father was born in Cuba, said: \"Fidel Castro's death cannot bring back his thousands of victims, nor can it bring comfort to their families.\"\n\n\"Today we remember them and honor the brave souls who fought the lonely fight against the brutal communist dictatorship he imposed on Cuba,\" continued Cruz, also a 2016 GOP presidential candidate.\n\nTrump was among the first Washington leaders to react to the announcement of Castro's death, exclaiming on Twitter: \"Fidel Castro is dead!\"\n\nVice President-elect Mike Pence tweeted: \"The tyrant #Castro is dead.

Kennedy. One day before the inauguration, Eisenhower's mind was on the looming threats to American security, and Cuba was high on that list.\n\nWriting about this critical moment in U.S.-Cuban relations in my new book, \"Three Days in January: Dwight Eisenhower's Final Mission\" (out from William Morrow on January 10, 2017), I was struck by the parallels between then and now, especially as we grapple with the implications of the death of Fidel Castro. \u00a0\n\nThen, at the height of the Cold War, the threat posed by a Soviet-backed dictator off our southern coast was grave, and the need to formulate the right response in a nuclear age was a grave concern for Eisenhower. \u00a0\n\nOn the campaign trail during the 1960 presidential election, Kennedy had been bullish about dealing with and confronting Castro. Now Ike wanted to give him a more measured perspective.\n\nIn a cabinet meeting following their private discussion, Kennedy learned the details of a plan in development under the auspices of the CIA to train Cuban exiles for a potential invasion of Cuba. \u00a0The aim was to overthrow Castro's brutal regime. But, Ike stressed, the plan was only in the early stages, and certain conditions would have to occur if it had any chance of success\u2014including the creation of a government in exile and a strong leader who was capable of replacing Castro. Kennedy listened respectfully, but he mostly ignored Ike's caveats. \u00a0Kennedy was impatient with the process Ike favored, which involved extensive debates from national security advisers. \u00a0He preferred a looser, more shoot-from-the-hip style, and relied on a couple of key men who had his ear. \u00a0In the case of Cuba, the absence of sound advice had disastrous consequences.\n\nWithin three months of becoming president, Kennedy approved a poorly planned invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs by a disorganized group of exiles. When he withdrew critical air support, Castro's forces easily swept in and killed or captured the exiles. It was a complete failure\u2014and Kennedy knew it. \"How could I have been so stupid?\" he raged.\n\nIn desperation he turned to Eisenhower. \u00a0On April 22 he sent a helicopter to bring Ike from his home in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania for a private consult at Camp David. \u00a0As the two men strolled along the wooded paths, Kennedy lamented, \"No one knows how tough this job is until he's been in it a few months.\"\n\nEisenhower smiled wryly. \"Mr. President,\" he replied softly, \"if you will forgive me, I think I mentioned that to you three months ago.\" And indeed he had. But Kennedy, bursting with confidence, hadn't taken him seriously.\n\nKennedy's Bay of Pigs fiasco unleashed the rage of Castro and emboldened the Soviet Union to begin erecting missile sites in Cuba pointed at the United States. The Cuban Missile Crisis, over half a century ago, remains America's most chilling encounter with an immediate nuclear threat. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOnce again, Kennedy turned to Ike. In a tape recording of their conversation on file at the JFK Library, one can hear the nervous uncertainty in Kennedy's voice\u2014and the unruffled calm in Eisenhower's. Kennedy knew he had to act, even if it meant attacking Cuba and removing the missile sites by force. But he was worried about making a fatal mistake. \"What about if the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, announces tomorrow, which I think he will, that if we attack Cuba, that it's going to be nuclear war, and what's your judgment as to the chances they'll fire these things off if we invade Cuba?\" he asked Eisenhower.\n\nIke, the old warrior who had stared down Hitler as commander of the allied forces in World War II, saw through the bluster of our enemies. \"Something may make these people shoot 'em off,\" he said. \"I just don't believe this will.\"\u00a0 Reassured, Kennedy went on to negotiate the removal of the missile sites, and did it without having to attack Cuba. But it was a very close call.\n\nToday, the wounds from the conflicts of the early 1960's remain exposed and painful. When President Obama opened relations with Cuba in May of this year, six in ten Americans supported normalization. But for many others, especially in South Florida, the atrocities of Castro's regime cannot so easily be forgotten, and its future commitment to freedom for its people is not so clear.\n\nIn conversations during the transition, Eisenhower told Kennedy that the easy decisions a president faces are handled by staff. \u00a0Only the impossible ones fall on the president himself. \u00a0\n\nPresident-elect Trump will likely find that to be true as well, and Cuba is a good example. As president he will oversee the beginning of the post-Fidel Castro era, with all the complexity that entails. The decisions he makes early in his term could shape our relationship with the island nation for decades to come. He has already signaled his intention to renegotiate President Obama's deal and perhaps even terminate it, but no matter what his strategy it will have significant consequences.\n\nIf Eisenhower were advising President-elect Trump today, he would likely suggest, as he did with Kennedy, that the best way to approach such a complex matter was to proceed cautiously, to hold his cards close to his vest, and to strategize in private.\n\nIn particular, Ike would have advised bringing voices from all sides into the room--those who agreed with the president and those who did not--and letting them engage in a rigorous debate.\n\nWe don't know what could have changed if President Kennedy had listened to Ike's same advice at the time.\n\nMore than five decades later, without the looming Soviet nuclear threat, a President Trump has an opportunity to steer a new course in U.S. Cuba relations.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTuesday, the Obama administration sent Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes and U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis to attend a memorial service for Fidel Castro in Havana.\u00a0\u00a0 The administration insisted it was not \"honoring\" the dictator, who executed thousands of Cuban citizens and persecuted many more, because they didn't send \"an official delegation\" to the ceremony.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters about the move, \"We believe that this was an appropriate way for the United States to show our commitment to an ongoing future-oriented relationship with the Cuban people.\"\n\nNo matter which path the 45th president chooses when it comes to Cuba, one can be assured, it will be different in some way to the path the 44th president has pursued.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\nBret Baier is the Chief Political Anchor of Fox News Channel, and the Anchor & Executive Editor of \"Special Report with Bret Baier.\"\u00a0 His book, \"Three Days in January: Dwight Eisenhower's Final Mission,\" (William Morrow) is on sale now. \u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.72960376739502, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1123, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.9541957835000003, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161130180000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.9590382902938601, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/04/7-weird-things-that-happen-when-youre-breast-feeding.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3606, 4921, 5139]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 767, "scraper_regex": 830}}, "headline": "7 weird things that happen when you're breast-feeding", "wordcount_as_scraped": 830, "date": "20161204130000", "story_content": "Alongside pregnancy and childbirth, breast-feeding is one of the most normal, natural things your body is capable of. If you're a new mom, you know breast-feeding is healthy for both you and your baby, but what you may not know is there are some strange\u2014 even shocking\u2014 things that can happen when you breast-feed.\n\n1. Breasts \"eat\" themselves.\n When you stop breast-feeding, your body will go through involution, a process by which the cells in the breasts that make milk deteriorate and self absorb because they're no longer needed, said Diana West, an internationally board-certified lactation consultant and director of media relations for La Leche League, a non-profit focused on breast-feeding, in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nResearchers say a protein called Rac1, which aids milk production, is also what's necessary for removing dead cells and milk when breast-feeding ends, according to a recent study in the journal Developmental Cell.\n\nSome of the fat in the breasts can also be reabsorbed, which is a result of metabolism and weight loss because of the excess calories that you need to feed your baby, West said.\n\n2. Breasts can leak or spray during sex.\n When oxytocin, also known as the love hormone, is released from the pituitary gland, it allows for milk to \"let down\" from your breasts.\n\nLetdown will happen when your baby latches on, but it can also happen when you look at his picture, hear him cry or even hear another baby cry because it's a primal response to soothe your child, said Tipper Gallagher, an international board certified lactation consultant in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesonta and founder of theboobgeek.com.\n\nNot only that but after you get the green light to be intimate again, your breasts might leak or spray when you have an orgasm.\n\n\"Oxytocin is released anytime you do something pleasurable,\" Gallagher said.\n\n3. You might experience a mix of emotions. \nBecause of the oxytocin that's released, you'll probably feel happy when you breast-feed. Yet some moms say they also experience intense thirst, a feeling of protectiveness and deep bonding.\n\nAlthough it's rare and not something you're likely to talk about with your friends, there's another feeling you could experience as a result of your hormones.\n\n\"Just like orgasm can cause milk letdown, milk letdown can give you feelings of pleasure\u2014 sexual pleasure,\" Gallagher said.\n\nSome moms may have a moment of anxiety, while for others it can last for 20 minutes. These moms have a condition known as Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex (D-Mer), which is a physiological experience\u2014 not a psychological one\u2014 that's related to inappropriate dopamine levels.\n\n\"A person feels overwhelming anxiety and irritability like their skin is crawling and restlessness\u2014 they just want to run away,\" West said. If you think you have D-Mer, speak to your physician or a lactation consultant about treatment options.\n\n4. The contractions aren't over.\nWithin the first two weeks after you give birth, you may have period-like cramps while you breast-feed. This is your body's way to stimulate contractions so that your uterus can return to its pre-pregnancy size.\n\n5. Breasts can get hard like rocks.\n It's something you can't believe until you experience it yourself but your breasts can get so big and hard, they look like balloons ready to explode.\n\nEngorgement is normal in the first few days after you give birth, or if you haven't completely emptied them. The good news is that once you start feeding your baby regularly and emptying your breasts, they'll feel normal again. \u00a0\n\n6. You might be modest, embarrassed or totally comfortable.\n Breast-feeding for the first time\u2014 and the lack of modesty required\u2014 can take you by surprise, especially when the nurses or lactation consultants get up close and personal to help you.\n\nWhen it comes to breast-feeding in front of other people you might feel completely comfortable or more modest.\n\nIn fact, six out of 10 breast-feeding moms try to hide breast-feeding in public and a third feel embarrassed or uncomfortable doing it away from home, according to a survey out of the U.K.\n\n7. Breast-feeding is possible after breast surgery\nIf you had breast augmentation surgery, the good news is that you'll probably be able to breast-feed. In fact, a recent study presented at the International Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery conference found that 94 percent of babies born to mothers who had surgery were able to nurse.\n\nLikewise, if you had breast reduction surgery and your nipples were completely severed, chances are you can still breast-feed because the milk ducts can either re-grow or re-connect.\n\n\"They don't necessarily have full milk supplies because not all the ducts have re-connected, but quite a few women surprisingly are able to get some milk out,\" West said. \"That to me is such a testament to how resilient our bodies are.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\nJulie Revelant is a health journalist and a consultant who provides content marketing and copywriting services for the healthcare industry.

Especially from women who want to quit smoking during pregnancy, or who smoked in the past and may want to try e-cigarettes as a way to get the nicotine fix they still crave.\n\nBut before we hit on e-cigarettes, let's recall some facts about the dangers of smoking.\n\nWhen you see a commercial about the need to quit cigarettes, what do you usually see? A person who has been severely disfigured as a result of their smoking \u2013 someone who has lost limbs or undergone open heart surgery. Or a person left disfigured by operations to save them from throat or mouth cancer. At the end of the commercial, you see a graphic that says, \"Smoking causes immediate damage to your body.\"\n\nAnd not only does smoking cause immediate damage \u2013 but it also causes long-term damage to your blood vessels, which can last for years after you quit.\n\nNow, what can smoking do to a pregnancy? The risk factors for infants born to mothers who smoke can include low birth weight and learning disabilities. Smoking also carries the risk of miscarriage, preterm labor and even stillbirth.\n\nHow does smoking lead to all of these atrocities? Nicotine and other chemicals found in cigarettes have numerous negative effects on the small blood vessels of the placenta. The placenta is the organ responsible for bringing oxygen and nutrients from the mother to the baby during pregnancy \u2013 think of it as the baby's lungs and lifeline in the womb.\n\nWhen that tissue is exposed to toxins like nicotine, damage can be done \u2013 no matter how many cigarettes you smoked, or when you smoked them. Many patients tell me they decided to quit smoking once they confirmed their pregnancy. But nicotine still lingers in the body for one to four days after quitting, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nMany journals have documented the effects of nicotine on the placenta. In 2002, \u00a0the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published a very important paper revealing the ill effects that smoking can have on the blood vessels and tissue of the placenta. And as far back as 1996, the American Journal of Epidemiology, in a very large study, demonstrated statistical evidence indicating that placentas of smokers had lesions characteristic of poor blood flow, which consequently had negative effects on newborns.\n\nThese effects on newborns can be cumulative, and are very difficult to prevent. In severe cases, the damage to placental function can be so acute that it can lead to premature separation of the placenta, which may cause perinatal complications. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) continues to grant millions of dollars in research to scientists trying to better understand the function of the placenta and how toxins, such as cigarette smoke, could lead to its dysfunction.\n\nNow, back to the question I get from patients every day: Are e-cigarettes safe?\n\nThe overwhelming answer is: No, they are not safe.\n\nE-cigarettes still expose your unborn child to nicotine, which we know is one of the main toxins implicated in placental damage. Furthermore, there are currently no regulations on e-cigarettes. In other words, many of the devices being sold containing liquid nicotine are very poorly controlled, and as a result, you might be exposing your unborn child to a much higher dose of nicotine than you would even find in a typical cigarette. Since you may think that e-cigarettes are safe, you may be doing this repeatedly.\n\nHere's the best advice I can give you: Never pick up smoking to begin with, because it takes a while for the chronic effects of cigarette smoking to go away. And if you already smoke, quit. Don't replace cigarettes with e-cigarettes, especially during your pregnancy.\n\n\n\nDr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor.

Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, says she wants to evaluate whether President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general can enforce laws that he voted against.\n\nIn her opening statement at the confirmation hearing for Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Feinstein said \"there is so much fear in this country,\" particularly among African Americans. She noted Sessions has in the past voted against hate-crimes legislation.\n\nShe said the role of attorney general is \"an awesome responsibility\" and said his job will be to enforce the laws, rather than to advocate his beliefs.\n\nShe noted that Trump said during the campaign that he would direct the attorney general to investigate his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"That's not what an attorney general does,\" Feinstein said.\n\n___\n\n10:05 a.m.\n\nOpening two days of hearings on President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley says fellow Sen. Jeff Sessions \"is a man of honor and integrity, dedicated to the faithful and fair enforcement of the law.\"\n\nSessions is a member of the Judiciary panel. Democrats on the committee have expressed concerns about whether the Alabama Republican can be non-political in his role as the nation's top law enforcement officer.\n\nGrassley says Sessions is a man \"who knows well and deeply respects\" the role of the Department of Justice. He noted that Sessions questioned previous attorney general nominees on whether they could be independent.\n\nLike Sessions has previously, Grassley criticized the Obama administration for not enforcing some criminal and immigration laws.\n\n___\n\n9:35 a.m.\n\nTwo men wearing Ku Klux Klan costumes were removed from the confirmation hearing for Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, after they caused a disruption.\n\nAs security took them out of the room, they yelled, \"you can't arrest me, I am white!\" and \"white people own this government!\"\n\nCivil liberties advocates have cited Sessions' voting record and his appearances before groups that espouse harsh views on Muslims and immigrants.

But he said he would defer to the views of his defense secretary, James Mattis, who has questioned the effectiveness of such practices as waterboarding, which simulates drowning.\n\n\"He has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it -- \u00a0enhanced interrogation I guess would be a word that a lot of ... words that a lot of people would like to use. I don't necessarily agree. But I would tell you that he will override because I'm giving him that power. He's an expert,\" Trump said. He called Mattis a \"general's general,\" whom he would rely upon.\n\n\"I happen to feel that it does work. I've been open about that for a long period of time. But I am going with our leaders. And we're going to win with or without. But I do disagree.\"\n\nThe focus on torture has been renewed since The Associated Press and other news organizations obtained a copy of a draft executive order that signals sweeping changes to U.S. interrogation and detention policy.\n\nThe draft order, which the White House said was not official, also would reverse President Barack Obama's effort to close the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- a place Trump has said he wants to fill up \"with bad dudes.\"\n\nThe draft orders up recommendations on whether the U.S. should reopen CIA detention facilities outside the United States. Critics said the clandestine sites have marred America's image on the world stage.\n\nTrump also spoke of his hour-long phone call with Pena Nieto earlier in the day. He described it as a \"friendly call\" a day after the Mexican leader canceled his visit to Washington after Trump moved forward on his campaign promise to build a border wall.\n\nTrump reiterated his stance that the US-Mexico border is porous and drugs are making their way into the U.S.\n\nHe also vowed to renegotiate American trade deals with Mexico.\n\nFollowing the cancellation, Trump's spokesman said the White House would seek to pay for the border wall by slapping a 20 percent tax on all imports from Mexico, as well as on other countries the U.S. has a trade deficit with. The White House later cast the proposal as just one option to pay for the wall.\n\nThe strong reaction from Mexico signaled a remarkable souring of relations between Washington and one of its most important international partners just days into the new administration. The U.S. and Mexico conduct some $1.6 billion a day in cross-border trade, and cooperate on everything from migration to drug enforcement to major environmental issues.\n\nLater in the day, the president was to travel to the Pentagon, where he was expected to sign a trio of executive actions, including one to halve the flow of refugees into the United Sates and stop all entries from some majority-Muslim nations.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump also intended to sign actions related to military readiness and the National Security Council. Details of those directives were not immediately clear.\n\nAccording to a draft of the refugee order obtained by The Associated Press, Trump would move to indefinitely stop accepting Syrian refugees. The order also calls for a pause in the nation's broader refugee program for at least 120 days.\n\nTrump campaigned on a pledge to put in place \"extreme vetting\" procedures particularly for people coming to the U.S. from countries with terrorism ties. According to the draft order, the president plans to suspend issuing visas for people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 30 days.\n\nWhile at the Pentagon, Trump was expected to meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and attend a ceremonial swearing-in for Defense Secretary James Mattis.\n\nTrump has the authority to determine how many refugees are accepted annually, and he can suspend the program at any time. Refugee processing was suspended in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and restarted months later.\n\nDuring the past budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Barack Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000.\n\nTrump, according to the impending executive order, plans to cut that by more half to 50,000. The draft order says that while the program is suspended, the U.S. may admit people on a case-by-case basis \"when in the national interest\" and the government will continue to process refugee requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion ... is a minority religion in the individual's country.\" That suggests it would allow the admission of Christians from Muslim-majority countries.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.7678208351135294, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 891, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.11809151015, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170127200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.25476992143659, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2016/12/07/how-do-know-if-concert-venue-is-safe.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [57, 604, 1260, 2888, 3278, 4590]}}, "headline": "How do you know if a concert venue is safe?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 793, "date": "20161207140000", "story_content": "LOS ANGELES \u2013 \u00a0The deaths of at least 36 concertgoers in an Oakland warehouse inferno last Friday have many wondering if there is any way to know if a concert venue \u2013 especially a non-traditional space -- is safe.\n\nPaul Wertheimer, head of Los Angeles' Crowd Management Strategies, said no one can ever really know for sure.\n\n\"We assume venues are safe,\" Wertheimer told FOX411. \"We find out too late they are not\u2026 There are too often few and fleeting options of escape. Getting on your knees and heading for the exit -- if there is one visible and unlocked -- \u00a0is good advice for the first 10 people. After that, survivability diminishes.\"\n\nOfficials said the Ghost Ship Warehouse had no fire sprinklers or smoke detectors and the only way out was on the first floor through a dark, rickety stairway.\n\nWertheimer said concerts like the one at the Ghost Ship are illegal and leave no room for safety.\n\n\"They are not safe in any way,\" he said. \"Unsafe venue, no crowd management plan, no emergency plan, no trained crowd managers, no capacity limitation.\"\n\nSteve Adelman, Vice President of the Event Safety Alliance, said people need to be as aware as they possibly can when they go to any sort of entertainment space.\u00a0\n\n\"The thing that people should look for when they go into any live event space \u2026 is clearly marked exits over a door which is accessible to them,\" he explained. \"Anybody at this point knows what an exit sign is supposed to look like\u2026that is not a hard thing to ask people to look for. That exit sign has to be over a door which is accessible to them.\"\n\nBut most people do not necessarily asses the risks a venue might have before going, and evacuation plans are not something that crosses their mind until there is an emergency.\n\n\"The whole idea of going to a show, a club, or sporting event it's a place where other people have already taken care of safety measures,\" Adelman said. \"I think most of the time when someone goes out for entertainment purposes, they are kind of suspending their disbelief about the need to protect themselves because they trust someone already looked into this.\"\n\nThe Ghost Ship warehouse manager Derick Ion Almena apologized for the tragedy on \"Today\" Tuesday morning.\n\n\"It's not a good morning. What am I doing here? Can I just say I'm sorry?\" he said. \"The only reason why I'm here is to put my face and my body here in front. Am I the man who should be held accountable? Did I build something \u2026 I mean what am I going to say to that? Should I be held accountable? I can barely stand here right now.\"\n\nWertheimer said the real problem is deficiencies in crowd safety laws.\n\n\"The scandal is a lack of comprehensive crowd safety laws and the failure of public officials to enforce those that exist,\" he said. \"The other problem is compliance...The first responders did a heroic job in Oakland. \u00a0But, what about the fire inspectors, police and city that could have prevented---or attempted to prevent this known illegal situation?\"\n\nEarlier this week, the Los Angeles County Fire Department issued tips for what you should do before enterting an entertainment venue.\n\n1. Take a good look around at the condition of the building.\n\n2. Have a communication plan and plan a meeting place. \u00a0\n\n3. When you enter the building locate exits immediately and check for clear exit paths.\n\n4. If there is an emergency, react immediately, get out and stay out.\n\nA refrigerator may have been the cause of the Oakland warehouse inferno. Alameda County Sheriff Greg Ahern said a person who escaped the deadly blaze told authorities there were flames coming from the refrigerator, and evidence found at the scene so far supports the claim.\n\nThe building's structure and safety have reportedly been on city officials' radar for some time and questions have emerged about whether more could have been done to prevent the fire.\n\nOakland planning officials opened an investigation last month after repeated complaints about the warehouse. An inspector who went to the premises couldn't get inside, said Darin Ranelletti of the Oakland Planning Department.\n\nOnce the building is cleared, the investigation will turn to the cause of the fire. The district attorney warned of possible murder charges as she determines whether there were any crimes linked to the blaze.\n\nThe Ghost Ship fire is just the latest fire-related concert tragedy. In 2003, there was a fire caused by pyrotechnics at the Station Nightclub in Rhode Island, killing 100 people. In 2013, there was a nightclub fire in Brazil that left 238 people dead.\u00a0\n\nThe AP contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nYou can follow Blanche Johnson on Twitter @blancheFOXLA.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.0262258052825899, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 760, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.37956914463, "HarmVirtue": 12, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.63157894736842, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/01/11/loretta-swit-m-s-h-character-hot-lips-houlihan-was-raging-feminist-and-inspiration.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [484, 564, 767, 1050, 1060, 1119, 1186, 2883, 2953, 3140, 3183, 3508, 3567, 3654, 3887, 3942]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 786, "scraper_regex": 864}}, "headline": "Loretta Swit: 'M.A.S.H' character 'Hot Lips' Houlihan was 'a raging feminist' and an 'inspiration'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 864, "date": "20170111180000", "story_content": "Emmy winner Loretta Swit also happens to be a talented artist. The 79-year-old actress has just released a book of her paintings and drawings. Called \"Switheart,\" proceeds from the book will be donated to charities and programs that are dedicated to ending animal suffering and cruelty. She spoke to FOX411 about her activism and of course her role in \"M.A.S.H.\" as \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan.\u00a0\n\nFOX411: Did you realize that \"M.A.S.H\" would become a classic?\n\nLoretta Swit:\u00a0I don't think you ever realize that, but I will say that while we were shooting, even from the very beginning, we were aware of how very special it was. The symbiosis, the the camaraderie, the love and \u00a0respect we had for each other. And the material, to be blessed with those gifted writers starting of course with Larry Gelbart. So you had to know that this was going to be an incredible experience. That it turned into a phenomenon - no. There's no way we could have predicted that.\u00a0\n\nFOX411:\u00a0Major Houlihan was an amazing role model for girls.\n\nSwit:\u00a0Was she ever, was she ever!\n\nFOX411: Are you proud of that?\n\nSwit:\u00a0Of course! I had everything to do with making her that. We worked hand in hand with those writers. I was doing a play on Broadway during hiatus and we had a conference call with the producers and the writers and we talked about her future and they asked me, 'What do you see happening to her now? Where do you see her character going?' And I told them, I thought the relationship with Frank Burns had reached a point of no return and that they were writing her brighter. He was not a good doctor and she was in awe of the expertise of the other doctors and she was such a good nurse. He was married. It was a flawed relationship which demeaned her and it could not continue.\n\nI had the idea that she would go on R&R to Tokyo and she would meet someone who had a higher rank than Frank who was single and available and she would fall in love and get engaged and married. My producer said, 'And then what?' So I said, 'Then she finds out he was cheating on her and they get divorced.' And she gets back into town single and liberated knowing that her work was very fulfilling and she didn't necessarily need a partner in life to fulfill herself. She was doing a good job and it filled her with self-respect and honor and she became a bigger person on her own rather than either in a demeaning relationship or one that was disloyal. For Margaret it was a tremendous growing process. We watched her evolve and that was a joy. She was a tremendous role model. I still get letters from people saying they became nurses because of what they saw her do. She was an inspiration to young women. She was a raging feminist working in a man's world and being her own person. Being strong and having integrity.\u00a0\n\nFOX411: The show was on right at the end of the Vietnam War.\n\nSwit:\u00a0We would be mistaken very often for which war it was and our reply was always the same: \"It doesn't matter. War is wrong. It's hell. It's ugly. Let's stop doing it.\" So it didn't matter.\u00a0\n\nFOX411: It's still on constantly.\n\nSwit:\u00a0It never has been off the air. \"M.A.S.H\" went into syndication in year three and it's never been off the air. From year one to year eleven. So from year three to the present day it's been in syndication globally. It's a lot of coverage and I have a lot of friends out there who consider me family. They feel that I'm family.\u00a0\n\nFOX411: Are you still in touch with your costars?\n\nSwit:\u00a0They're my family. It's like saying, 'Do you stay in touch with your family?'\n\nFOX411:\u00a0These watercolors you paint are beautiful. How long have you been painting?\n\nSwit: Since I was a kid. I won my first art prize when I was six. This was something I just did the way you get up and breathe and eat and shower.\n\nFOX411:\u00a0When did your love of animals and advocacy begin?Swit:\u00a0I think that's the same passion. I don't recall a moment in time when it occurred to me. It was, 'Doesn't everybody?' I thought everybody did what I did and I found out subsequently that they didn't and that there was a great need to teach people about it and so I pursued that avenue and I'm still doing that with the book. I'm still trying to tell people about the plight of our animals and what they can do to help. What we do in the humane environment, we have to do on our own. We need to realize that we need to do it. We cannot depend on any government taking control of that. We have to do it and we have to be after them to help us do it, certainly, to subsidize our work but we have to grab hold and do what we've been doing all this time.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.64778578281403, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 786, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 7, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.19315237851, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.67175572519084, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/05/former-obama-nsa-adviser-says-trump-call-with-taiwan-didnt-bother-me.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4863]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 764, "scraper_regex": 827}}, "headline": "Former Obama national security adviser says Trump call with Taiwan 'didn't bother me'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 827, "date": "20161206000000", "story_content": "President Obama's former national security adviser said Monday that President-elect Donald Trump's phone call with the president of Taiwan should not be seen as a big deal.\n\nOffering his perspective in an interview with Fox News, retired Marine Corps General Jim Jones said, \"That didn't bother me, I think the purists are flapping their wings and saying all kinds of things. Why they can't have a five minute conversation or whatever it was to say congratulations doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\"\n\n \"I think the Trump administration will have to find whatever the right course is, and the right things during their administration, but I wouldn't prejudge what that would be right now,\" Jones said. \"He's not the president of the United States right now, he's the president- elect. He's talking to a lot of people around the world and that's not necessarily a bad thing.\"\n\n Trump is the first president or president-elect to speak with a Taiwanese leader since the United States broke-off relations with Taiwan in 1979 under President Jimmy Carter, when his administration established formal relations with Beijing, marking the start of the one-China policy.\"\n\n \"I think the policy is fine,\" Jones said. \"I think we should lighten up a little bit about the importance of phone calls and signals that may or may not have been sent. I think policy is pretty stable and the Chinese relationship is very important.\"\n\n For the first time, China sent a pair of bombers capable of launching nuclear weapons to circle Taiwan, two US officials tell Fox News. The incident occurred November 26, less than a week before Trump's controversial call Friday with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, angering Chinese leaders who lodged a diplomatic protest the next day.\n\n Japan scrambled eight F-15 fighter jets to intercept the two Chinese H-6K bombers and their two escort planes at one point northeast of Taiwan, according to officials.\n\n Trump's response to critics of his phone call came in a tweet Friday.\n\n \"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.\"\n\n U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have totaled more than $46 billion since 1990. In December 2015, the United States, under President Obama, announced a $1.83 billion arms sales agreement with Taiwan, the first arms sale in four years.\n\n Critics were outraged that Trump had broken decades-long policy by speaking with Taiwan's president. When asked on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" Sunday if he thought Trump was speaking to the leader of a sovereign nation, Trump's future chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said, \"He knew exactly what was happening. But look, we have a lot of problems to solve in this country, and we're not going to solve them by just making believe that people don't exist. This is not a massive deviation of our policy.\"\n\n Since the Chinese civil war in the 1940s, China and Taiwan have been ruled separately. China claims sovereignty over the island.\n\n The White House was on the defensive Monday. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said officials had already made at least two calls to the Chinese.\n\n \"I can confirm that U.S. officials, including senior officials on the national security council, been in touch with their Chinese counterparts to reiterate our country's continued commitment to one-China policy,\" he said.\n\n Trade tariffs are another point of friction. China imposes a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, for instance, while the United States has either eliminated tariffs or charges two and a half percent or less for overseas products - a huge advantage for China.\n\n The flight around Taiwan consisted of two Chinese Xian H-6K bombers, along with two escort planes, a Tupolev Tu-154 and Shaanxi Y-8, flying around the island of Taiwan from mainland China, taking off and landing from two separate Chinese military bases.\n\n The escort jets were used to collect radar information and conduct other surveillance on American allies such as Japan, Fox News was told. The Chinese bombers stayed in international airspace, according to officials.\n\n At different points of the flight, Chinese J-10 and Su-30 fighter jets performed escort duties for the Chinese strategic bombers.\n\n \"China has steadily built up a massive military capability in the area around Taiwan. This isn't simply a matter of flying bombers. Understand that technically, we can't object to flying bombers near Taiwan if we are flying combat aircraft and reconnaissance aircraft near China. This is simply legal under international law,\" said Anthony H. Cordesman, the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"Taiwan faces a much more serious Chinese challenge than it has ever faced before.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nJennifer Griffin currently serves as a national security correspondent for FOX News Channel .

Four percent of pilots reported having suicidal thoughts within the past two weeks.\n\nThe survey offers one of the first snapshots of mental health among commercial pilots, who often don't disclose this type of illness to airline officials or aviation regulators because they fear negative career repercussions, said senior study author Joseph Allen, a public health researcher at Harvard University in Boston.\n\n\"It's understandable that pilots are reluctant to fully disclose mental health issues because of the potential that they will be grounded or declared not fit for duty,\" Allen told Reuters Health by email.\n\nWith roughly 140,000 active pilots flying more than 3 billion people worldwide each year, the survey results should put the airline industry on notice that many pilots need better access to mental health screening and treatment, Allen added.\n\nThe new findings come a year and a half after a Germanwings co-pilot who suffered from depression deliberately crashed a plane into the French Alps, killing 150 people.\n\nGlobally, roughly 350 million people suffer from depression. Effective treatments exist, but many people don't get them - often due to stigma.\n\nTo get a better picture of mental health among airline pilots, researchers conducted an anonymous online survey between April and December of 2015. Questions touched on a range of topics related to work and health in addition to depression.\n\nMost respondents came from the U.S., Canada and Australia.\n\nOut of nearly 3,500 pilots who participated in the survey, 1,848 completed the questions about mental health. Within this group, 233 (12.6 percent) met the criteria for likely depression and 75 (4.1 percent) reported having suicidal thoughts within the previous two weeks.\n\nAmong 1,430 participants who reported working as an airline pilot in the previous seven days at the time of the survey, 193 (13.5 percent) met the criteria for depression.\n\nA greater proportion of male pilots than female pilots reported that \"nearly every day\" they had experiences of loss of interest, feeling like a failure, trouble concentrating, and thinking they would be \"better off dead.\"\n\nWomen were more likely than men to have at least one day of poor mental health during the previous month, and were more likely to have been diagnosed with depression.\n\nThe study also found that depression was more likely when pilots took lots of sleep medication and when they experienced sexual or verbal harassment.\n\nLimitations of the study include the lack of medical records or exams to assess mental health symptoms pilots reported in the survey, the authors note.\n\n\"The study likely underestimates the amount of depression that exists among pilots, however, it cannot address the severity of the symptoms and the extent of individual impairment,\" Dr. Joseph Baskin, a psychiatrist at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.\n\nPilots may not tell their own doctors about feeling depressed because both having this diagnosis and taking antidepressants come with stigma and a fear of being grounded, said Dr. Blake Lollis, an aerospace medicine specialist at Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital in Washington who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nStill, this diagnosis isn't as career-ending as it used to be, Lollis added by email. They may cleared to fly, for example, while on anti-depressants, even if they would be grounded for severe depression accompanied by any psychotic symptoms.\n\n\"It is clear that depression is undertreated among pilots,\" said Dr. Alpo Vuorio, an aviation medicine researcher at the University of Helsinki in Finland who wasn't involved in the study.\n\n\"I hope that current discussions after the Germanwings accident has helped pilots to seek help more openly,\" Vuorio said by email.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.75539588928223, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 633, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.33608531425, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 9, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4218009478673, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.8181818181820001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/15/four-essential-lessons-general-james-mattis-taught-me-about-leadership.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2569]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 776, "scraper_regex": 855}}, "headline": "Four essential lessons General James Mattis taught me about leadership", "wordcount_as_scraped": 855, "date": "20170115200000", "story_content": "This week retired US Marine Corps General James Mattis will face the US Senate during confirmation hearings to become our next Secretary of Defense. If confirmed, Mattis will be the CEO of the largest workforce and most complex bureaucracy on the planet.\n\nSeveral years ago, I met General Mattis while writing a book about how leaders need to fight the immediacy of technological connectedness and take the time to think and reflect more deeply. \n\nWhile Mattis had no specific cure for the immediacy afforded by technology, he looked back at the harried months leading to the war in Iraq, where he led a large part of the ground invasion. He soberly told me, \"Eventually you can answer all your e-mails, run hither and fro from meeting to meeting; you can attack a country and pull down a statue, and then say, 'Now what do I do with it?'\"\n\nI could not know then the tremendous impact he would have on my way of thinking as a strategist and leader. And while I have never served in uniform, here are four lessons General Mattis taught me about leadership.\n\n1. Take the Time to Think and Reflect\n\nMattis values the time to be alone to think deeply, and he sees time spent in reflection as important for our national security. \n\nMattis loathes PowerPoint slides as a medium for briefing senior military leaders. He believes such presentations encourage speed of thought, confirmation bias and truncated assessments of multidimensional problems.\n\nHe taught me to be comfortable being alone with my strategic thoughts, noting how leaders manage their personal time for reflection is what makes or breaks them. \"Lack of reflection by senior leaders is the single biggest deficiency we have in the military today,\" he said.\n\n2. Read Often and Read Your History\n\nMattis had a legendary library that once traveled the world with him\u2014at one point, it featured almost as many titles as Thomas Jefferson sold to help create the Library of Congress. \n\nMattis would have those in any chain of his command read from a selection of these books. \n\nMattis taught me that leaders should never stop reading and humbling themselves before the next great idea, while grounding their thinking in the context of history that envelopes all decisions they will ever make.\n\n3. Get the Right Inputs or You'll Get the Wrong Outputs and Ideas\n\nMattis and now retired U.S. Army General David Petraeus taught me that the leader who allows divergent thinkers in the room gets you to a breakthrough strategy and the right big ideas.\u00a0 \n\nMattis and Petraeus jointly commissioned an unprecedented revision of the Counter Insurgency Guidance during the Iraq War. With their guidance, troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan obtained a bold new set of ideas that they could take to the battlefield.\n\n\"The problem [with revising the Counter-Insurgency doctrine] would have been if you only had people working the content who knew infantry, the cockpit of a plane, or the bridge of a ship,\" he said. Adding a historic perspective, Mattis continued, \"You need people who have studied the human condition, and who have studied war . . . and have spent as much time reading Nelson Mandela or Marcus Aurelius as they have spent on their tactics books.\"\n\n4. Empathy and Trust Are the Glue That Binds\n\nMattis taught me that trust is fragile\u2014and it can only be delivered by leaders who can put themselves in the shoes of those they lead. \n\nHaving studied war his entire adult life, Mattis understands that trust binds a solider to his or her leadership. \"The more you fight, the more you realize you must have an institutional cohesion that allows you to implicitly trust those under your command. Instilling trust is still difficult because war has so much fear and fatigue associated with it. The veneer of civilization gets rubbed off,\" Mattis stated.\n\nAs he prepared troops for the ground war in Iraq both mentally and physically, he never shied away from revealing the most disturbing possibilities. \n\nHe communicated to his troops frankly saying, \"We'd talk about what it was going to be like if the troops got what we called 'slimed' or coated with chemical weapons. \n\nI told them you're going to have to fight what we called 'dirty' for 24 hours.\" \"Dirty\" referred to the troops possibly needing to defecate inside their own suits as they allowed time for the chemicals to dissipate.\n\nMattis then told the troops to think about what they would need to do after a chemical weapons attack. \n\nAfter the troops came back to base, he said they would take off their suits, put them in a pile, and then burn them. \n\nEver a warrior as much as a thinker, Mattis advised: \"We're going to clean you and your vehicles. We're going to give you all new gear, and then we're going to send you back to kill the people who did it to you.\"\n\n\n\nDaniel Patrick Forrester is the CEO of the consultancy THRUUE Inc.

Bryan Asrary, 24, is charged with posing as the pop star to lure minors into sending nude photos, and then threatening them if they did not send more.\n\nIt turns out this kind of online extortion is becoming one of the biggest dangers to kids online, according to an April 2016 report to Congress by the U.S. Department of Justice. The National Strategy for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction reports 60 percent of survey respondents reported dealing with this type of cyber behavior. The survey respondents were comprised of more than 1,000 investigators, law enforcement managers, prosecutors, analysts, victim service providers, and Department of Justice grant recipients.\u00a0\n\nThe report also showed \u00a0that \"sextortion cases tend to have more minor victims per offender than all other child sexual exploitation offenses.\"\n\n\"Minors are more vulnerable than ever before because many of them are online with zero barriers between themselves and whatever amoral sociopath might be targeting them,\" clinical psychologist Dr. Chloe Carmichael told Fox News.\u00a0\"Many minors take and send photos of themselves in compromising positions out of a desire for attention, or a misguided belief that this makes them mature.\"\n\nAnti-revenge porn activist Dr. Charlotte Laws says sextortion \"is about exerting power, and it is a form of blackmail. It is sexual abuse and has led to suicides. Victims tend to withdraw from family members and experience severe emotional trauma.\"\n\nLaws said there are two main sextortion ploys.\n\n\"The first is trust-related. The perpetrator tricks a victim into trusting him (or her) and into providing compromising photos or video,\" Laws said. \"The second is the malware-related ploy, which secretly shifts on a victim's webcam.The perpetrator is able to capture and save nude images. He can later extort money from the victim or scam her into providing additional compromising material.\"\n\nBruce Anderson, Director of Cyber Investigations & Intelligence at Cyber Investigation Services LLC, says \u00a0\"Children are easy to manipulate. Once they think they've done something bad like send a naked photo, they become an ongoing source to fuel child pornography. Parents know what your kids are doing on their devices. Sextortionists can absolutely destroy children.\"\n\nShould someone become a victim of sextortion, Carrie Goldberg, an Internet and sexual privacy lawyer at C. A. Goldberg, PLLC, says victims should go to the police and talk to an attorney to learn their state's laws on sexual blackmail.\n\n\"If somebody is the victim of a extorter, the first thing they need to do is stop engaging with the offender, even if he or she provides a deadline. Depending on the circumstances and state, coercion, harassment and other laws may be triggered even if that state does not have a specific sextortion bill,\" said Goldberg. \"The victim should erase no evidence, even embarrassing evidence, and take screenshots of everything, including whatever social media accounts the offender is using. Report it to the police. Tell a lawyer especially if the offender is anonymous, lawyers can help de-anonymize. Tell a friend.\"\n\nDr. Laws has additional tips for protecting yourself from sextortion:\n\nCover your webcam with a sticker or tape. Turn off your computer when not in use, and unplug your stand-alone webcam. \n Never send compromising photos or video to anyone, regardless of who they are. \n Be careful about all online interaction. Never say or do anything that you would not want known to the world. Be aware that there are hundreds of predators online, and many are located overseas (and thus out of reach by law enforcement).\u00a0\u00a0 \n Use strong passwords and do not open unexpected attachments. Also, be sure your computer anti-virus is up-to-date. \n\n\n\n\nFox News.com Reporter and FOX411 host Diana Falzone covers celebrity news and interviews some of today's top celebrities and newsmakers. \u00a0You can follow her on Twitter @dianafalzone.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.17307662963867, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 503, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 2, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.43739893644, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.1809145129224596, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/05/lawmakers-craft-cybersecurity-agenda-for-trump.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3756]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 644, "scraper_regex": 603}}, "headline": "Lawmakers craft cybersecurity agenda for Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 603, "date": "20170105210000", "story_content": "A task force of bipartisan lawmakers on Thursday released a report recommending a detailed cybersecurity agenda for the incoming Trump administration, even as the issue dominates talk on Capitol Hill.\n\n\nThe panel, co-chaired by House Homeland Security Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse. D-R.I., released the 34-page report in a press conference in which they outlined the top priorities for preventing foreign hacks of sensitive data.\n\n\"A silent war is waged against us in cyber space \u2013if we don't shape it, it will be shaped against us,\" McCaul said. \"Every person in this room is a target and the phones in your pocket ar the battle space \u2013and the enemy is winning.\"\n\nThe Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) sponsored the CSIS Cyber Policy Task Force, which produced the report. A similar report was presented to then President-elect Barack Obama in 2009, and compiled by a commission also served by McCaul.\n\nAlthough Trump has expressed skepticism aboutthe U.S. intelligence community's claim that Russia was behind hacks that may have influenced the election, there is reason to believe his team will take heed of the task force's report. Co-chair and former national director of U.S. Cyber Challenge Karen Evans, who was on the task force from its inception, is now a member of the Trump transition team.\n\n\"We have given the report to the transition team at their request,\" CSIS Senior Vice President James Lewis told FoxNews.com. \"There are issues I know they are particularly interested in, so we will get traction in those areas.\"\n\nMcCaul said cybersecurity must never become a partisan issue and called for a major reorganization and consolidation of domestic civilian cyber defense efforts into a single, strong cybersecurity agency at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nWhitehouse agreed that a single specialized office could attract world class talent and improve cyber security measures.\n\nLewis said a review of DHS by the task force determined that as little as 2 percent of its budget went to the department's cybersecurity division.\n\n\"If the Trump administration is going to be serious about this, they need to give DHS the focus and resources to make cybersecurity a primary concern,\" Lewis said. \"The transition team holds their cards close to their vest, but I'm confident they'll pick up the ball from where it's been left on the field and run with it\u2014I think that's a good thing.\"\n\nThe task force, Sen. Whitehouse urged, also strongly recommends the appointment of a new cybersecurity coordinator, and the push to elevate the position to assistant to the President.\n\nThe press conference on Capitol Hill Thursday convened at the same time as the Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing on Russian hacks.\n\n\"The President-elect wants stronger relationships with Russia and to change the dynamics we have with Russia,\" McCaul said during the press conference. \"There are radical Islamist forces that will perhaps be more aggressive in attacks against Russia and I think it is an opportunity for us to work with them, but Russia is not our friend \u2013 [President Vladimir] Putin is not our friend.\"\n\nBut one former operator within the NSA and current CEO of Soteria, Chris O'Rourke, a small cybersecurity firm based in Charleston, S.C., told FoxNews.com the government needs to create a better pipeline to share information to smaller firms with budgetary restrictions.\n\n\"The reason policies have failed under the Obama administration is because they made it somewhat of a 'big boy club,' a pay-to-play operation, but the innovation is in the smaller cyber security companies,\" O'Rourke said, noting smaller agencies are filled with former federal\u00a0 cybersecurity operatives. \"We are former hackers fighting hackers.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.130039006471634, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 644, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.86308195745, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9503105590062098, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/11/14/mothers-to-be-struggle-worry-in-ruins-storm-hit-haiti.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [74, 235, 243, 519, 525, 938, 946, 1310, 1761, 1767, 2315, 2786, 2792, 4136, 4144, 4174, 4185, 4715, 4721]}}, "headline": "Mothers-to-be struggle, worry in ruins of storm-hit Haiti", "wordcount_as_scraped": 968, "date": "20161114130000", "story_content": "COTEAUX, Haiti \u2013 \u00a0Nathanaelle Bernard was two months short of the due date for her first child when Hurricane Matthew crashed through her town overlooking the Caribbean Sea along\u00a0Haiti's\u00a0southwestern coast.\n\nThe storm, with its 145 mph winds, destroyed her small home of cinder blocks. Powerful waves carried away most of her belongings, including the clothing and blankets she had managed to collect for her baby. She's now anxiously awaiting the birth amid the\u00a0ruins\u00a0of her town, with even food and fresh water scarce.\n\n\"I always had this dream my child wouldn't want for anything,\" the 19-year-old said on a recent morning, her face glowing with sweat as she cradled her swollen belly. After a pause, she added: \"It was a nice dream.\"\n\nShe shares a makeshift hut with five members of her extended family and her precarious situation is emblematic of an alarming situation across\u00a0Haiti's\u00a0southwestern peninsula in the wake of the storm. The U.N. Population Fund says nearly 14,000 women are due to give birth in the next three months amid widespread shortages of meat, clean water and housing in an area where poor sanitation has created ideal conditions for cholera and other diseases.\n\nEven in the best of times, pregnancy and childbirth is risky in\u00a0Haiti, which has the highest maternal mortality ratio in the Western Hemisphere. Many rural women give birth at home, often with untrained midwives who administer care using leaves made into tea, smoke or steam.\n\nThe Haitian government, with international assistance, has implemented programs that have helped reduce the maternal death rate by nearly half over the past decade. But, with 359 women dying for every 100,000 births due to complications,\u00a0Haiti\u00a0is on par with countries such as Ethiopia and Madagascar, according to the U.N.\n\nMany experts fear the advances have been rolled back by Hurricane Matthew, which made landfall on the peninsula Oct. 4. The government says the storm killed 546 people and destroyed the crops and livestock that people like Bernard and her family depend on for survival.\n\n\"It is tragic that a single storm can tear up so much of this progress, and that in a single day we can be set back by years,\" said Marielle Sander, representative for the U.N. Population Fund in\u00a0Haiti.\n\nThroughout the disaster zone, health clinics and hospitals have been badly damaged and medicine is in short supply, adding what Sander calls a \"lethal combination\" of factors that threaten pregnant women and newborns, especially those born with complications.\n\nAt the general hospital in Les Cayes, the region's largest city, about a dozen pregnant women sought care on a recent morning, some complaining about symptoms of high blood pressure. Expecting women in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0are disproportionately threatened by disorders such as eclampsia and pre-eclampsia, which bring high blood pressure and can cause seizures, heart failure and hemorrhaging.\n\n\"Before the hurricane we didn't have enough antibiotics and other medication. But now the situation's harder. We need more of a lot of things,\" said Lucie Naomie Lafortune, the ward's head nurse.\n\nBernard occasionally gets shooting pains in her stomach, retreating to a bed in the shack her uncle built from scavenged materials after the family's home was destroyed. She curls up with her eyes shut tight, taking acetaminophen she got from a nurse.\n\nShe tries her best to push out negative thoughts. But that's tough to do while undernourished and with little protection from any number of diseases stalking people here, including the mosquito-borne Zika virus that can cause serious birth defects if women are infected while pregnant.\n\nRomual Saint-Jean, the 27-year-old father of her unborn child, moved Bernard to her uncle's coastal village from Port-au-Prince after she contracted typhoid in early 2016. They believed Coteaux's salt air and slow-paced life would do her good.\n\nNow, he desperately wants to move the family overseas but has no idea how that might happen. Saint-Jean, who lost his $300-a-month job in July as a Portuguese-Haitian Creole translator for\u00a0Haiti's\u00a0U.N. peacekeeping mission, is\u00a0struggling\u00a0to find work.\n\n\"I don't see a future here,\" he said after returning from another discouraging job-hunting effort in the capital.\n\nThe young couple met last year in the back of a \"tap-tap,\" colorfully painted group taxis that connect Haitians to jobs, markets and each other. Saint-Jean told buddies he thought he had met his future wife.\n\nPretty soon, Bernard was pregnant. They were happy and excited, even if the baby wasn't planned.\n\nBut the pressures are growing and she sometimes has to steel herself to hold back tears.\n\n\"I\u00a0worry\u00a0most about nutrition,\" said Bernard, who subsists mainly on rice, corn meal and bean sauce. \"How can my baby be strong if I'm not eating well?\"\n\nAssociated Press journalists accompanied Bernard to the public hospital in the wrecked town of Port Salut, where she got a free checkup. But she couldn't afford an ultrasound to find out the baby's sex before delivery.\n\nSome of the young couple's happiest times are debating names. With a pealing laugh, Nathanaelle said she only knows it won't be Fabienne or Fabiola if it's a girl because she dislikes names that begin with \"F.\" A Pentecostal pastor recently placed his hands on her swollen belly and suggested Jonas if it's a boy.\n\nGrimacing slightly as she hoisted herself from a wooden bench, she prepared for the most relaxing part of her day: Lowering herself into the gently lapping sea and giving her swollen ankles a rest.\n\nBernard knows her family's immediate prospects are not good. But when she's floating in the shallows she meditates on what remains.\n\n\"We lost the things we had. But we're not lost,\" she said after drying herself on the sandy beach where she and her neighbors bury their waste. \"We're alive. Our baby is alive. And that's what's most important.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.69348669052124, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 929, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.06505758029, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 4, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114130000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 2.4757804090419797, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/25/military-parade-for-donald-trump-has-come-early.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "The military parade for Donald Trump has come early", "wordcount_as_scraped": 903, "date": "20161125180000", "story_content": "The military parade for Donald Trump has come early. Two months before Inauguration Day festivities, an extraordinary number of recently retired generals, including some who clashed with President Barack Obama's administration, are marching to the president-elect's doorstep for job interviews.\n\nIt's not unusual for an incoming administration to consider a retired general for a top position like CIA director. But Trump has turned to retired officers so publicly and in such large numbers that it raises questions about the proper balance of military and civilian advice in a White House led by a commander in chief with no defense or foreign policy experience.\n\nThe tilt toward military officials may reflect a limited pool of civilian options. Many officials from previous Republican administrations politically disowned Trump during the campaign, calling him unqualified. And Trump suggested he wouldn't want many of them, as he vowed to \"drain the swamp\" by running establishment figures out of town.\n\nBUSINESSES BRACE FOR TRUMP DECISION ON HB-1 VISAS IN WAKE OF SESSIONS PICK\n\nRobert Goldich, a retired government defense analyst who has watched administrations for 44 years, says Trump's focus on retired generals might be unprecedented.\n\nThe only one announced for a top job thus far is Michael Flynn, a retired three-star Army general. Trump appointed Flynn as his national security adviser, a post that does not require Senate confirmation but is central to a president's decision-making process. Flynn was forced out as Defense Intelligence Agency director in 2014. Afterward, he strongly criticized the Obama administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State group and threw his support to Trump.\n\nAmong others under consideration are two retired four-star Marine generals \u2014 James Mattis for defense secretary and John Kelly for homeland security secretary. Other names surfacing include retired Army Gen. Jack Keane and David Petraeus, the retired four-star general who was Obama's CIA director in 2011-12 before resigning amid disclosure that he had an affair with his biographer and shared highly classified information with her.\n\nIn remarks to The New York Times on Tuesday, Trump spoke about the Pentagon post in ways that offer insight into why he is attracted to former generals like Mattis.\n\nHOUSE GOP BUSINESS-TAX PLAN UPENDS U.S. POLICY\n\n\"I think it's time maybe, it's time for a general,\" Trump said, suggesting he favors a military mindset. \"Look what's going on. We don't win, we can't beat anybody.\"\n\nKelly retired this year after a storied career capped by commanding the U.S. Southern Command, where he differed with the White House over closing the Guantanamo Bay prison and expressed doubts about the administration's moves to open all combat jobs to women.\n\nBing West, a Vietnam War veteran and former assistant secretary of defense, said Trump's outreach to retired generals is wise.\n \"Our country is fighting a long war. It's common sense to seek the experience of those who have proven they know how to fight,\" he said in an email exchange.\n\nThe concern about undue military influence derives from a long U.S. tradition of civilian control of the military, which is the basis for a ban on active-duty officers running the Pentagon. The Constitution affirms civilian control by making the president the commander in chief and giving Congress the authority to declare war and fund the military.\n\nThe appointment of too many generals to high civilian positions could prompt fears that Trump is on a path to militarizing U.S. foreign policy or giving the military too much sway in decisions about war and peace.\n\nBut that view was rejected by Richard Fontaine, president of the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. In an interview, he noted that it was President George W. Bush's civilian advisers who pushed hardest to launch the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\n\"In my experience, veterans have been less likely than the civilians to advocate for military intervention abroad,\" said Fontaine, who was among dozens of Republican national security figures who signed a letter during the campaign warning that Trump would be a dangerous president.\n\nStill, some retired generals are leery of Trump stacking his national security team with warriors.\n\n\"The biggest fear is too many generals in politics. That's not a good thing,\" said Mark Hertling, a retired three-star Army general who opposed Trump. \"But given the lack of knowledge of a president who knows nothing about diplomacy or the military, they might provide some very good advice.\"\n\nHertling credits Mattis with an unusual knack for leadership and strategic thinking. Trump met with Mattis last weekend but has not said if he will nominate him. If he does, Trump would need Congress to provide an exception to a law requiring a military officer to have been out of uniform for at least seven years before becoming defense secretary.\n\nThat exception has been sought only once since the position of defense secretary was created in 1947.

Rivulets of water ran through the dirt, washing away chunks of ancient stone.\n\nThe city of Nimrud in northern Iraq is in pieces, victim of the Islamic State group's fervor to erase history. The remains of its palaces and temples, once lined in brilliant reliefs of gods and kings, have been blown up. The statues of winged bulls that once guarded the site are hacked to bits. Its towering ziggurat, or step pyramid, has been bulldozed.\n\nThe militants' fanaticism devastated one of the Middle East's most important archaeological sites. But more than a month after the militants were driven out, Nimrud is still being ravaged, its treasures disappearing, imperiling any chance of eventually rebuilding it, an Associated Press team found after multiple visits last month.\n\nWith the government and military still absorbed in fighting the war against the Islamic State group in nearby Mosul, the wreckage of the Assyrian Empire's ancient capital lies unprotected and vulnerable to looters.\n\n\"When I heard about Nimrud, my heart wept before my eyes did,\" said Hiba Hazim Hamad, an archaeology professor in Mosul who often took her students there.\n\nIn three of the AP's four visits, its team wandered the ruins alone freely for up to an hour before anyone arrived. No one is assigned to guard the site, much less catalog the fragments.\n\nToppled stone slabs bearing a relief that the AP saw on one visit were gone when it returned.\n\nPerhaps the only vigilant guardian left is an Iraqi archaeologist, Layla Salih. She has visited multiple times, photographing the wreckage to document it and badgering militias to watch over it. Walking through the ruins on a rainy winter day, she pointed out things that were no longer in place.\n\nStill, Salih finds reasons for optimism.\n\n\"The good thing is the rubble is still in situ,\" she said. \"The site is restorable.\"\n\nTo an untrained eye, that's hard to imagine, seeing the destruction caused by the Islamic State group. Salih estimated 60 percent of the site was irrecoverable.\n\nThe site's palaces and temples were spread over 360 hectares (900 acres) on a dirt plateau on the edge of the Tigris River valley.\n\nA 140-foot-high ziggurat once arrested the gaze of anyone entering Nimrud. Now there is only lumpy earth. Archaeologists had never had a chance to explore the now-bulldozed structure.\n\nPast it, in the palace of King Ashurnasirpal II, walls are toppled into giant piles of bricks. The palace's courtyard is a field of cratered earth. Pieces of the two monumental winged bulls are piled nearby \u2014 their heads missing, likely taken to be sold.\n\nOff to the left are the flattened remains of the temple of Nabu, a god of writing. During a Dec. 14 UNESCO assessment tour, a U.N. demining expert peered at a hole leading to a seemingly intact tomb and warned that it could be rigged to explode.\n\nFrom 879-709 BC, Nimrud was the capital of the Assyrians, one the ancient world's earliest empires. In modern excavations , the site yielded a wealth of Mesopotamian art. In the tombs of queens were found troves of gold and jewelry. Hundreds of written tablets deepened knowledge about the ancient Mideast.\n\nTouring the site, UNESCO's representative to Iraq, Louise Haxthausen, called the destruction \"absolutely devastating.\"\n\n\"The most important thing right now is to ensure some basic protection,\" she said.\n\nBut the government has many priorities. It is still fighting IS in Mosul, and the list of reconstruction needs is long.\n\nTens of thousands of citizens live in camps. Much of the city of Ramadi is destroyed. More than 70 mass graves have been unearthed in IS territory. Other ancient sites remain under IS control.\n\nNone of the various armed groups around Nimrud \u2014 whether the military or various militias \u2014 has been dedicated to guarding it.\n\nDuring the UNESCO tour, Salih noticed that some of the ancient bricks from the rubble had been neatly piled up as if to be hauled away \u2014 perhaps, she suspects, to repair homes damaged in fighting. Stone tiles at the palace entrance vanished from where she saw them last.\n\nTwo locals were arrested with a marble tablet and stone seal from Nimrud, presumably to sell. The men are in custody.\n\nBut it's unclear where the artifacts seized from them are.\n\nThe police insisted they were at a lab in the northern city of Irbil. The lab said it knew nothing about them. The Antiquities Ministry in Baghdad said they were safe in the Nineveh government offices. An official there said they were with the police awaiting transit to Baghdad.\n\nThat circle of confusion makes theft easy.\n\nSalih is seeking international funding to pay someone to guard the site. But she recognizes the job will have to go to one of the militia factions, and she has no illusions they will provide full protection.\n\nShe'll have to cajole them into doing as much as they can.\n\n\"There isn't another choice, as you see,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press photographer Maya Alleruzzo and videographer Bram Janssen in Nimrud; and Salar Salim and Mohammed Nouman in Irbil, Iraq, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nRead previous reports in the AP's series \"A Savage Legacy\" chronicling the impact of the Islamic State group at: https://www.ap.org/explore/a-savage-legacy/\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.0254235267639205, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 845, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 4, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.8632755905500002, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170106090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9585798816568, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/14/questionable-reports-trump-fueled-violence-proliferate-on-social-media.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [351, 449, 2505, 2925, 3739]}}, "headline": "Questionable reports of Trump-fueled violence proliferate on social media", "wordcount_as_scraped": 652, "date": "20161114200000", "story_content": "As if the 2016 climate couldn't get any more divisive, false or questionable reports of violence linked to Donald Trump's victory have gained steady traction on social media since last week \u2013 complicating efforts to distinguish fact from fiction amid very real political unrest.\u00a0\n\nIn one case, a student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette claimed that two white men \u2013\u00a0one wearing a Trump hat \u2013 jumped out of a sedan, attacked her, and stole her hijab and her wallet. The unnamed woman also said the men knocked her to the ground and screamed racial slurs at her.\n\nNews of the attack quickly spread on social media, and soon some national media outlets including CNN began reporting it. The attack also was quickly condemned by the state branch of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nSTUDENTS STAGE MASS WALKOUTS TO PROTEST TRUMP\n\n\"The ACLU of Louisiana is outraged at the news of a young Muslim woman being assaulted and robbed of her hijab in Lafayette yesterday morning,\" the organization said in a written statement. \"The report that her attackers also shouted slurs and wore Donald Trump clothing is especially troubling in light of Mr. Trump's frequent use of anti-Muslim rhetoric on the campaign trail.\"\n\nThe problem is: the incident was fabricated.\n\n\"There were a lot of things that didn't make sense,\" Lafayette police spokesman Karl Ratcliff told The Acadiana Advocate. Ratcliff said the student ultimately confessed to making up the entire story after police pressed her for details.\n\nAnother report of questionable origin making the rounds involves a supposed surge in transgender teen suicides tied to the election. Claims that Trump's victory triggered at least 10 suicides surfaced Wednesday when some started posting Facebook updates saying the information came from private support groups for parents with transgender children.\n\nThe stat was given a global spotlight after Guardian writer and Out magazine editor-at-large Zach Stafford tweeted that \"at least 8 trans youth have committed suicide in the wake of Trump's win.\" He went on to report 10 teens took their lives.\n\nStafford later admitted he had no evidence to back up claims that any transgender teens had killed themselves because of Trump.\n\nSuch accounts have only muddled the picture of the very real unrest to seize the country since last week's election. Harassment or violence has been attributed to both sides, in several documented cases.\u00a0\n\nIn the upstate New York town of Wellsville, police have launched an investigation after someone drew a swastika symbol and spray-painted \"Make America White Again\" on the back wall of a community softball league's dugout.\n\nIn Michigan's Royal Oak Middle School, students were caught on video during their lunch period chanting \"build the wall.\"\n\nRoyal Oak Schools Superintendent Shawn Lewis-Lakin wrote in a statement\u00a0that officials \"addressed this incident when it occurred.\"\n\n\"We are working with our students to help them understand the impact of their words and actions on others in their school community,\" Lewis-Lakin wrote.\n\nIn Silver Spring, Md., an Episcopal church in a heavily Latino suburb was vandalized. A banner advertising the church's Spanish-language service was slashed Saturday night and the words \"Trump nation. Whites only\" were written on the back. The same phrase was written on a brick wall in the church's memorial garden.\n\nLast week, the beating of a suspected Trump supporter also was captured on video in Chicago.\n\nTwo Florida homes reportedly were vandalized with anti-Trump messages \u2013 this, as protests broke out in cities across the country, with one in Portland causing significant property damage.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, the Ku Klux Klan announced it plans to hold a victory rally for Trump in North Carolina next month.\n\nTrump addressed the recent outbreak of racist rhetoric during an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired on Sunday.\n\n\"I am so saddened to hear that and I'll say stop it, if it helps,\" he said when asked about the reports. \"I'll say it right to the camera \u2013 stop it.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.5636897087097195, "HarmVice": 9, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 649, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.80951397086, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114200000, "PurityVirtue": 3, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6979969183358996, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/23/alleged-victims-pedophile-priests-say-pope-francis-was-made-aware-in-2014.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 550, "scraper_regex": 578}}, "headline": "Alleged victims of pedophile priests say Pope Francis was made aware in 2014", "wordcount_as_scraped": 578, "date": "20161223170000", "story_content": "The clerical sex abuse scandal unfolding at an institute for hearing impaired children in Argentina is now touching Pope Francis himself, after alleged victims of Rev. Nicola Corradi said they wrote a letter to the pontiff in 2014 warning him that the purported pedophile had been reassigned to the South American country.\n\nCorradi, 82, and another priest, 55-year-old Horacio Corbacho, were arrested last month along with three employees for the alleged abuse of at least 24 deaf children who attended the Antonio Provolo Institute, in the city of Mendoza.\n\nPolice raided the institute and found magazines featuring naked women and about $34,000 in Corradi's room.\n\nThe victims' families contend that the Vatican knew about him since at least 2009, when he was publicly accused of abusing students at the Provolo Institute in Verona, Italy, where he then worked.\n\nThey allege nothing was done then nor later in 2014, when they told Pope Francis in a letter that Corradi was living in his native Argentina.\n\nAll five suspects in the Mendoza case are being held in jail and have not spoken publicly since their arrest.\n\n\"From the pope down ... all of the Catholic Church hierarchy is the same. They all knew,\" one of the victims told The Associated Press through a sign language interpreter.\n\nAnother victim said the priests would rape again if released.\n\n\"This happened in Italy ... it happened again here, and it must end,\" the victim said, insisting on speaking anonymously. \"Enough!\"\n\nVictims and prosecutors say the anal and vaginal rapes, fondling and oral sex by the priests took place in the bathrooms, dorms, garden and a basement at the school in Lujan de Cuyo, a city about 620 miles northwest of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe school has \"a little chapel with an image of the Virgin and some chairs where the kids would get confession and receive the communion. That's where some of the acts were happening,\" Fabrizio Sidoti, the prosecutor who has been leading the investigation since the scandal broke, told the AP.\n\nChildren from other regions of Argentina who lived at the dorms were especially vulnerable and often targeted by the abusers. The tales are harrowing: One of the victims told the AP she witnessed how a girl was raped by one priest while the other one forced her to give him oral sex.\n\nThe prosecutor is expecting more than 20 other people to provide testimony and more victims to come forward.\n\nPope Francis has not spoken publicly about the case and the Vatican declined to comment.\n\nAdvocates of sex abuse victims by priests question how Francis could have been unaware of Corradi's misdeeds, given he was publicly named by the Italy victims.\n\n\"No other pope has spoken as passionately about the evil of child sex abuse as Francis. No other pope has invoked 'zero tolerance' as often. No other pope has promised accountability of church superiors,\" said Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability, an online resource about clerical abuse. \"In light of the crimes against the helpless children in Mendoza, the Pope's assurances seem empty indeed.\"\n\nOn Dec. 11, the pope appeared in a video using sign language to wish deaf people worldwide a merry Christmas \u2014 a gesture that fell particularly flat in Argentina as Catholics struggle with the enormity of the scandal.\n\n\"Either he lives outside of reality or this is enormously cynical ... it's a mockery,\" said Carlos Lombardi, an attorney who specializes in canon law.\n\nBased on reporting by the Associated Press.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -9.19540214538574, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 550, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.81363066757, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 3, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161223170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.54545454545455, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/03/conservatives-fear-midnight-litigation-as-obama-looks-to-secure-legacy.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [258, 1220, 1716, 2053, 2436, 2526, 3086, 3555]}}, "headline": "Conservatives fear 'midnight litigation,' as Obama looks to secure legacy", "wordcount_as_scraped": 611, "date": "20170103220000", "story_content": "Conservatives worried about President Obama's plans for imposing so-called \"midnight regulations\" on his way out of the White House say they now have a new concern: Midnight litigation.\u00a0\n\nAs Obama works to secure his legacy in the final days of his administration, critics worry the outgoing president may saddle his successor with new federal legal action targeting U.S. businesses. A coalition of conservative groups warned that such a push may be in the works, in a recent letter to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who leads the Donald Trump transition team.\n\n\"It has come to our attention that a number of Departments and independent agencies are working furiously behind closed doors to bring significant, legally tenuous litigation against American business interests before January 20, 2017,\" the letter reads.\n\nIt goes on to appeal to the incoming administration to drop any such litigation immediately once Trump takes office.\n\n\"Should the Obama Administration bring non-routine, last minute, legally unorthodox midnight litigation, your Administration should not hesitate to withdraw immediately from that litigation,\" the letter says. \u00a0\n\nThe letter's co-signers include Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, President of Frontiers for Freedom George Landrith, The Heartland Institute's Horace Cooper and dozens of other conservative voices.\n\n\nWhile the letter does not mention any specific lawsuits they believe the administration is looking to file, the warning comes as the Obama administration already is taking a slew of actions in its final weeks -- following GOP warnings about last-minute midnight regulations.\u00a0\n\nIn December, Obama ordered U.S.-owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean placed \"indefinitely\" off-limits for future oil and gas leases, granted a record number of pardons and commutations for a single day, and killed off a once-mandatory registry for immigrant men from predominantly Muslim countries.\u00a0\n\nOn Thursday, Obama also announced a series of sanctions aimed at Russia over alleged interference in the U.S. election \u2013 moves that Trump has opposed.\n\nPolitico reported in November that the administration has eyed regulations on commodities speculation, air pollution from the oil industry and doctors' Medicare drug payments as possible parts to a midnight flurry of regulation.\u00a0\n\nWhether Obama agencies will turn next to a final wave of litigation remains to be seen.\u00a0\n\nThe New York Times reported last week that the Environmental Protection Agency is considering declaring Alaskan cities non-compliant with the Clean Air Act due to the widespread use of wood stoves \u2013 a move that could lead to the cutoff of federal transportation funds.\n\nHouse Republicans concerned about a last-minute regulatory push by the administration in November passed the Midnight Rules Relief Act, which would make it easier to undo multiple regulations pushed through at the end of an administration. Republicans re-introduced that measure Tuesday.\u00a0\n\nHowever, the letter to Pence notes that while existing law provides some protection against these for Congress, there is no similar protection against \"midnight litigation,\" leaving it up to the administration itself to drop such legal action.\n\n\"In such circumstances, the new Administration should not be constrained by notions of deference and should not support suspect legal theories that could have devastating economic effects for decades to come,\" they wrote.\u00a0\n\nDemocratic strategist David Mercer argued that while there is no sign the administration is doing this, Obama has the right to do as he likes, as he is president until Jan. 20.\n\n\"[Obama] has the right through the courts, through legislation or other means ... to put in place what he says as being in order in handing over peacefully the transition of government,\" Mercer said on FoxNews.com's \"Strategy Room.\"\n\n\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

Demetrick Pennie argued that the three social media platforms \"knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group HAMAS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda.\"\n\n\"We want to hold these companies accountable for allowing terrorists to use their sites as an instrument to conduct terrorist operations,\" Pennie's lawyer, Keith Altman, told FoxNews.com. \"Google, Facebook and Twitter profit from terrorist postings and create new content when they combine postings with advertisements targeted at specific viewers.\"\n\nJohnson, a 25-year-old Army Reserve Afghan War veteran and Black Nationalist, carried out an \"ambush-style\" attack on Dallas law enforcement during a protest in Texas over the recent police-related killings of two African-American men. Johnson was eventually killed by a robot-delivered bomb.\n\n\"It was unreal,\" Pennie, who was good friends with two of the officers killed, told FoxNews.com. \"Seeing guys shot like that, I just can't shake it.\"\n\nWhile he has not been linked to any foreign terror organization, Johnson did visit and like numerous websites dedicated to the Black Lives Matter movement, the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party \u2013 all of whom have sympathized with the Palestinian cause.\n\n\"The New Black Panther Party and other black separatist groups are directly linking themselves to Palestian groups and they are sharing this stuff on Facebook,\" Pennie, who is also the president of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation and a 17-year law enforcement veteran, told FoxNews.com.\n\nPennie added that any money he is awarded from the lawsuit \u2013 or a similar one he has filed against Black Lives Matter - would go directly to his foundation.\n\nThe question of whether or not Hamas' social media feeds had any influence on Johnson \u2013 either directly or indirectly \u2013 is something that the federal court will have to decide, but what is not in question is the frequency that companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google have been hit with lawsuits from survivors or families of the victims of domestic and international terror attacks.\n\n\"There seems to be a spate of these cases recently and it's probably because there have been recently a spate of these tragedies,\" Matt Bartholomew, a professor at the University of Buffalo School of Law, told FoxNews.com.\n\nHamas, along with terror groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, maintain an active presence on both Facebook and Twitter as a way to recruit and radicalize followers and also rely heavily on the Google-owned YouTube to post propaganda, press releases and even executions.\n\nAt the heart of Pennie's lawsuit \u2013 and a similar one filed by the families of victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting in June \u2013 is the interpretation of a provision tucked deep inside the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996 called Section 230.\n\nThe language of Section 230 states that \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" In layman's terms, this basically means that sites like Facebook or YouTube are not liable for what their users post on their sites.\n\nSection 230 of the CDA has protected social media sites in the past, but some lawyers and social media experts have begun to argue sites like Facebook may be violating the provision with their heavily-guarded algorithms. Despite these algorithms having come under fire before \u2013 from how Facebook curated its Trending Topics to accusations that YouTube was censoring people \u2013 these recent lawsuits allege something much more nefarious behind one of the tech world's most secretive processes.\n\n\"There are so many questions that need be answered by these social media companies,\" Eric Feinberg of the cyber security and intelligence firm GIPEC told FoxNews.com. \"How good are they at vetting their content? Why aren't they sharing this information with law enforcement? They need to either fix these problems internally or hire a third party to do it for them.\"\n\nFacebook and Twitter argue that they are doing everything they can to prevent terror groups from using their sites, but experts contend the companies are caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to the issue as the web giants have voiced willingness to aid in the fight but have been less than transparent when it comes to sharing proprietary information like their algorithms.\n\nWhen asked to comment on this story, a representative from Twitter emailed FoxNews.com the company's policy prohibiting the promotion of terrorism. A spokesperson from Facebook said the company is \"committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook.\"\n\n\"Our Community Standards make clear that there is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it's reported to us,\" the spokesperson said in an email to FoxNews.com.\n\nA spokesman for Google cited a statement last month saying that Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and You Tube were coming together to curb the spread of terrorist content. This included creating a shared industry database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" related to terrorism.\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg also sat down with the Dallas Police Department Monday night to discuss the role of social media and how it's changing the dynamics of law enforcement following the mass shooting.\n\nExperts say, however, that until a judge sides with the plaintiffs in one of these cases, social media companies will not have to pay a dime, but they also warn that should the interpretation of Section 230 change, there could be a windfall of lawsuits against these companies.\n\n\"We're now seeing some of these cases all at once but until a court says under Section 230 these companies are liable then nothing will happen,\" Bartholomew said. \"But once there is a chink in the armor, there will be an avalanche.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.14866018295288, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1015, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.3693144875300005, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 9, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 44, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.33497536945813, "mft_mean": 4.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/11/08/stanford-uses-crispr-to-correct-sickle-cell-human-trials-planned.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [75]}}, "headline": "Stanford uses CRISPR to correct sickle cell, human trials planned", "wordcount_as_scraped": 617, "date": "20161108140000", "story_content": "CHICAGO \u2013 \u00a0Scientists at Stanford University School of Medicine have used the CRISPR gene editing tool to repair the gene that causes sickle cell disease in stem cells from diseased patients, paving the way for a potential cure for the disease, which affects up to 5 million people globally.\n\n\"What we've finally shown is that we can do it. It's not just on the chalkboard,\" said Dr. Matthew Porteus, senior author of the study published in the journal Nature.\n\nWith the study, and unpublished findings from his lab, Porteus believes his team has amassed enough proof to start planning the first human clinical trial using the powerful CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system to correct the genetic mutation that causes sickle cell disease.\n\n\"We think we have a complete data set to present to the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to say we've done all pre-clinical experiments to show this is ready for a clinical trial,\" Porteus told Reuters by phone.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 has quickly become the preferred method of gene editing in research labs because of its ease of use compared with older techniques.\n\nCRISPR works as a type of molecular scissors that can selectively trim away unwanted parts of the genome, and replace it with new stretches of DNA.\n\nResearch using the powerful technique is plowing ahead even as researchers from the University of California and the Broad Institute battle for control over the CRISPR patent. Oral arguments in the case are expected on Dec. 6 at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Alexandria, Va.\n\nIn sickle cell disease, the body makes mutant, sickle-shaped hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. It is caused by a single mutation in a gene that makes a hemoglobin protein.\n\nIn a study published last month in Science Translational Medicine, a team from the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues used the CRISPR gene editing tool to snip out the diseased gene and deliver a new stretch of DNA to correct the mutation in human stem cells.\n\nIn that study, some 25 percent of blood-forming cells were corrected.\n\nIn the Stanford study, Porteus and colleagues took a different approach. They used CRISPR to snip the gene, but they used a harmless virus to introduce the repair mechanism into cells.\n\nAfter a series of tests in healthy cells, the team tested the gene editing system in blood-forming cells from four patients with sickle cell disease. They showed they could correct the mutation in 30 to 50 percent of these diseased cells.\n\nSixteen weeks after they injected the cells into young mice, the team found the cells were still thriving in the bone marrow.\n\nPorteus said the findings were very encouraging because prior studies have shown that if you can correct mutations in 10 percent of cells, that should create enough to cure the disease.\n\nStanford is now scaling up its laboratory processes to support human trials.\n\nThe process will involve using chemotherapy to wipe out a patient's blood system but not their immune system, as is done in a stem cell transplant.\n\nThen, the team would inject the patient's own corrected stem cells, which the researchers hope would engraft into the bone marrow and produce healthy blood cells.\n\nPorteus has equity interest in CRISPR Therapeutics of Cambridge, Massachusetts, but he said the sickle cell work has been independent of it. The university has built a cell manufacturing plant for this purpose.\n\n\"We hope to develop the entire process here at Stanford,\" he said.\n\nPorteus said the team plans to make an initial submission to the FDA in the next few months to map out the clinical trial, and hopes to treat the first patient in 2018.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.52905201911926, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 615, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.54181672611, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 15, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161108140000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 5.2032520325203295, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/11/bret-baier-after-obama-says-farewell-looking-to-eisenhower-for-wisdom-from-past.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [99, 109, 115, 166, 185, 220, 291, 324, 353, 692, 695, 700, 809, 843, 879, 886, 902, 915, 923, 931, 1070, 1143, 1210, 1271, 1322, 1369, 1382, 1400, 1586, 1627, 1663, 1681, 1751, 1794, 1817, 1957, 2032, 2056, 2099, 2251, 2412, 2422, 2449, 2540, 2561, 2585, 2602, 2615, 2620, 2629, 2644, 2665, 2713, 2737, 2741, 3055, 3081, 3100, 3117, 3170, 3274, 3339, 3402, 3445, 3528, 3548, 3669, 3683, 3691, 3808, 3910, 3918, 3954, 3958, 3982, 4031, 4046, 4063, 4073, 4089, 4130, 4246, 4286, 4373, 4500, 4561, 4631, 4666, 4673, 4710, 4733, 4855, 4861, 4895, 4968, 4979, 5300, 5389, 5400, 5410, 5494, 5579, 5593, 5685, 5694, 5705, 5719, 5776, 5781, 5793, 5797, 5816, 5848, 5861, 5869, 5961, 6050, 6059, 6068, 6070, 6097, 6102, 6118, 6137, 6177, 6433, 6443, 6490, 6544, 6602, 6618, 6692, 6723, 6814, 6830, 6940, 7134, 7233, 7342, 7775, 7880]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1217, "scraper_regex": 1284}}, "headline": "Bret Baier: After Obama says farewell-- looking to Eisenhower for wisdom from the past", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1284, "date": "20170111170000", "story_content": "Tuesday night\u00a0President\u00a0Obama\u00a0delivered his farewell to the nation, choosing the\u00a0McCormick Place in\u00a0his Chicago hometown as the stage.\u00a0\n\nThe dramatic setting, the enormous crowd and the almost concert-like\u00a0optics set this apart from every\u00a0other presidential farewell.\u00a0With echoes of past speeches and playing off the themes of the hope and change campaign of 2008, the speech was part emotional goodbye and part pep talk for his party -- after Democrats were decisively defeated in an election Obama repeatedly said was meant to secure his legacy.\n\nIn his address, President Obama defended that legacy, but\u00a0he\u00a0also\u00a0sought to reach beyond parties and disappointments to give the American people his idea about a way forward.\u00a0\n\nThe speech had special interest\u00a0for me beyond the current political\u00a0scene.\u00a0I was listening\u00a0particularly\u00a0closely\u00a0because\u00a0my new book on Dwight Eisenhower, \"Three Days in January: Dwight Eisenhower's Final Mission,\" is built around his iconic farewell address,\u00a0delivered on January 17, 1961. Serendipitously, the book launched on the\u00a0day of President Obama's farewell speech.\n\nIt was that research on\u00a0Eisenhower\u2014and particularly the final days of his transition\u00a0leading up to John F. Kennedy's inauguration--that\u00a0first got me thinking about the meaning of the\u00a0presidential\u00a0farewell address.\u00a0What is its purpose for presidents then and now?\n\nEisenhower was a great student of George Washington whose dramatic farewell in 1796 is worth our attention. That transition in 1796 was\u00a0a critical moment of truth for our young\u00a0nation, which had yet to experience\u00a0what would become\u00a0one of its most precious traditions\u2014the peaceful transition of power.\u00a0\n\nIt had literally never been done before.\u00a0Washington's farewell,\u00a0printed and distributed in a newspaper article, was the decisive moment when the nation learned he would not seek a third term, but rather,\u00a0would pass the baton and step aside.\n\nWith great humility, the man who had\u00a0been at the helm of our\u00a0government through its first years, wrote,\u00a0\"Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment.\"\u00a0\n\nIn other words, he was communicating that the presidency was not about the man but the office, and it was the Constitution that would see the country through.\u00a0Still, he\u00a0went on to give a forceful\u00a0defense of the principles upon which the country was founded, and a strong warning against\u00a0foreign intervention\u00a0and for national unity.\u00a0\n\nAs evidence of\u00a0the power of\u00a0this\u00a0enduring\u00a0message, every\u00a0year in February, in\u00a0honor of Washington's birthday, the U.S. Senate\u00a0reads aloud the text of\u00a0his\u00a0farewell address\u2014a tradition that has been observed since 1896. Clearly, he set the mold.\n\nPresident Obama made a point of referencing Washington's farewell in his own speech Tuesday, particularly his warning that self-government is the foundation of our nation and we must guard it always with \"jealous anxiety.\"\u00a0\n\nArguably, Eisenhower is\u00a0the only president\u00a0since Washington\u00a0whose farewell words have made a lasting impression.\u00a0In saying goodbye, American presidents typically attempt to accomplish two things: defend their records\u00a0and look ahead to the challenges facing the nation. The speeches\u00a0are rarely memorable, and that is one reason Ike's stands out.\u00a0\n\nThree presidents in our modern era never\u00a0had the opportunity to give farewells. Roosevelt and Kennedy died in office. Nixon\u00a0gave a hasty speech\u00a0that was more of a personal goodbye as he prepared to escape the shame of his resignation. With other modern presidents,\u00a0the farewells\u00a0seem to\u00a0reflect the men themselves. Some of them were crafted in the twilight of disappointing terms. Lyndon Johnson recited\u00a0a catalog of accomplishments delivered not as a separate farewell but in his final state of the union\u00a0address\u00a0before congress. His lengthy speech\u00a0was\u00a0ponderous and tortured.\u00a0Carter, still resentful about being defeated for\u00a0a second term,\u00a0was somber while\u00a0detailing\u00a0America's ills.\u00a0\n\nReagan's farewell isn't as memorable. \u00a0But reading it, one is often struck by how perfectly it reflected the man with all his warmth and personal feeling.\u00a0Speaking from the Oval Office, he said,\u00a0\"People ask how I feel about leaving. And the fact is, 'parting is such sweet sorrow.'\u00a0The sweet part is California and the ranch and freedom. The sorrow\u2014the goodbyes, of course, and leaving this beautiful place.\"\u00a0He went on to tell story after story in his masterful style.\u00a0Rather than a policy checklist Reagan chose to speak of higher ideals\u00a0and call for patriotic engagement.\u00a0\n\nBill\u00a0Clinton and George W. Bush both said\u00a0in their speeches that\u00a0they were more optimistic about America than when they began their presidencies\u2014a striking statement for Bush in light of\u00a0\u202a9/11\u00a0and the ensuing war on terrorism.\u00a0\n\nPresident Obama's farewell came at the end of an acrimonious election,\u00a0addressing\u00a0a nation that is deeply divided. In the soaring oratory that is his trademark, he called on the nation to lace up its shoes and get to work, saying, \"The long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion.\" While taking veiled swipes at the incoming Trump administration whose agenda is starkly different than his,\u00a0he covered little new ground, mostly repeating his standard theme of hope, and declaring\u00a0as his two\u00a0immediate\u00a0predecessors had that he was more optimistic than ever about the future of America.\u00a0\n\nWatching this speech, it seems clearer than ever that Dwight Eisenhower's farewell\u00a0stands out as\u00a0the most important of our era\u2014and possibly the most significant address since Washington's.\u00a0Notably,\u00a0the speech\u00a0only received\u00a0cursory attention at the time. The country and the media\u00a0were\u00a0swept up in\u00a0the\u00a0excitement about a\u00a0glamorous president-to-be. Only\u00a0later, after\u00a0Kennedy\u00a0was mired in problems, and then Johnson was burdened with the trials of Vietnam, did people\u00a0begin to take a new look at Eisenhower's words.\n\nEisenhower gave the speech not before a\u00a0cheering\u00a0crowd or\u00a0a\u00a0congressional chamber, but\u00a0in a\u00a0black-and-white\u00a0televised address,\u00a0sitting at his desk in the Oval Office.\u00a0The speech was not an afterthought. In fact, it had been a year and a half in the making, a serious effort involving some thirty drafts. At the Eisenhower Library, you can hold the original drafts of the speech with gloved hands, and see Eisenhower's many\u00a0scribbled\u00a0notations in his effort to get it just right. \u00a0In the end, although Ike was speaking to the country,\u00a0he was also addressing an audience of one\u2014president-elect\u00a0Kennedy. He was\u00a0determined to pass on to this eager young man the importance of balancing\u00a0the interests of the nation, a\u00a0caution about the dangers of an untamed military-industrial complex, and the importance of\u00a0bipartisanship.\u00a0\n\nIn many ways Eisenhower's farewell still speaks to our times. The themes are a template for the modern era.\u00a0We still struggle with that delicate balancing act, while we face new questions about our place in the world.\n\nEisenhower's address survives because it wasn't about him and his accomplishments.\u00a0It wasn't soaring or poetic, just the plainspoken talk of a man giving a warning and a reminder of\u00a0who we are as a nation and what we need to do to protect our sacred democracy.\n\nAs he said quite simply\u2014and,\u00a0like President Washington \u2014\"You and I, my fellow citizens, need to be strong in our faith that all nations, under God, will reach the goal of peace with justice. May we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle, confident but humble with power, diligent in pursuit of the nation's great goals.\"\n\n\n\nBret Baier is the Chief Political Anchor of Fox News Channel, and the Anchor & Executive Editor of \"Special Report with Bret Baier.\"\u00a0 His book, \"Three Days in January: Dwight Eisenhower's Final Mission,\" (William Morrow) is on sale now. \u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 24, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.7107320427894591, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1217, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.68537320395, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 42, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.4511092851273597, "mft_mean": 3.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/22/senate-democrats-press-trumps-wealthy-picks-for-financial-data.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [77]}}, "headline": "Senate Democrats press Trump's wealthy picks for financial data", "wordcount_as_scraped": 686, "date": "20161222230000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON  \u2013 \u00a0Top Senate Democrats are trying to put the brakes on President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks, insisting on extensive financial information on some of the wealthiest Americans before moving forward on nominations.\n\nFrustrated by the slow response of billionaires and multimillionaires to their request, 16 Democrats delivered an ultimatum Thursday, saying no committee should vote on a nominee until the individual has cleared an FBI background check, provided a financial report and an ethics agreement with the Office of Government Ethics, and responded to \"reasonable requests for additional information\" such as tax returns.\n\n\"The United States Senate has a rich, bipartisan tradition of vetting nominees to the president's Cabinet,\" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Democratic leader. \"We hope to continue that tradition with our colleagues in the Republican majority because the American people are entitled to a fair and open consideration process for all executive nominations.\"\n\nRepublicans controlling the Senate, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, want to make quick work of Cabinet confirmations once Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\nDemocrats have limited options to block nominees outright because they changed filibuster rules when they controlled the Senate in 2013, and Cabinet nominees can win approval on a simple majority vote. Republicans will hold a 52-48 advantage next year. However, Democrats could drag out the process in committee or force longer Senate debates than usual.\n\n\"President-elect Trump refused to release his tax returns and will start his presidency consumed by questions about how he could be using his position to enrich himself and his family, but that doesn't mean that his nominees should be held to the same low standards,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.\n\nTransition officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nTrump's choice of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state touched off an escalating fight Thursday between the top Republican and Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, the panel that will vote on the multimillionaire's nomination.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, the committee chairman, complained that Democrats are asking for disclosures not demanded of previous nominees, including wealthy people like Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\n\"This is being driven by the election,\" Corker, R-Tenn., told The Associated Press. \"The fact that Donald Trump did not provide tax returns is driving all that is being done.\"\n\nIn fact, Kerry, a former Massachusetts senator, had to file an annual financial disclosure report, and he released 20 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 2004.\n\nIn a letter to colleagues, Sen. Ben Cardin, the panel's top Democrat, said he asked the Trump transition team for three years' worth of tax returns because Tillerson was \"actively engaged with many foreign governments\" at Exxon Mobil. Cardin said Tillerson \"promised to provide\" the tax information in response to a question on a standard questionnaire that all nominees submit prior to appearing before the committee.\n\n\"Senator Corker and I have a disagreement about the need to review the nominee's tax returns,\" Cardin said. \"I think it is an important part of vetting this candidate because he has never made public disclosures of this type, as he has worked at Exxon Mobil for his entire career and has never been in public service.\"\n\nCorker quickly responded with a statement saying the GOP-controlled committee never officially asked for the tax returns and insisted that Tillerson was ahead of schedule in providing information to the committee.\n\nThe issue has the potential to produce a major political battle in the opening days of Trump's administration. In addition to Tillerson, Trump has tapped Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive, for treasury secretary, and Betsy DeVos, daughter of the Amway co-founder, for education secretary.\n\nCorker said it is not the practice of his committee to request tax information.\n\n\"We're going to operate exactly the same way that we've been operating the 10 years that I've been on the committee,\" Corker added. \"We've never asked for tax returns. It's not what we do on our committee.\"\n\nCorker said the committee's own financial disclosure forms \"are very expansive.

In July, the federal office that oversees research on human subjects recommended that data sharing be the rule, not the exception.\n\nAnd many of the million people expected to sign up for the big federal research project known as the Precision Medicine Initiative will get access to everything scientists learn about them, including DNA readouts and data on the billions of bacteria living in their guts.\n\n\"It's a power shift,\" said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute.\n\nBut it remains to be seen how the average volunteer will make use of the information \u2014 or if they will even want to see it.\n\nRead more: New federal rules target woeful public reporting of clinical trial results\n\nIn two clinical trials for diabetes in 2013, Pfizer enabled US volunteers to set up online accounts where they could download data such as heart rhythm charts, lab reports, and vital sign measurements after the study's end. Less than 15 percent did so.\n\n\"What we found is patients expressing that they wanted access, but not a high volume of clicks for access,\" said Craig Lipset, head of clinical innovation at Pfizer. \"I'm not sure they felt there were enough things to do with the data that were truly meaningful.\"\n\nLipset suspected the company can boost interest by tweaking\u00a0when and how volunteers get the data, and what they learn.\n\nJanssen Pharmaceutical is now trying out something similar with a study of an experimental drug for rheumatoid arthritis. Volunteers can get real-time lab data and upload it into their own electronic medical records. At participating study sites, 24 percent of volunteers opted in \u2014 and 38 percent of them used the system regularly.\n\nIt's a minority, admitted Dr. Andreas Koester, a vice president of research and development operations at Janssen. But he's not deterred: The aim was to get feedback on making such a system easier to use.\n\n\"The message from industry is: 'This is a black box. You give us everything, and we can't tell you anything, and that's just the way it is,'\" Koester said. \"This is not sustainable.\"\n\nProponents make the case that returning data to volunteers could improve public trust in research and increase participation in studies. It might also reduce duplicate medical tests, help participants manage their own health, and encourage more data sharing between scientists.\n\nJack Whelan, 67, has less abstract goals\u00a0in mind: He considers access to his own data\u00a0crucial to his survival.\n\nIn the past eight years, he has joined seven clinical trials of drugs for his blood cancer. This month he's starting his eighth, for a new diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer.\n\nRight from the start of his first trial, Whelan told the study doctor: I want that data you're collecting. He plugged it into a spreadsheet, and tracked his body's response to each experimental drug. Although Whelan doesn't have a background in medicine, as a former research analyst, he's good with data.\n\nHe quickly learned to figure out whether an experimental drug was effective or not, just by observing changes in creatinine, bilirubin, and other factors in his blood. Participants in clinical trials aren't supposed to know whether a drug is working. But the way Whelan\u00a0saw it, he couldn't afford not to know. \"If after two or three [drug] infusions, I could see that it wasn't going the right way, I'd say: 'I want to stop the trial, I want to get off this bus,'\" he said.\n\nRead more: For cancer patients, newest treatments force the ultimate decision, with no room for error\n\nSuch stories make researchers wary; it can hurt the reliability of clinical trials if volunteers drop out when they think a drug isn't working. That matters to Whelan, too, but he's understandably more worried about his own life. He's convinced that\u00a0analyzing his data is what's kept him alive so long with such a deadly disease.\n\nTo help others do the same, Whelan and collaborators built an app and information service for patients to manage their health records (including clinical trial data, if they can get it). The team sold it to the clinical trial software company ERT, which is integrating it with its own system. (Whelan, who lives in Andover, Mass., also gets speaking fees from various drug companies as a patient representative.)\n\nOthers argue that giving volunteers their data is just the right thing to do. \"You're asking me to spend time, to literally devote my body and possibly compromise my health to help advance a therapy, and yet I tend to be the invisible partner,\" said Laura Kolaczkowski, 62, a patient advocate in Ohio\u00a0who is now\u00a0the\u00a0co-principal investigator for iConquerMS, which lets\u00a0people with multiple sclerosis share their data for research.\n\nKolaczkowski volunteered for a study of baclofen, a muscle relaxant, but was never even told whether the trial succeeded or failed. \"At the end of the day, when that study concludes,\" she said, \"the people who've participated are owed that by the sponsors.\"\n\nIn the US, federal rules don't forbid giving volunteers their test results, as long as the tests are well-established as legitimate.\n\nIn fact, the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections at the Department of Health and Human Services recently recommended a \"rebuttable presumption\" in favor of returning individual results after a study is over, at least for conventional tests like viral loads for hepatitis \u2014 or even IQ. The information doesn't need to be medically important. Pure intellectual curiosity is reason enough, the guidance says.\n\nAccess to data is usually written into study protocols and spelled out in the paperwork that participants sign. It just typically doesn't happen.\n\nOnly 9 percent of research volunteers surveyed in 2014 got even so much as a summary of the study results. Just 4 percent found out whether they got an active drug or a placebo, according to the survey of 1,072 volunteers by the nonprofit Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation.\n\nRead more: 'Game of Genomes' Season 1: An epic quest to crack the mysteries of our DNA\n\nSome scientists \u2014 and even some study volunteers \u2014 support keeping clinical trial participants partly or largely in the dark.\n\n\"I used to think patients need all data, but that's not what I believe nowadays,\" said breast cancer survivor Deborah Collyar, president of Patient Advocates in Research and a member of many research advisory committees. \"Data is not knowledge. You need to understand the data, and then be able to interpret it.\"\n\nWithout proper context, she said, the information isn't useful.\n\nAnother concern: Giving volunteers their data sets up the expectation that they'll get something valuable for participating in a clinical trial, rather than agreeing to do it purely out of altruism, said Dr. Eileen Clayton, a professor at Vanderbilt University's Center for Biomedical Ethics and Society. The practice blurs the lines between research and health care, she said. It's a poor use of limited research funds. And volunteers might misinterpret test results and seek unnecessary treatments or further tests.\n\nSo Clayton argues for strict limits on data return: Research participants should get only results that uncover a potentially serious condition, like a suspicious shadow on an MRI.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, some researchers are trying to make it easier for study participants to get broad access to their data \u2014 and then share it, if they'd like, with scientists.\n\nOne recent project\u00a0lets\u00a0families with rare undiagnosed genetic diseases\u00a0join a research study through the University of Washington Center for Mendelian Genomics. They get their genomes sequenced and receive the raw data \u2014 along with a report and tools to explore it \u2014 for just $825, instead of the $5,000 to $7,000 it could cost through a doctor. If they choose, they can publicly share that data, along with\u00a0their own medical records.\n\nPutting data directly into people's hands is step toward reengineering the system. The goal is a research process that's faster, more equitable, and more squarely aimed at curing disease, said Jason Bobe, an associate professor of genetics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\nAcademic researchers, companies, and nonprofits have incentives to keep data locked up, whether to protect intellectual property, grants, or publications, Bobe pointed out. Study volunteers are mostly in it just to improve their own health or further\u00a0medical science.\n\n\"They don't care as much about tenure, stock price, those kinds of things,\" Bobe said. \"They care about outcomes \u2014 their health and the health of their family.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.364963501691818, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1417, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.83176742542, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4820042342978101, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/01/rush-to-regulate-obama-steps-on-gas-with-costly-rules.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [712, 916, 1111, 1291, 1707, 2609, 2690, 2920, 5748, 6792, 8211, 8547, 8562, 8581, 8611]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1233, "scraper_regex": 1297}}, "headline": " Obama races to impose tougher greenhouse gas rules, and much more ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1297, "date": "20161201210000", "story_content": "The Obama administration is introducing a last-minute barrage of costly environmental regulation pronouncements that Republicans have vowed to repeal as soon as possible after Donald Trump's January 20 presidential inauguration.\n\nThe recent outpouring adds to the administration's dubious record of producing more than 600 major regulations -- those estimated to cost more than $100 million each -- during its tenure, according to a study by the American Action Forum, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nCase in point: an announcement by the Environmental Protection Agency, one of the administration's most energetic rule-makers, on Wednesday that\u00a0 after lengthy study, it would push ahead with tougher greenhouse gas emission standards, equivalent to 54.1 miles per gallon fuel efficiency, for passenger cars and light trucks for the years 2022-2025.\u00a0\n\nEPA says the standards will prevent emission of some 6 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases over the vehicles' life span. Technically speaking, EPA's administrator has until April 18, 2017,\u00a0 to make a so-called \"final determination\" about the rules -- but is doing it sooner, the agency says, for reasons of \"long-term regulatory certainty and stability.\"\n\nTranslation:\u00a0EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy is certain to be out of the job by then, and the ruling will likely hit a brick wall in a much more climate-skeptical Trump administration.\n\nThe public has until December 30 -- three weeks before Inauguration Day -- to comment on the move.\n\nWithin hours, the EPA announcement was decried by Sen, Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, as \u00a0\"another administrative avenue for President Obama to force his climate ideologies on American businesses and consumers,\" through a fuel economy program that is \"broken and rife with inequalities.\"\n\nInhofe said he looked forward \"to working in the next Congress with the new administration to pare back all of the legacy-saving regulatory actions this administration will continue to advance as their January 20 deadline approaches.\"\n\nInhofe's legacy-saving jibe was apt enough: the fuel economy final determination makes explicit reference to the Paris climate agreement signed by the U.S. and more than 190 other countries, which also came into force this month -- and from which President-elect Trump vowed on the campaign trail to withdraw (Trump has since declared he is \"keeping an open mind\" about the document.)\n\nMoreover, the determination, while it makes no additional regulations post-2025,\u00a0makes the case for further emissions reductions, averaging 4.3 percent annually,\u00a0for the following quarter-century in order to meet the long-term goals of the Paris agreement.\n\nCars and trucks are hardly the only products to get the eleventh-hour regulatory treatment from EPA and other agencies, in the waning\u00a0months of the administration.\n\nIn August, EPA and the Department of Transportation finalized additional follow-on standards through 2027 for emissions from medium- and heavy-duty trucks and other vehicles that the agencies said would save 1.1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, even while they pushed up the price of big trucks by some $14,000 by some estimates.\n\nTransportation Secretary Anthony Foxx called the new rules \"a huge win for the American people.\" The estimated cost of the regulation, according to American Action Forum, is about $29.3 billion.\n\nThe EPA's first-ever regulations covering methane emissions from the oil and gas industry were finalized in May, and significantly toughened from an earlier version. They are now the focus of a court battle led by the state of Texas, which called the tough emission standards a \"gross demonstration of federal over-reach.\"\n\nMeantime, the most expansive -- and expensive -- regulatory change of all, the administration's Clean Power Plan, which aims to reorganize much of the nation's entire electrical generating system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has been stayed by the Supreme Court while an appeals court rules on its legality.\n\nBut there is much more. In all, estimates run to nearly 100 new rules that could still emerge from administration agencies before power passes to the Trump administration; earlier this month, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy officially warned federal agencies not to finalize any more rules and regulations before inauguration.\n\nAs the latest passenger car and truck determination shows, the message hasn't exactly gotten through. Republicans have further threatened to use the Congressional Review Act starting in January to repeal any regulation the Obama administration finalized after May 30, but that too could prove to be more work than they realize -- with the administration's final rule-making binge as the ultimate tsunami.\n\nThe biggest single force behind the latest upwelling of gas rules is the goals that the Obama administration set to cut U.S. greenhouse emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and 26 to 28 percent by 2030 -- long after the administration departs.\n\nIn its second biennial report on progress toward those goals, presented earlier this month, at a follow-on to the United Nations-sponsored Paris climate agreement meeting in Marrakech, the Administration announced that \"factoring in all of our planned additional measures, including measures that have been proposed by not yet finalized,\" the U.S. was \"on track\" to hit the 17 percent figure.\n\nThe \"additional measures also have the potential to drive our emissions down to 22-27 percent below 2005 levels by 2025\" -- tantalizingly close to the draconian stretch goal.\n\nAmong the areas where the additional gains could come:\u00a0changes in U.S. land-use and forestry; new standards for equipment and appliance efficiency, tougher building standards for energy efficiency, and even greater adoption of biofuels.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT\n\nThe administration also has been seeking to lock in its efforts internationally, through new multilateral agreements and integrated greenhouse reduction plans with neighboring Canada and Mexico.\n\nAs part of a 20-nation effort called Mission Innovation, the administration announced, among other things, that it hoped to double U.S. spending on clean-energy research and development to some $12.8 billion by 2021 -- even though the Obama team will be long gone.\n\nA billionaires' club of tycoons, including Bill Gates and George Soros, also have been enlisted in the effort, to mobilize billions more in private-sector financing for the clean-energy effort.\n\nA shower of additional \"clean\" transportation and infrastructure projects were further included in the Obama administration's proposed 2017 budget, ranging from\u00a0the start of a $7 billion annual spend on advanced rail technology to $750 million more toward a promised $3 billion for the U.N.-sponsored Green Climate Fund, which Congress has already opposed without success.\n\nAn administration spokesperson underlined to Fox News that \"clean energy R and D has enjoyed bipartisan support during a number of administrations and across sectors.\" The official pointed to a Senate Appropriations Committee endorsement last April of more than $37 billion in energy and water development funding.\"\n\nThe Obama budget is now a dead letter, in the process of being replaced by short-term financing for the federal government through the early months of next year.\n\nRepublican legislators have vowed that the short-term fix will itself be a \"clean\" project -- that is, not festooned with special interest deals and boondoggles, or any of the huge laundry list of projects contained in the still-born budget.\n\nThey could even succeed. But the real challenge may come in the mountain of infrastructure spending that President-elect Trump and the opposition Democrats seem to agree is needed to jump-start American economic growth in 2017 and the years ahead.\n\nA mammoth wave of spending, after all, is how the Obama administration launched itself in the first place on its path to a legacy that the victorious Republicans now say they deplore.\n\nThe administration spokesperson put it this way:\u00a0\"While we can't speak to what the future administration may or may not do, investing in clean energy R & D to increase U.S. competitiveness, strengthen infrastructure and enhance national security remains an important priority for the Obama administration.\"\n\nGeorge Russell is Editor-at-Large of Fox News.

But the confusion among officials at national security agencies could have consequences, given their international engagements. The rest of the world doesn't pause while Washington determines its chains of command.\n\n\nWork will likely helm the Defense Department for only a matter of hours.

Obama's special envoy for Syria, Michael Ratney, has indicated he is willing to attend, but the transition team hadn't instructed him to make the trip. Spicer said an announcement was expected soon.\n\n\nAs in previous transitions, U.S. embassies and consulates abroad headed by noncareer, presidential appointee ambassadors will transfer to the most senior career diplomat present until the new administration fills the top posts.\n\n\nThe transition team has largely yielded on matters of national security to retired Gen.

David Thompson said.\n\nThe suspect, James Tylka, 30, was seen driving away and officers pursued him, police said. The chase ended with an exchange of gunfire about 20 miles south of Portland.\n\nAuthorities did not release other information about the chase and shootout, except that officers from three police departments were involved and have been placed on paid administrative leave, a routine move.\n\nBut details emerged about Tylka's problems at home. He was locked in a protracted dispute with his former wife over custody of their son and child support payments, according to court records.\n\nSocial media and court records indicate he was married to Kate Armand and that the couple had a baby girl.\n\nTylka posted a photo on Facebook early this month of the couple kissing in happier times and commented: \"We aren't divorced.\" Someone responded that she hoped they work things out.\n\nPolice have not released the name of the woman he is believed to have killed, but Megan Armand told media outlets that the victim was her sister, Kate.\n\n\"We are still in shock and devastated from last night's events,\" she said in a statement. \"My heart is broken from the loss of my only sister. Our thoughts and prayers are also with the wounded OSP Officer and his family.\"\n\nSeveral Facebook posts by Kate Armand's friends expressed grief, describing her as a good person and an amazing mother to the nearly 1-year-old girl.\n\nTylka updated his Facebook profile photo shortly before his death, displaying a picture of the couple. He also updated his cover photo, showing his two children, a boy and a baby daughter.\n\nTylka's ex-wife, Sabrina Starks, had filed for immediate temporary custody of their son in September, saying the boy was in danger of potential abuse. She said Tylka spoke about suicide in September 2015, drawing a call to police, before leaving town for four months.\n\nStarks wrote in the custody request that they agreed to joint custody in May 2016 but he had been acting irrationally, impulsively and aggressively, constantly pressuring the boy for updates about what she was doing.\n\nShe said the boy was crying when she picked him up on Sept. 5 and that he told her Tylka yelled at him and a grandmother.\n\n\"I asked him what he meant. (The boy) stated, 'If I don't tell Daddy what you do, he yells at me and sends me to the corner. I told him no, and he yells until I tell him,'\" she wrote.\n\nA judge denied Starks' request for immediate temporary custody. They divorced in April 2011, court records say, but it's not clear when Tylka married Kate Armand. Starks mentioned the marriage in her custody request, however.\n\nMike Rowe, a spokesman for the police department in nearby city of Beaverton, said Tylka was a cadet there between 2004 and 2006. Rowe said he does not know why Tylka left the program.\n\nEarlier this month, an auto dealer filed a small claim against Tylka, saying he owes $450 for a down payment of a vehicle.\n\n____\n\nFollow Steven DuBois at twitter.com/pdxdub\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.96894407272339, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 579, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.7059774665700003, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.10880829015544, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/12/latest-thousands-protest-trump-in-los-angeles.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [67]}}, "headline": "The Latest: Thousands protest Trump in Los Angeles", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1192, "date": "20161112220000", "story_content": "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2013 \u00a0The Latest on nationwide and international protests against President-elect Donald Trump (all times PST):\n\n1:25 p.m.\n\nSeveral thousand anti-Trump protesters are marching in downtown Los Angeles, denouncing his campaign pledge to deport people who entered the U.S. illegally and his crude comments about women.\n\nCheers, chants and flag-waving mark Saturday's procession, which stretches for blocks through the Civic Center.\n\nNo arrests have been made even though the train of demonstrators occasionally snarled traffic.\n\nThe mood seemed enthusiastic rather than angry.

She thought some basic survival skills would be helpful if Russian troops ever entered Vilnius and her family escaped into the woods.\n\n\"Russia is a very dangerous kind of neighbor,\" said Miskinyte, a 53-year-old film producer. \"They are always aiming at us.\"\n\nAcross Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, fears are intensifying that Moscow, after displaying its military might in Georgia, Ukraine and now Syria, could have the Baltic states in its sights next. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned he wouldn't hesitate to defend Russians wherever they live \u2014 words that feel like threats since significant numbers of ethnic Russians live in the Baltics.\n\nWhether the danger is real or just bluster remains to be seen. But in Lithuania, a country that experienced a Russian occupation before, some people aren't waiting to find out.\n\nYoung Lithuanian civilians are learning counterinsurgency tactics on weekends. Others, like Miskinyte, have taken steps to protect themselves. The government, in response to pleas from a fearful public, has issued a preparation manual.\n\nRimvydas Matuzonis directs a project that teaches weekend guerrilla warfare courses. He explained the resolve to be ready by citing a popular saying in the forests of Dzukija, the southern region where his father grew up.\n\n\"Spring will come, the cuckoo will sing and we will pave our roads with the corpses of Russian soldiers,\" Matuzonis said.\n\nTo be sure, some in the Baltic states feel reassured by their NATO membership and aren't overly anxious about a pending Russian invasion. Others describe a dull anxiety that flares up only sometimes. But there are some who are truly afraid and already preparing for the worst.\n\nWhen Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, Miskinyte packed a bag with bread, salt and some essential items and planned to flee to a village where she has a house. She urged relatives to join her there, if the Russians came for Lithuania next.\n\n\"In the village you always survive,\" Miskinyte said. \"There is land, there are vegetables. There is everything there.\"\n\nThe sense of vulnerability in much of Eastern Europe has been heightened by a feeling that the international order, which brought peace and economic growth after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is disintegrating. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he might not automatically defend the Baltic states, underlines the shift.\n\nExacerbating the dread lately is Moscow's move to build up troops and nuclear-capable missiles in Kaliningrad, a Russian region wedged between NATO members Lithuania and Poland.\n\nPoland is creating a so-called Territorial Defense Force to train thousands of volunteers for the kind of low-intensity hybrid warfare seen in eastern Ukraine, including cyber warfare. Some of the new volunteers also will be assigned to protect Polish territory near Kaliningrad.\n\nBut the foreboding is no doubt greater in the ex-Soviet republics, whose decision to regain independence when the Soviet empire collapsed humiliated the Kremlin.\n\nIn response to calls for guidance from citizens fearing war, Lithuania's Defense Ministry issued a civilian manual that includes information on survival skills and recognizing Russian weaponry.\n\nThe best way to prevent war is to \"demonstrate to the aggressor that we are ready to fight for our freedom, for every centimeter of our land,\" Defense Minister Juozas Olekas said.\n\n\"The capabilities, the readiness \u2014 this is the only way to stop Russian aggression in the region,\" Olekas said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nLithuania re-established a conscript army last year, but so many citizens have volunteered for military duty that a draft hasn't been necessary. Many civilians in the hugely patriotic nation of 3 million people also remain eager to do their part.\n\nLast weekend, in an area of pine woods and fields outside Vilnius, a group of young men donned military fatigues, loaded pellets into replica assault rifles and practiced counterinsurgency tactics.\n\nUsing armored vehicles and other retired military equipment, they engaged in a mock battle, storming a position held by the enemy amid explosions and thick smoke. Target practice with real weapons followed.\n\nMany of the young civilians say military exercises have been a hobby for years, a way to get outdoors and release stress after a week in the office. But they also said they want to be ready to defend their homeland.\n\nTheir instructors from Defence Project, a warfare training group, make clear the drills have a new urgency given Russia's assertiveness.\n\n\"We have a border not only with Russia, but also with Belarus, and we should be aware that the little green men might appear from other borders or even from within,\" said Zilvinas Pastarnokas, a 45-year-old retired soldier who helped found Defence Project.\n\nMatuzonis, the group's director, said the will to resist comes naturally for a people that suffered Russian occupation in the past. Partisan warfare against Soviet rule continued for several years after World War II.\n\nMany of the lessons Lithuania's soldiers and civilians are learning now were handed down by post-war partisans, knowledge preserved by the military. Ukrainians fighting pro-Russian rebels have shared new tactics.\n\nFears of stewing Russia aggression have raised questions about the loyalties of the ethnic Russians who live in Lithuania and make up about 6 percent of the population. Many settled there when Lithuania was part of the Soviet Union and remained.\n\nLithuanian officials insist they are full citizens like everyone else and aren't under any suspicion, and ethnic Russians say they have very good interactions with Lithuanians.\n\nYet many Lithuanians fear that if war ever came, ethnic Russians would side with Moscow.\n\n\"The Russians will absolutely be on Putin's side. A few are pro-Lithuanian, but not many,\" said Miskinyte, the film producer who took the survival course.\n\nFor their part, Lithuania's ethnic Russians decry what they call the \"anti-Russian propaganda\" of Lithuanian officials, and many hold pro-Kremlin views.\n\n\"Everything in the Lithuanian press is represented from the one side \u2014 that the Russians are the bad guys, that the Russians are coming, that Putin is always bad,\" complained Roman Nutsubidze, 30, who moved to Lithuania as an infant.\n\nNutsubidze, who lives in the predominantly ethnic Russian town of Visaginas, expressed frustration that the West doesn't see Putin as a good leader who has restored national pride to the Russian people. He said he loves Lithuania, but thinks Putin has no reason to want to seize the Baltic states.\n\n\"I don't see what he has done bad,\" Nutsubidze said. \"I don't actually see it.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.19161653518677, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1070, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.3868974564, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161201110000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 3.3644859813084103, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/02/trump-speaks-directly-with-taiwan-leader-irking-china.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [66]}}, "headline": "Trump speaks directly with Taiwan's leader, irking China", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1139, "date": "20161203060000", "story_content": "BEIJING \u2013 \u00a0In a break with decadeslong diplomatic tradition, President-elect Donald Trump spoke directly with the president of Taiwan, a move that drew an irritated response from China and looked set to cast uncertainty over U.S. policy toward Asia.\n\nIt is perhaps unprecedented for a U.S. president or president-elect to speak directly with a leader of Taiwan, a self-governing island the U.S. broke diplomatic ties with in 1979.\n\nIn first comments apparently to downplay the significance of the call, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Saturday the contact between Taiwan's president and Trump was \"just a small trick by Taiwan\" that he believed would not change U.S. policy toward China, according to Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.\n\n\"The one-China policy is the cornerstone of the healthy development of China-U.S. relations and we hope this political foundation will not be interfered with or damaged,\" Wang was quoted as saying.\n\nWashington has pursued a so-called \"one China\" policy since 1979, when it shifted diplomatic recognition of China from the government in Taiwan to the communist government on the mainland. Under that policy, the U.S. recognizes Beijing as representing China but retains unofficial ties with Taiwan.\n\nA statement from Trump's transition team said he spoke Friday with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who offered her congratulations.\n\n\"During the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties ... between Taiwan and the United States. President-elect Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year,\" the statement said.\n\nTrump tweeted later: \"The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!\"\n\nAbout an hour later, Trump groused about the reaction to the call. \"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe Taiwanese presidential office issued a statement early Saturday saying Trump and Tsai discussed issues affecting Asia and the future of U.S. relations with Taiwan.\n\n\"The (Taiwanese) president is looking forward to strengthening bilateral interactions and contacts as well as setting up closer cooperative relations,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The president also told U.S. President-elect Trump that she hopes the U.S. will continue to support Taiwan's efforts in having more opportunities to participate in and contribute to international affairs in the future,\" Tsai's office said.\n\nIt said the two also \"shared ideas and concepts\" on \"promoting domestic economic development and strengthening national defense\" to improve the lives of ordinary people.\n\nThe White House learned of the conversation after it had taken place, said a senior Obama administration official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive diplomatic relations involved.\n\nChina's embassy in Washington, its foreign ministry in Beijing and Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFriday's call is the starkest example yet of how Trump has flouted diplomatic conventions since he won the Nov. 8 election. He has apparently undertaken calls with foreign leaders without guidance customarily lent by the State Department, which oversees U.S. diplomacy.\n\n\"President-elect Trump is just shooting from the hip, trying to take phone calls of congratulatory messages from leaders around the world without consideration for the implications,\" said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.\n\nGlaser said such a call was \"completely unprecedented\" or at least has never been known publicly. Beijing is expected to respond with a reminder to Trump about commitments the U.S. has made to China on Taiwan, she said.\n\nChina is also likely to be trying to identify whether this signals any intent on the part of Trump to alter longstanding U.S. policy toward Taiwan, Glaser said.\n\n\"They will hope that this is a misstep but I think privately, they will definitely seek to educate this incoming president and ensure that he understands the sensitivity of Taiwan,\" she said.\n\nIn particular, China would want to highlight to the incoming administration the risks involved in any form of signal from the United States that it supports strengthening a relationship with Taiwan under a president that Beijing views as pro-independence, Glaser added.\n\nTrump had just last month had a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping during which Trump's office described him as saying he believed the two would have \"one of the strongest relationships for both countries.\"\n\nTsai was democratically elected in January and took office in May. The traditional independence-leaning policies of her party have strained relations with Beijing.\n\nOver the decades, the status of Taiwan has been one of the most sensitive issues in U.S.-China relations. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory to be retaken by force, if necessary, if it seeks independence. It would regard any recognition of a Taiwanese leader as a head of state as unacceptable.\n\nTaiwan split from the Chinese mainland amid civil war in 1949. The U.S. policy acknowledges the Chinese view over sovereignty, but considers Taiwan's status as unsettled.\n\nAlthough the U.S. does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it has close unofficial ties. Taiwan's government has a representative office in Washington and other U.S. cities. The U.S. also has legal commitments to help Taiwan maintain the ability to defend itself.\n\nTaiwan is separated from China by the 110-mile (177-kilometer)-wide Taiwan Strait. The island counts the U.S. as its most important security partner and source of arms, but it is increasingly outgunned by China.\n\nNed Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said Trump's conversation does not signal any change to long-standing U.S. policy on cross-strait issues.\n\n\"We remain firmly committed to our 'one China' policy,\" Price said. \"Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross-strait relations.\"\n\nThe NSC stressed that every president has benefited from the \"expertise and counsel\" of the State Department on matters like this, which suggested that the White House was frustrated by Trump's conversation with the Taiwanese leader.\n\nStill, the White House said Obama remains committed to a smooth transition to the new administration.\n\nDiplomatic protocol dictates that Taiwanese presidents can transit through the U.S. but not visit Washington.\n\nDouglas Paal, who served as head of the American Institute in Taiwan during the George W. Bush administration, said that to his knowledge the call was unprecedented. He said he expected Beijing to issue a verbal warning that there's no space to change the rules over Taiwan relations.\n\nIn Beijing, a U.S. business group said it expected the new U.S. administration to respect the status quo.\n\n\"American business operating in Asia needs certainty and stability,\" said James Zimmerman, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. \"The new administration needs to get up to speed quickly on the historical tensions and complex dynamics of the region.\"\n\n____\n\nLai reported from Taipei, Taiwan.

One effort that launched this week, called \"WhatDoIDoAboutTrump.com,\" is depicted by its organizers as a non-partisan \"website [that] turns Trump angst into action \u2013 online and off.\"\n\n\"Not sure how to protect yourself if some of Trump's campaign promises become reality?\" the San Francisco-based site asks.\n\nIt provides links to websites of organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which advise people about what steps to take or what they may face if Donald Trump follows through on some of his promises. One link leads to \"Welcome to the OH CRAP! WHAT NOW? SURVIVAL GUIDE,\" which describes itself as \"a crowdsourced collection of health, legal, and safety plans and resources + social, digital and economic security related resources urgent now as an outcome of the recent US election.\"\n\nExperts say scaring consituencies about politics is standard operating procedure for activist groups, but what's different this time are the intensity, and the fact that it has started well before Jan. 20, 2017, when Trump will be sworn in.\n\nCorinna Kester, one of the founders, says the group, which includes a former national press secretary for the Democratic National Committee, is not pushing an agenda.\n\n\"If people are upset about the election, we encourage them to figure out how to get involved and work with that, from donating to petitions to protests.\"\n\nOrganizations and, in many cases, lawyers, are urging people and groups they deem at-risk under a Trump presidency to take action now to protect themselves. School administrators are assuring students concerned about immigration raids that they won't be spirited away, some city officials are vowing to provide a sort-of buffer to any federal attempts to strip benefits or programs. On Monday, the Los Angeles Unified School District announced that it was setting up a hotline and \"support sites\" in response to the deep anxiety among students about Trump as president.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton is organizing a rally of black activists and lawmakers in Washington D.C. days before Trump's inauguration in mid-January to, as he told The Hill, \"put the Democrats on notice to use the confirmation hearings to really go after\" Trump's nominees.\n\nOne of the most high-profile efforts aimed at creating preemptive buffers against Trump policies are so-called sanctuaries for immigrants who are here illegally.\n\nStudents at various colleges are pushing their campuses to be designated sanctuaries. Some cities are moving toward declaring themselves safe zones for such immigrants, saying they will not report them to immigration authorities if they come across them during the course of providing a service.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Santa Ana City Council voted to designate the municipality a sanctuary, a non-binding action that they may make enforceable through an ordinance, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe Times noted that \"the move is in direct defiance of President-elect Donald Trump, who was critical of illegal immigration and sanctuary cities during his campaign.\"\n\n\"The day after Donald Trump got elected, our kids were falling apart emotionally,\" the Times quoted Councilmember Sal Tinajero, who is a high school teacher, as saying. \"They thought their parents would be deported.\"\n\n\"The reason you're seeing this push now is that us leaders ... want to tell them they are going to be protected. If they are going to come for them, they have to come through us first.\"\n\nTrump has denounced such efforts as divisive and the people who have protested his election as \"crybabies.\" His supporters, as well as some who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton or third party candidates, say it behooves everyone to accept the results of the election and work to be united.\n\n\"This sounds like a large group therapy session,\" said Fred Siegel, a historian who is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and professor at Saint Francis College. \"There's a way in which this is all good and right in democratic terms.\"\n\nSiegel said the trend to organize in advance of Trump assuming the presidency is intriguing, and more in line with the kind of actions taken against policies and governments that are seen in Europe, particularly France.\n\n\"We can say, in one sense, it is intensifying divisions in American society,\" Siegel said to FoxNews.com, \"What that represents is President Obama's success in Europeanizing American politics.\"\n\n\"In France, the argument has always been when something occurs in Parliament that is unacceptable to you, you take to the streets. These [actions] are occurring in advance of \u2013 not in response to \u2013 policy being initiated.\"\n\nLouis DeSipio, a political science professor at the University of California-Irvine, said that the patchwork efforts to organize against Trump and his expected policies reflect an already-divided nation.\n\n\"President-elect Trump set out broad principles, and wasn't specific about some policies,\" DeSipio said. \"There will always be people who are unhappy about an election. In any election, you can see a complete reversal of fortunes. The challenge for any president in this situation is to build bridges to some of his former opponents.\"\n\nPresident George W. Bush did so in response to concerns \u2013 among those who did not support his election \u2013 over how he would handle education and Medicare prescription costs, DeSipio said.\n\n\"He worked with Democrats, with Sen. Ted Kennedy, on both of those issues,\" he said.\n\nDeSipio expressed misgivings about efforts underpinned by a refusal to accept Trump as president, a movement that has a hashtag -- #notmypresident.\n\n\"Philosophically, I don't accept it,\" DeSipio said. \"He was accepted by rules in place before the election.\"\n\nThe approach of some groups to try to influence policy and laws at the local level can be both healthier and more practical in many cases, he added.\n\n\"We may get some criticism from Trump supporters,\" said Kester. \"But we're all getting involved in a democracy.\"\n\n\n\nElizabeth Llorente is Senior Reporter for FoxNews.com, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnews.com.

She had a way of just being so brutally candid,\" Hamill said. \"I'd just met her but it was like talking to a person you'd known for ten years.

The new report specifically identifies the chemical in the drug product as \"AMB-FUBINACA,\" and also highlights some of the unique difficulties that arise in the study of synthetic drugs.\u00a0\n\nIt's not entirely clear why the drug, which was sold under the name \"AK-47 24 Karat Gold,\" causes\u00a0\"zombie-like\" symptoms, such as a slow response time to questions, and blank stares, said study senior author Roy Gerona, a clinical chemist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIndeed, these \"zombie\" symptoms are \"a little uncommon\" for people who take\u00a0synthetic marijuana, Gerona told Live Science. Typically, the synthetic marijuana compounds found in these \"mass intoxications\" have more severe effects on people's health, including seizures and kidney damage, he said. But in this case, the only effect observed was the depressant, or \"zombie-like,\" effect, he said.\n\nBut that effect appeared to be a potent one, Gerona added.\n\nIt's difficult for scientists to determine why particular drug compounds are more potent than others in humans, Gerona said. In the new study, published Dec. 14 in The New England Journal of Medicine, Gerona and his colleagues used lab tests to show that the AMB-FUBINACA compound is more potent than compounds found in other versions of synthetic marijuana. Indeed, lab tests showed that AMB-FUBINACA is actually 85 times as potent as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active compound in marijuana, the researchers wrote in their report. However, these lab tests don't always translate to potency in humans, Gerona said.\n\n\"It seems like the effects we're seeing in patients only suggest that [the drug] is potent,\" Gerona said. But the researchers don't know whether that's because the compound is intrinsically potent or because there was a \"misdosing\" in the packets of the product that were sold commercially and taken by the people in New York, he said.\n\nSynthetic marijuana is made by spraying assorted chemicals onto plant material. But \"misdosing\" can result \u2014 for example, if someone adds too much of the\u00a0chemical\u00a0to the herbal material, Gerona said.\n\n\"We couldn't know [about the potency] until we tested the effects in\u00a0animal\u00a0models,\" Gerona said.\n\nBut testing in animal models can take a long time, and by then, the particular type of synthetic marijuana may be off the market.\n\nIndeed, the dynamic market for\u00a0synthetic marijuana compounds\u00a0\u2014 there are thousands of these drugs on the market, and new compounds are being synthesized constantly \u2014 makes it challenging to even create tests to look for these drugs, Gerona said.\n\nNormally, drug tests are \"targeted,\" Gerona said, meaning that the tests look for a specific, known compound. In other words, if someone is given a drug test for opiates and they have\u00a0marijuana\u00a0in their system, the test won't pick up the marijuana, he said.\n\nBut it's much trickier to\u00a0test\u00a0for synthetic marijuana because there are so many forms of the drug.\n\n\"There are literally thousands of designer drugs, so it's not humanly possible to actually\u00a0develop\u00a0a targeted\" drug test for all of them, Gerona said.\n\nTo find out what chemical caused people to become zombie-like in New York, Gerona and his colleagues used blood and urine samples from eight of the intoxicated people. The researchers applied a technique that collected information on all of the compounds present in each sample.\n\nUsually, if the researchers find that one of the compounds in the samples matches the formula for any type of synthetic marijuana, \"that's a tentative identification,\" Gerona said.\n\nBut the problem is that in order to confirm the identification, researchers must match the compound they find in the biological sample to a \"commercial reference standard,\" he said. In some cases, this reference standard could come from a product that's on the market. But if researchers can't find the product on the market, they have to synthesize it themselves, which can take months and is very expensive, he said.\n\nTo get around this problem, Gerona and his colleagues have synthesized a number of compounds that they call \"prophetic\u00a0synthetic cannabinoids,\" or new versions of synthetic marijuana that they think will eventually show up on the market.\n\nIn this particular case, the researchers found that a metabolite of AMB-FUBINACA, or a compound formed when the body breaks down the drug, was a match with one of their \"prophetic\" compounds, Gerona said.\n\nOriginally published on\u00a0Live Science.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.29864263534546, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 737, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 0.642824346533, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 4, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.5427408412483039, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.363636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/12/mass-grave-points-to-is-horrors-to-come-in-push-for-mosul.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [81]}}, "headline": "Mass grave points to ISIS horrors to come in push for Mosul", "wordcount_as_scraped": 858, "date": "20161112190000", "story_content": "HAMAM AL-ALIL, Iraq \u2013 \u00a0For months, ISIS fighters drove thousands of civilians on forced marches across the Nineveh desert into the small town of Hamam al-Alil. Retreating ahead of methodical Iraqi advances on Mosul's southern approach, ISIS fighters converged here, rounding up men, women and children for use as human shields and killing dozens of others.\n\nWhen Iraqi forces began to close in on this cluster of villages along the Tigris River valley, most of the militants fled into Mosul, taking thousands of civilians with them. But before the retreat, ISIS fighters also led hundreds to a garbage dump past an old ISIS training camp and shot them dead, leaving the bodies among the piles of trash.\n\nA week after Hamam al-Alil was retaken from ISIS, and days after a delegation from the central government in Baghdad visited the site, about a dozen bodies remain strewn among piles of garbage on the western edge of the town. The bodies that remained were the ones family members were unable to identify. Some had been decapitated, other have their hands and feet bound. Iraqi officials at the scene said the men were killed for alleged spying in aid of the operation to retake Mosul or having links to the Iraqi government's security forces.\n\nNo efforts to preserve the site were visible on a visit Friday and Iraqi officers reported that wild dogs were eating at the decaying corpses that lay on the edge of an old agriculture college later bombed by coalition aircraft after ISIS converted the sprawling compound into a training base.\n\n\"These were men working with us,\" said Iraqi federal police Cpt. Muhannad Adnan.\n\n\"This is the clearest evidence of the crimes and brutality of Daesh,\" he continued, \"it's also evidence of what happens when we slow our advance. When we move slowly, it allows (ISIS) to plan better and kill more people.\"\n\nAdnan said the town's residents have told his unit that dozens more bodies are buried at the site.\n\nIraqi forces south of Mosul has taken a month to advance some 25 miles, slowly pushing ISIS fighters out of dozens of small villages along the Tigris River and across the desert. On Mosul's east, forces initially advanced faster, but have slowed recently as they have pushed into the city proper.\n\nMany Iraqi forces have largely paused their advance on Mosul over the past four days. Iraqi commanders say they are using the time to consolidate territorial gains ahead of future advances.\n\n\"Our duty should only be to liberate territory and then continue to move forward,\" said Brig. Gen. Shaker Alwan al-Kafaj, the head of the federal police's fifth division.\n\n\"The local police forces had more than a year to prepare for this and now we are finding out that they did almost nothing. Many of them don't even exist,\" he added referring to the problem of so-called ghost soldiers \u2014 non-existent troops whose pay is pocketed by senior officers or enlisted men who don't show up to duty \u2014 that has plagued Iraq's security services for years.\n\nAl-Kafaj has been leading advances south of Mosul since the operation was officially announced on Oct. 17, and says his momentum forward has repeatedly been delayed by inadequate forces to hold the newly gained territory.\n\nMost of the dead found on the western edge of the town were former ISIS prisoners, according to federal police commanders. The building used by the extremists as a prison stood in central Hamam al-Alil on a street of brightly painted homes with fruit trees in their front gardens. Inside, walls were painted black, windows were bricked up and five crude solitary cells were built in a stair well.\n\n\"They didn't want prisoners to know if it was day or night,\" said Imad Ali, a resident who lived down the street from the prison.\n\nMany of the people kept here were men and women charged with relatively minor offenses like smoking cigarettes or breaking the militant group's strict Islamic dress code, according to the federal police officers and residents. People charged with more serious crimes like spying were killed, Ali said.\n\nA front room next to the kitchen was where the interrogations would take place.

But it announced late last week that it was not legally able to pay claims submitted by farmers and livestock owners.\n\n\"The Navajo Nation call upon our Congressional leaders from the states of Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona to do what is right for our people by demanding that the U.S. EPA reconsider its decision and that the U.S. EPA provide full compensation to the many Navajo people who sustained extensive losses due to the spill that was caused by the agency,\" Navajo Nation speaker Lorenzo Bates said last Saturday.\n\n\"When the law allows the government to hide\u00a0from those whom it has harmed, the law must change,\" Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) said\n in a statement.\n\nIn a dramatic speech on the banks of the Animas River last August, Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye announced that the tribe was filing a $159 million lawsuit for damages and $3.2 million to cover expenses that had not been paid.\n\nThe suit was in response to what the tribe said was an inadequate gesture by the EPA to reimburse them $602,000.\n\nLast Friday, the EPA said it was legally prohibited from paying the claims because of sovereign immunity, which prohibits most lawsuits against the government.\u00a0The agency said the only legal option left is to either refile the claims in federal court or have Congress authorize the payments.\n\nThis announcement added insult to injury for Lenora Williams of Upper Fruitland, N.M., who saw 14 acres of her family farm dry up after the spill.\n\n\"They are weaseling out of a big mess they made,\" Williams said. \"The EPA knew they did this.\"\n\nThe toxic spill had a profound economic and emotional impact on Williams and her family, who have been farming on the land for at least five generations.\n\n\"We [planted] Indian corn, melons, and veggies and didn't get to see them grow,\" she said, her voice cracking. \"We watched with great heartache and pain as our crops dried up.\"\n\nWilliams said her family farm helps feed relatives and friends further out on the reservation who do not have access to water or fresh fruit and vegetables.\n\nDespite reassurances from the EPA that the water was safe for plant irrigation, many farmers \u2013 including Williams \u2013 were not taking any chances. They refused to shell out money for seeds, fertilizer and equipment just to see all it contaminated by tainted water.\n\n\"We just had to let it go this year,\" Williams said.\n\nA tribal official said he estimates that about 70 percent of the farmers in the area did not plant crops this year and that was having a significant impact on the local economy. An estimated 2,000 Navajo farmers and ranchers were impacted by the Gold King Mine spill.\n\nStanley Wauneka, president of the nearby San Juan chapter, said farmers just stopped irrigating their fields and now they find themselves in dire straits.\n\n\"It's very upsetting and disappointing, you can't rely on the EPA and government,\" Wauneka said.\n\nThe disaster occurred on Aug. 5, 2015 while EPA crews were working on the abandoned mine when a \"blow out\" occurred, spilling three million gallons of toxic orange water that included heavy metals such as aluminum, arsenic, and iron.\n\nOn Aug. 8, 2015, The\u00a0Navajo Nation\u00a0Commission on Emergency Management declared a state of emergency. Colorado and New Mexico also declared a state of emergency three days later.\n\nNavajo Nation residents in the area were told to stop using the water on Aug. 8 and the ban wasn't lifted until Aug. 21.\n\nBy December 2016, the Navajo Nation had been reimbursed $1,067,794 by the federal government.\n\nIn the EPA's statement on January 14, agency officials said there were no long-term effects on the water quality of the Animas and nearby San Juan Rivers.\n\n\n\nJoseph J.

And the people of Aleppo are only some of those who have suffered or might suffer as a result.\n\nThrough its withdrawal from Middle Eastern affairs, the Obama administration has had a devastating impact on Western interests in the region. But perhaps more importantly, it has had a devastating effect on the civilian populations of the region, chiefly those of Syria and Iran.\n\nIn Aleppo's final days, residents of the city reached international audiences with chilling accounts of pro-Assad forces murdering people on the streets. A city with a 6,000-year history and a defining role in the development of human civilization has been largely reduced to rubble. And all of this has been made possible by a Western policy of neglect.\n\nMeanwhile, in Iran, the theocratic regime that came to power after the 1979 Islamic revolution is harvesting the fruits of a misguided nuclear agreement. The regime has sought to enrich itself with new Western partnerships, but has by no means diminished its anti-Western rhetoric or its threats against other nations in the region. Quite the contrary, that rhetoric and those threats have increased, and Iran has used its newfound wealth to deepen its involvement in the affairs of nearby countries, with Syria being especially prominent among them.\n\nWith this in mind, it is plain to see that Western policies toward Iran and toward Syria are closely connected, and that the crises in both of those countries are symptoms of the same mistaken thinking. \n\nThe crisis in Syria is obvious. It has killed as many as half a million people and has made millions of others into refugees. \n\nIt has allowed the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant to flourish in the midst of the chaos, while the backers of the Assad dictatorship have continued to focus their attention on moderate rebels like those who had held eastern Aleppo prior to this month.\n\nThe crisis in Iran is far less obvious to those who aren't closely watching the country. But those who are understand that public discontent is at an all-time high, necessitating a persistent crackdown on political and civil activism, labor rights movements, and so on. \n\nThe crackdown has swelled the ranks of Iran's political prisoners, and has helped the country to reinforce its reputation as the worst abuser of the death penalty, with the highest per capita rate of executions. However, it has not managed to snuff out the domestic discord, with dissident groups like the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK) continuing to provide organizational structure and active network for activists while also helping to garner foreign support for the cause of regime change.\n\nThere is a need for a shift not only toward reengaging with the Middle East, but also toward engaging with the popular sentiment in those countries, often for the first time.\n\nThat sentiment isn't difficult to understand. The people of Iran want to be free of the repressive theocratic government that jails people for dissent or for being in the same room as someone of the opposite sex. And of course they also want their government to cease wasting Iranian resources in supporting the Assad regime and shedding innocent blood on foreign soil. \n\nMeanwhile, the people of Syria want to be free of the madman who has used chemical weapons and barrel bombs against civilian populations and who even today is directing the wholesale slaughter of people living in rebel-controlled territory. And of course the Syrians, too, want an end to Iran's destructive interference in the region.\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to expect Western policy to help facilitate these goals, which are in line with Western values and ways of life.\n\nIn absence of Western leadership, a small handful of militant theocrats in Tehran are imposing their will on huge swaths of the Middle East. What recent Western policy doesn't seem to realize is that its involvement in the affairs of the Middle East does not have to mean imposing the will of the United States on foreign countries. There is no need for such imposition when popular movements like the Syrian opposition and the Iranian opposition led by Maryam Rajavi clearly want the same things as does the West, namely democratic governance and the freedom to live without fear of arbitrary violence.\n\nPeople are dying in Aleppo; hundreds of thousands have died throughout Syria; and many more will die in the future if the international community continues to enforce a policy of willful neglect. At the same time, people are being tortured and imprisoned for their beliefs throughout Iran; and the situation will only get worse if the West continues to legitimize tyrannical governments while ignoring the voices of local peoples.\n\nCurrent policies must change. The disease of erroneous thinking on Mideast policy must be cured before it manifests even more symptoms than the destruction of Aleppo and the enrichment of Tehran. These consequences are deadly enough, and they leave the whole of the West without legitimacy when countries on both sides of the Atlantic claim to be global defenders of democracy and human rights.\n\n\n\nGiulio Terzi, former Foreign Minister of Italy, is a member of United Against Nuclear Iran's Advisory board.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.361828804016111, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 1, "wordcount": 872, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.1046976186900004, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 7, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161223140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.21100917431193, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/05/trump-taiwan-call-tweets-point-to-flashpoints-with-china.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [69]}}, "headline": "Trump's Taiwan call, tweets point to flashpoints with China", "wordcount_as_scraped": 982, "date": "20161205120000", "story_content": "BEIJING \u2013 \u00a0Donald Trump's unprecedented phone conversation with Taiwan's president and tweets criticizing China point to the possibility of major friction between the world's two largest economies.\n\nTrump's talk with Tsai Ing-wen diverged sharply from U.S. practice since Washington switched diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. Especially noteworthy were his direct reference to Tsai as \"president\" and to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan \u2014 a practice that particularly infuriates Beijing.\n\nThat could dampen Chinese expectations that his election would benefit China through a less confrontational approach and reduced attention to the Asia Pacific region, where China sees itself as eventually supplanting the U.S. as the dominant power.\n\nHere are six areas that could develop into flashpoints.\n\n___\n\nTHE ISSUE: Taiwan.\n\nTHE STICKING POINT: China and Taiwan split during a civil war in 1949 and China threatens to reunite with the island by force if necessary. Although China grudgingly accepts unofficial ties with Taiwan, it objects vociferously to arms sales and any official recognition of the island's government \u2014 both of which Trump referenced in his tweets.\n\nTHE POSSIBLE IMPACT: A leading Chinese scholar says Beijing will take a wait-and-see approach, but one possible response is to punish Taiwan, perhaps by further reducing its scope for participation in international organizations. China has already cut off relations with Tsai's administration and reduced the number of Chinese tourists visiting the island. Similar measures could follow, although how that would affect Trump's approach remains an open question.\n\n___\n\nTHE ISSUE: Trade disputes.\n\nTHE STICKING POINT: In his tweets, Trump accused China of currency manipulation and over-taxation of American imports \u2014 practices seen by some as exacerbating the U.S. trade deficit with China, which rose to $367 billion last year. During the election campaign, Trump proposed a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, something experts say could spark a trade war.\n\nTHE POSSIBLE IMPACT: U.S. businesses that complain of facing unfair barriers in the Chinese market could benefit if Trump's tough talk persuades Beijing to avoid confrontation by making concessions. However, Beijing is equally likely to harden its position and impose retaliatory measures. A significant rise in U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, primarily inexpensive consumer goods, would also hurt lower-income Americans, the sort of people that voted for Trump in large numbers in the election.\n\n___\n\nTHE ISSUE: North Korea.\n\nTHE STICKING POINT: China is the hard-line communist regime's biggest source of trade, aid and diplomatic support, something the U.S. argues gives it unique leverage to press North Korea to end its nuclear and missile programs. Beijing counters that its influence is overstated and strongly implies that Washington's refusal to talk directly to North Korea is impeding progress toward a solution.\n\nTHE POSSIBLE IMPACT: A sharp downturn in the U.S.-China relationship could further reduce Beijing's willingness to pressure North Korea through the imposition of United Nations Security Council sanctions, which it has so far reluctantly supported. That could give North Korea more room to develop nuclear weapons, which it regards as a guarantee against U.S. and South Korean aggression.\n\n___\n\nTHE ISSUE: Korean Peninsula missile defense.\n\nTHE STICKING POINT: China is adamantly opposed to South China's deployment of a highly advanced U.S. anti-missile system known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD. South Korea and the U.S. say it is targeted only at a possible North Korean missile attack, not just on the Korean Peninsula but also on Japan and the U.S. mainland. However, China and Russia say THAAD threatens their security by allowing the U.S. to peer deep into northeastern China and gives the U.S. the ability to launch a pre-emptive first strike.\n\nTHE POSSIBLE IMPACT: As with North Korea in general, severe turbulence in U.S.-China relations will erode China's willingness to cooperate on pressuring the North into giving up its programs. Beijing already opposes any measures that could drive the North Korean regime to the brink, possibly sending refugees into China's northeast and U.S. and South Korean troops to its border. It could also add momentum to China and Russia's budding alliance, stiffening opposition against the West in areas from Syria to arms control.\n\n___\n\nTHE ISSUE: South China Sea.\n\nTHE STICKING POINT: China has been making major strides in asserting its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, its islands and reefs, challenging the U.S. Navy's insistence on free navigation in the disputed, strategically vital waterbody. Trump raised the issue during the campaign and referred to China's fortified man-made islands in his tweet, saying Beijing didn't ask the U.S. if it was OK to \"build a massive military complex in the South China Sea.\"\n\nTHE POSSIBLE IMPACT: Experts, including retired U.S. Navy officers, say China is committed to asserting control over the area and Trump's tough rhetoric \u2014 unless backed by action \u2014 may further its sense of mission. China may move ahead with the long-anticipated step of announcing an air defense zone in the area that would require other countries to report to it and follow China's instructions, presenting the U.S. with yet another security challenge. China could also take stronger action to assert its claims to uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.\n\n___\n\nTHE ISSUE: Human Rights.\n\nTHE STICKING POINT: While Trump has shown little interest in advocating civil liberties in China, past administrations have pushed the cases of imprisoned dissidents, called for respect for the rights of Muslim minorities in China's far northwest, and urged dialogue between Beijing and exiled Tibetan leader the Dalai Lama. Attempts to abandon such advocacy would face heated opposition both in Congress and from rights groups.\n\nTHE POSSIBLE IMPACT: China's growing economic and political clout has emboldened it in defying such pressure, a tendency that grows stronger when relations sour with the U.S. and others. China is likely to become even less accommodating in cases such as blind legal activist Cheng Guangcheng, who was permitted to leave China with his family after taking refuge in the American Embassy in Beijing in 2012.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.85714292526245, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 945, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.18938083251, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205120000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.96296296296296, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/26/trump-poised-for-cost-cutting-battle-with-defense-contractors.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1259]}}, "headline": "Trump poised for cost-cutting battle with defense contractors", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1107, "date": "20161226170000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump's preemptive strike on the price tag of two major projects with leading defense contractors has fiscal hawks hopeful the incoming administration can rein in Pentagon contract costs even as Trump vows to invest in rebuilding the U.S. military.\n\n\"I hope this will be an opportunity to look at the Pentagon more clearly from someone who has not been part of the system,\" Mandy Smithberger, director of military reform for the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), told FoxNews.com.\n\nSince early December, Trump has been browbeating Boeing and Lockheed Martin over the costs of the next Air Force One and the F-35, respectively.\n\n\"I don't need a $4.2 billion airplane to fly around in,\" Trump told \"Fox News Sunday\" earlier this month, referring to Air Force One.\n\nHis criticism led to meetings last week with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson.\n\nMuilenburg afterward committed to deliver the next Air Force One for far less than $4 billion. Trump then turned up the heat on Lockheed, tweeting, \"Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!\"\u00a0\n\nTRUMP ASKS BOEING TO 'PRICE-OUT' ALTERNATIVE TO LOCKHEED'S F-35\n\nHewson put out a statement Friday, after another conversation with Trump, saying she heard his message \"loud and clear.\"\n\n\"I gave him my personal commitment to drive the cost down aggressively,\" she said. \"I know that President-elect Trump wants the very best capability for our military at the lowest cost for taxpayers and we're ready to deliver!\"\n\nThe cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has grown to $400 billion for 2,457 planes to be used by the U.S. and its allies, about twice the initial estimate. Boeing, for its part, was awarded the Air Force One contract in January 2015. The Air Force budget in research and development for the contract is reportedly $2.9 billion through fiscal 2021, while procurement is $1 billion.\n\nTrump's early intervention on these two projects, taking a nearly unprecedented level of interest in contract negotiations for a president-elect, has buoyed groups that for years have tried to control costs for what President Dwight Eisenhower first dubbed the \"military industrial complex.\"\n\nTrump also wants \"lifetime bans\" for Pentagon acquisition officials from ever going to work for defense contractors.\n\nBut watchdogs say, going forward, Trump will have to take more far-reaching actions to keep costs in line.\n\nSmithberger said reforms should include modernization, greater transparency, and comprehensive testing, which POGO calls a \"fly before you buy\" policy.\n\n\"That would absolutely be a key first step if he wants to drain the swamp,\" Smithberger said. \"The Pentagon is not the only problem. Congress aids and abets by using the Pentagon as a jobs program.\"\n\nAs he signals changes for defense contracts, Trump also has vowed to grow the military itself. In a September speech, Trump said he will ask Congress to eliminate the budget-tightening measure known as the defense \"sequester\" while pursuing a force build-up in the Army and Marine Corps, an increase in ships and submarines for the Navy, and an increase in fighter aircraft for the Air Force. How he balances those goals with his push to cut costs remains to be seen.\n\nKey to any Pentagon reforms will be Trump's choice for Defense secretary, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis. The general, however, has been on the board of directors for defense contractor General Dynamics since 2013.\n\n\"It raises some concerns about his ability to reform the system,\" Smithberger said of Mattis.\n\nStill, the retired general's experience as head of U.S. Central Command and as a NATO commander might provide a useful perspective for reform, said Ben Fitzgerald, director technology and national security at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based national security think tank.\n\n\"Trump could be more focused and demand results and accountability\" from the Pentagon, Fitzgerald told FoxNews.com. \"General Mattis is not a contract guy, but he understands the importance of having the right equipment in the hands of our war fighters.\"\n\nBoeing and Lockheed both have stressed they want to deliver value for the U.S. government.\n\n\"Boeing is committed to providing the best value for warfighters and taxpayers,\" company spokesman Todd Belcher told FoxNews.com in a statement. \"That's a goal we share with our partners in the Department of Defense. We work closely with them every day to ensure that we are making strong progress on meeting that goal.\"\n\nThe two firms on the receiving end of Trump's critiques, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, also are in a partnership for the United Launch Alliance, which manufactures rockets. This year, the joint venture got an $860 million contract for maintenance and sustainment.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich backed Trump's tougher tone on contractors, predicting he'll act more like a governor than a traditional president in his level of involvement. He told \"Fox News Sunday\" the Pentagon's acquisition process needs to be \"totally redone.\"\n\n\"Serving notice that we are not trapped by large contractors with big armies of lobbyists is going to shake up Washington as much as any single thing you can do,\" Gingrich said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nThe record of skyrocketing costs and less-than-ideal transparency is ample, pointing to the magnitude of the task ahead.\n\nThe Defense Department hasn't issued a single statement of budgetary resources since the enactment of the 1990 Chief Financial Officers Act, which required such statements from agencies, according to POGO.\n\nIn February, the Defense Department inspector general concluded the Air Force didn't properly negotiate maintenance contracts at the Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, and improperly paid between $9.6 million and $24.9 million in questionable fees to Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Honeywell. In a 2014 report, the Government Accountability Office determined the cost of growth for the Pentagon's weapon programs in 2013 grew by $448 billion with an average delay of two years for completion of projects.\n\nThe Defense Department risks losing its technological advantage over other countries, according to a new report by the Center for a New American Security. The report says the military must create a more market-oriented competitive system. Further, the report states this wouldn't have to increase costs if done effectively.\n\n\"Under such a strategy, the DoD could leverage the almost $2 trillion of global commercial research and development more effectively, mitigate the risks of overruns and program cancellations (estimated from $58 to $116 billion between 1997 and 2015, not including classified programs), and better manage its operational and maintenance costs,\" the report says. \"Above all, this strategy will help the DoD avoid the incalculable costs of losing the nation's military-technical advantage.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.740740716457367, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1062, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.62221910943, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161226170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.2598870056497202, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/24/aid-groups-warn-winter-dangers-for-stranded-migrants.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [74]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 734, "scraper_regex": 780}}, "headline": "Aid groups warn of winter dangers for stranded migrants", "wordcount_as_scraped": 780, "date": "20161124140000", "story_content": "BELGRADE, Serbia \u2013 \u00a0Mohammad Yassin says there are no words to describe the horror of migrant life in an abandoned warehouse in central Belgrade, home to hundreds of people trapped in Serbia en route to the European Union.\n\nThe 28-year-old former news reporter from Afghanistan has been squatting for days in the socialist-era concrete hall in the capital city, waiting for a chance to cross the heavily guarded borders of neighboring EU member states Hungary or Croatia.\n\nAbout 1,000 migrants have occupied the rubbish-strewn sprawling building seeking protection from cold and rain. But the crumbling warehouse with no plumbing, wide glassless windows and gaping holes in the towering wooden roof has offered little shelter.\n\n\"We don't have (a) proper place to sleep or to eat or to drink water, we don't have warm water to take bath,\" Yassin said. \"We are suffering too much hardship ... too much.\"\n\nAid groups have warned that thousands of people like Yassin are scattered throughout the Balkans and in Greece, living in unheated tents, overcrowded camps and other substandard conditions that are becoming more inappropriate with the rapid advance of winter.\n\n\"Children, the elderly and other vulnerable people may die on European soil this winter unless urgent action is taken,\" the International Rescue Committee said in a statement this week.\n\nMany of the homeless migrants set out hoping to get to EU countries, but remain stuck along the former Balkans route \u2014 leading from Turkey through Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia \u2014 after nations closed their borders one after another in March.\n\nWhile the sealed borders have reduced the influx, new migrants still have been pouring in illegally, guided along hidden paths by people smugglers to avoid border patrols. It usually takes weeks, or even months, before they manage to move on to their destinations in the EU.\n\nRados Djurovic, executive director of Serbia's Asylum Protection Center, said up to 2,000 migrants have been living in parks and abandoned houses, in addition to several thousand \u2014 mostly families with children \u2014 staying in overcrowded refugee camps.\n\nDjurovic said harsh living conditions and lack of hope have taken their toll on the migrants, who have become exhausted and irritable. They sometimes fight among themselves \u2014 one such clash in central Belgrade left one person dead and one injured this week.\n\n\"Bad weather and bad conditions have weakened them both psychologically and physically, they are stressed out and disoriented,\" he said. \"People feel abandoned and neglected, so tensions are rising.\"\n\nEarlier this month, a 9-year-old boy was rushed to intensive care from a warehouse in northern Greece after a cooking stove being used as for heating in his family's tent caught fire, , IRC Country Director in Greece Panos Navrozidis said.\n\n\"Unless conditions improve, it is only a matter of time before another needless tragedy strikes,\" Navrozidis warned.\n\nInside the Belgrade warehouse choking smells of urine and smoke mixed as groups of migrants sat by several small fires lit for warmth and cooking. Dozens of dusty blankets lined the concrete floor along with personal belongings in rucksacks or plastic bags.\n\nMigrants have used old furniture or cardboard to divide the space for some privacy. Trousers, shirts and other laundry dry on ropes. Old shelves and drawers now are filled with the migrants' meager property.\n\nSome men were sleeping wrapped in blankets, wearing jackets, woolen caps and gloves. Others listened to music on cellphones or chatted, spreading food from a nearby supermarket on the blankets while trying to create a semblance of a meal in the decrepit space.\n\nOne migrant stripped half-naked, shivering as he washed himself with freezing water, a widening pool forming under his feet. Others lined up to wash dishes.\n\nMany have become sick, infected with lice or skin allergies. Their condition has worsened further after government recently instructed aid groups to halt food deliveries outside official camps, hoping migrants would pull away from the streets.\n\nYet the building's occupants have refused government offers to move to refugee camps where they could apply for asylum legally, fearing possible deportation or being sent to a camp that would push them even farther away from the EU's borders.\n\n\"Camps are far from here, we can't go there, we want to go to foreign countries,\" said Najebullah from Afghanistan, who gave only his first name.\n\nBy one of the fires, 16-year-old Zabir Zahid said he has eaten nothing but potato and bread for weeks. He said he tried once to cross into Hungary, but was pushed back by the Hungarian police.\n\nStill, Zahid said he is determined to reach Austria and never return to Afghanistan.\n\n\"In Afghanistan is fighting, I don't like fighting,\" he said. \"I want a life, I don't want to die.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -9.069211959838869, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 734, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.3105936413, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161124140000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 3.67847411444142, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/12/08/how-skydiving-military-snipers-harnessed-top-oxygen-tech-on-mount-everest.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [381, 2880, 2946, 5123, 5723, 5758, 5973]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 840, "scraper_regex": 973}}, "headline": "How skydiving military snipers harnessed top oxygen tech on Mount Everest", "wordcount_as_scraped": 973, "date": "20161208200000", "story_content": "It looks like something superheroes would wear in a Marvel movie, and acts like a device that can make the impossible possible at extreme heights.\n\nState-of-the-art breathing tech could be the key to US military personnel delivering maximum performance in extreme elevations\u2014and fighting where others cannot.\u00a0\n\nHumans are not made for operating at extreme altitude. As the mountain gets higher, oxygen becomes scarcer. Working in mountainous terrain means forces have to contend with this big challenge.\n\nOne of the most important tools for success in summiting Everest, for example, is oxygen. The same thing applies to maximum military performance at vey high altitudes.\n\nThe TopOutAero system is used widely throughout the Himalayas. It is often credited as the key to successfully scaling a peak, and recognized for dramatically reducing the number of deaths of those attempting to do so.\n\nDefeating hypoxia opens new heights\n\nThe effects of less oxygen tend to be felt above 8,000 \u2013 that's about 3,000 feet higher than Denver.\n\nFactors like the speed of a climb to high altitude, climb difficulty, and increased physical activity translate into a greater chance altitude sickness will strike.\n\nMILITARY VETERANS SMASH SKYDIVING WORLD RECORDS IN THE HIMALAYAS\n\nIn some scenarios lack of oxygen itself can be a killer, but so can the mistakes made due to becoming hypoxic. The impact on the brain can be dramatic and definitely impair performance in insidious ways.\n\nIn a military context, hypoxia can lead to potentially dangerous problems like diminished thought and reaction times, as well as reduced physical performance and early fatigue. It can also cause impaired eyesight, reduce night vision and lead to incorrect depth perception \u2013 all very important when trying to rapidly locate very small landing zones in dangerous conditions or executing grueling missions on the ground in very high altitude mountainous terrain.\n\nWhether climbing a mountain for fun or for work, these factors caused by hypoxia can mean not just the difference between success and failure on a mission\u2013 but also life and death. That's why carrying oxygen is so important.\n\nThe military advantage\n\nThe Multi-purpose Tactical Oxygen System, or MTOS, solves this problem for both high-altitude parachuting and high-elevation alpine trekking.\n\nFor military personnel, MTOS could maximize performance and allow operators to jump out of aircraft and land at extreme altitudes, then move directly on to execute the mission using the same system.\n\nSPECIAL FORCES' PARACHUTES: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nSniper teams could be flown straight up from sea level, insert in the battle space directly, and remain even above 20,000 feet elevations for weeks without any eyesight impairment from hypoxia\u2014provided they were equipped with MTOS.\u00a0\n\nThe MTOS is made by TopOutAero, a company led by Ted Atkins and\u00a0Dr. Ryan Jackson. Atkins built and designed the system, leveraging his expertise as a former Royal Air Force aero systems engineering officer and drawing upon his extensive mountaineering experience. Ryan brings deep aviation medicine knowledge and world-class skydiving expertise and insight to the team.\n\nHow does it work? On-demand breathing\n\nAtkins started work tinkering with a Tornado fighter jet pilot mask, playing with novel ideas that would eventually lead to the best system available.\n\nOne of the keys to it is its success is its simplicity, which reduces the risk of problems. There are also no batteries required, so it's lighter and the system is less likely to fail.\n\nIf extra breath is needed, there is reservoir capacity to cope with a bulk delivery. The system is \"tunable.\" Since the oxygen is on-demand, when your body needs more, the system adapts and provides it. Every oxygen molecule is harnessed by the lungs so that none of the oxygen carried is wasted.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: INSIDE AN EPIC PARACHUTE JUMPING EXPEDITION IN THE HIMALAYAS\n\nAtkins describes it as it will \"fail safe,\" meaning if a component like the valve or reservoir has a problem, then the system will still deliver as much oxygen as current systems and will only lose a percentage of efficiency.\n\nIn the mountaineer's model, you can even visually verify that oxygen is being delivered.\n\nInadequate, old-fashioned, dangerous systems\n\nPrevious systems used to climb Mount Everest and other extremely tall mountains tended to be wasteful and can be dangerously inadequate.\n\nA \"full flow\" system is wasteful because oxygen flows constantly and leads to approximately two thirds of the gas being wasted.\n\nThe other problem is that if oxygen demand spikes, say from a tough climb, then the flow does not increase with the need\u2014 instead you're stuck at the set limited oxygen flow rate. You can increase the flow, but then you are wasting even more gas in the breathing out part of the cycle.\n\nDemand systems are more efficient, but they are more complex and can be unreliable and thus dangerous. But TopOut's modern on-demand system is the best of both worlds, as it's both efficient and reliable.\u00a0\n\nTesting\n\nRecently, a skydiving expedition comprised of military veterans tested cutting-edge gear to the max to conduct solo and tandem jump records in the Himalayas. They relied on the TopOutAero MTOS and achieved four world records.\n\nThe team also rigorously tested it for military scenarios moving straight from world-record-breaking landings to rapid extreme ascents on foot using the MTOS and validated its enhanced performance. You can hear directly from the expedition team about the record breaking extreme military free falls and the dangerous mission scenarios where they used at MTOS at\u00a0Tactical Talk available on iTunes.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAllison Barrie consults at the highest levels of defense, has travelled to more than 70 countries, is a lawyer with four postgraduate degrees and now the author of the new book \"Future Weapons: Access Granted\" \u00a0covering invisible tanks through to thought-controlled fighter jets.

His attorneys say evidence uncovered since then proves he wasn't the killer.\n\nThe 73-year-old has maintained that a group of drug-fueled hippies slaughtered 26-year-old Colette McDonald and their daughters Kimberley, 5, and Kristen, 2, on Feb. 17, 1970, and that his own wounds resulted from his failed attempt to protect his family.\n\nMacDonald told the police he called to their home inside Fort Bragg in North Carolina that he was awakened by the screams of his wife and daughters, then was attacked by three men and a woman with long blond hair and a floppy hat who carried a lighted candle and chanted \"acid is groovy; kill the pigs.\"\n\nProsecutors still contend that the evidence shows MacDonald used a knife and an ice pick to kill them before stabbing himself with a scalpel. They say he donned surgical gloves and used his wife's blood to write the word \"PIG\" over their bed to imitate that year's Charles Manson murders.\n\nIt became known as the \"Fatal Vision\" case, the title of a true-crime book MacDonald had invited author Joe McGinniss to write to demonstrate his innocence. Instead, McGinniss became convinced of his guilt. McGinniss eventually agreed to pay MacDonald $325,000 to settle breach of trust claims.\n\nMacDonald is now challenging a judge's refusal in 2014 to grant him a new trial based on new evidence, including three hairs found at the scene that don't match the family's DNA, and a statement from Jimmy Britt, a deputy U.S. marshal who accused the prosecution of intimidating a key witness.\n\nBritt told defense attorneys in 2005 that Helena Stoeckley, a troubled local woman MacDonald had identified as one of the attackers, told prosecutor Jim Blackburn that she was at the scene of the killings. Britt said Blackburn threatened to indict her with murder if she said so in court. When Stoeckley got on the stand, she said she couldn't remember where she was that night.\n\nStoeckley also told several others that she was present for the murders, but the district court said her heavy drug use makes her alleged confessions unreliable. Britt and Stoeckley have both since died.\n\nU.S. Attorney John Bruce described the defense evidence as insignificant and told the judges Thursday that the case against MacDonald remains strong.\n\nSignificant pieces of Britt's story were proven wrong, making him an unreliable witness, Bruce told the judges. The hair \u2014 which MacDonnell's attorneys say must have come from the intruders \u2014 could have been anyone's, Bruce said.\n\n\"This was a busy apartment with a young family with scores of people around them,\" Bruce said. \"There was dog hair on the bed. Was that evidence of intruders? The MacDonalds didn't own a dog.\"\n\nAppellate Judge Diana Gribbon Motz also questioned how the hair evidence helps MacDonald's case, noting that it did not match Stoeckley's DNA either.\n\n\"It's not as though you have this hair tied to another person of interest,\" Motz told MacDonald attorney Joseph Zeszotarksi Jr.\n\nA ruling from the 4th Circuit could take months or more.\n\nMacDonald, who is serving three consecutive life terms in Cumberland, Maryland, refused to apply for parole for years after becoming eligible in 1991, arguing that doing so would essentially amount to admitting guilt. He finally applied in 2005 \u2014 in part out of a desire to live with the woman he married in 2002 \u2014 but was denied early release. He is not eligible for parole again until 2020.\n\n\"It would be a dishonor to their memory to compromise the truth and 'admit' to something I didn't do \u2014 no matter how long it takes,\" MacDonald said in a 2000 letter to his now-wife, Kathryn MacDonald, which she provided to The Associated Press.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.25641012191772, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 688, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.4629485789400003, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.3255813953488396, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/15/justices-to-hear-free-speech-clash-over-offensive-trademarks.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [73]}}, "headline": "Justices to hear free speech clash over offensive trademarks", "wordcount_as_scraped": 764, "date": "20170115210000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0The Slants aren't exactly a household name when it comes to music, but the Asian-American rock band has certainly made its mark in the legal world.\n\nThe Oregon-based group has spent years locked in a First Amendment battle with the government, which refuses to register a trademark for the band's name because it's considered offensive to Asians.\n\nThat fight will play out Wednesday in the nation's highest court as the justices consider whether a law barring disparaging trademarks violates the band's free-speech rights.\n\nThe case has drawn attention because it could affect the Washington Redskins in a similar fight to keep the football team's lucrative trademark protection. The government canceled the team's trademarks last year after finding they are disparaging to Native Americans.\n\nFor Slants founder Simon Tam, the name was chosen not to offend, but to take on stereotypes about Asian culture. He says the band is reclaiming a term once used as an insult and transforming it into a statement of cultural pride.\n\n\"Words aren't equipped with venomous impact on their own,\" he said in an interview.\" They have to be tied to motive and rooted in context.\"\n\nBut the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office didn't see it that way. It refused to register the name in 2011, saying a trademark can be disparaging even if it's meant to be used in a positive light.\n\nA divided federal appeals court handed the band a victory four years later, ruling that the law prohibiting offensive trademarks is unconstitutional.\n\n\"Whatever our personal feelings about the mark at issue here, or other disparaging marks, the First Amendment forbids government regulators to deny registration because they find the speech likely to offend others,\" Judge Kimberly Moore said for the majority.\n\nThe Obama administration has urged the Supreme Court to overturn that ruling. In legal briefs, the Justice Department argues that the law does not restrict speech, but declines to associate the federal government with \"racial epithets, religious insults and profanity as trademarks.\"\n\nIf the decision is upheld, the government warns it will be forced \"to register, publish and transmit to foreign countries marks containing crude references to women based on parts of their anatomy; the most repellent racial slurs and white supremacist slogans; and demeaning illustrations of the prophet Mohammed and other religious figures.\"\n\nYet the trademark office has approved plenty of crude and offensive trademarks in the past. Those include: Afro Saxons and Dago Swagg clothing, Baked By A Negro bakery products, Retardipedia and Celebretards entertainment services, and the hip-hop band N.W.A., an acronym that includes a racial slur against African-Americans.\n\n\"If their intent is to curtail hate speech, it's not working,\" Tam says. \"Trademark registration is not the mechanism to address those types of things.\"\n\nThe government is relying in part on a 2015 ruling in which the Supreme Court said the state of Texas could ban specialty license plates bearing the Confederate battle flag. The high court ruled 5-4 that the ban was allowed since state-issued license plates were a form of government speech.\n\nBut Megan Carpenter, a professor at Texas A&M University School of Law specializing in intellectual property law, said the Texas case may not extend to trademarks.\n\n\"The trademark office has said time and again that issuance of a trademark registration is not an endorsement of the underlying content,\" Carpenter said.\n\nThe Washington Redskins had hoped to piggyback on the Slants case and have the Supreme Court hear their dispute at the same time \u2014 even before the case finishes working its way through lower courts. But the justices declined to take up the unusual request and a Virginia federal appeals court has put the Redskins case on hold pending the outcome of the Slants case.\n\nA loss of the team's trademark would strip the Redskins of certain legal protections, but would not force it to change the name. The Redskins have said their name honors Native Americans, but the team has faced years of legal challenges from groups that say it's a racial slur.\n\nSeveral American Indian groups that oppose the use of the Redskins name filed a brief in the Slants case calling the adoption of \"racial names\" by sports teams \"an especially derogatory trademark than warrants regulation.\"\n\nAs for the Slants, the band just released a new song called \"From the Heart\" about the upcoming case. Tam says it's \"like an open letter to the trademark office saying we're not going to give up, we're going to continue fighting for what's ours.\"\n\nThe song appears on the band's latest album \"The Band Who Must Not Be Named.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.273504257202149, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 750, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 10, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.3153786416, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170115210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.5333333333333306, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/07/lawyers-make-final-case-to-jury-in-hot-car-murder-trial.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [72]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 736, "scraper_regex": 778}}, "headline": "Lawyers make final case to jury in hot-car murder trial", "wordcount_as_scraped": 778, "date": "20161108000000", "story_content": "BRUNSWICK, Ga. \u2013 \u00a0Prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed on one thing Monday in final arguments to a Georgia jury: When Justin Ross Harris arrived at work more than two years ago and locked his car, his toddler son was left behind in the back seat and suffered a slow and agonizing death.\n\nNow jurors must decide why that happened. Harris' defense attorney argued Monday that his client was \"clueless\" and forgetful. But a prosecutor called Harris a murderer with a \"malignant heart\" who killed his child to escape his family commitments as he sank deeper into a double life of sexual flirting and affairs with women he met online.\n\n\"It's not a case of an adult hating his child,\" prosecutor Chuck Boring told jurors. \"It's just that he loved himself and his other obsessions more than that little boy.\"\n\nHarris left his 22-month-old son, Cooper, strapped into his car seat in the back of his SUV on June 18, 2014. The boy was dead when his father pulled him from the vehicle more than seven hours later. He told police he took Cooper to breakfast that morning and then drove straight to work, forgetting to take the child to day care.\n\nDefense attorney Maddox Kilgore told jurors that police rushed to judgment in concluding a crime had been committed and then used evidence of Harris' affairs outside his marriage \"to essentially bury him in a mountain of his own sexual sins.\" He insisted the child's death was unrelated.\n\n\"If it's an accident, it's not a crime,\" Kilgore said. \"He is responsible. Only him. Nobody else. And he has acknowledged that from day one. But responsible is not the same thing as criminal.\"\n\nThe jurors heard nearly five hours of closing arguments altogether. After giving them legal instructions, the judge sent jurors home Monday evening. They were to begin deliberations Tuesday morning.\n\nThe arguments capped more than a month of courtroom testimony in coastal Brunswick, where Harris' trial was moved from the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County because of pretrial publicity. A native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Harris moved to Georgia in 2012.\n\nBoring told the jury it's impossible to believe Harris forgot about his son. The drive from the Chick-fil-A restaurant where they ate breakfast to the Home Depot office where Harris worked as a web developer was less than a mile. Cooper's car seat faced backward, but was secured in the middle of the SUV's back seats just a few inches from where Harris sat.\n\nEvidence showed Harris returned to his car after lunch to toss a bag of lightbulbs inside. He closed the door within seconds and walked away. And five days before Cooper's death, Harris had watched an online video in which a veterinarian swelters inside a hot car to show the danger to animals.\n\n\"As much as we may not want to believe people are capable for this kind of evil, that's what the facts show in this case,\" Boring said.\n\nKilgore said police and prosecutors ignored evidence that Cooper's death was a terrible accident and Harris had been planning for a future with his wife and son. Gene Brewer, an Arizona State University psychology professor who specializes in memory and attention, testified it would have been possible for Harris to forget about Cooper in a matter of seconds.\n\nEmails and trial testimony showed Harris had been talking with a real estate agent about finding a home in a good school district. And he had taken initial steps to plan a cruise with his wife and Cooper along with the family of Harris' brother.\n\nLeanna Taylor, who divorced Harris in March after a decade of marriage, testified that despite their marital problems, Harris was always a loving and enthusiastic father. Text messages showed Harris even bragged about Cooper to the women he was messaging outside his marriage.\n\nThe jury doesn't have to choose one side's version or their other. While Harris is charged with malice murder, which requires prosecutors to prove he intended to kill his son, he's also charged with felony murder. To convict Harris of that, the jury only must find that Harris caused his son cruel suffering by an act of criminal negligence.\n\nProsecutors also charged Harris with sending sexual text messages and photos to a teenage girl, including during the hours Cooper sat dying in the car. Kilgore said nothing Monday to dispute those charges.\n\nInstead, he argued Harris never let fatherhood prevent him from carrying out his secret sexual escapades, which ranged from flirting online to meeting a prostitute for sex.\n\n\"Ross was already doing whatever he wanted to do,\" Kilgore said. \"Ross had nothing to gain by killing his son.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.942752838134769, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 736, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.13200716356, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161108000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 2.9891304347826098, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/16/civilian-casualties-mount-as-iraqi-forces-advance-in-mosul.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [72]}}, "headline": "Civilian casualties mount as Iraqi forces advance in Mosul", "wordcount_as_scraped": 729, "date": "20170116080000", "story_content": "IRBIL, Iraq \u2013 \u00a0The mortar attack that left Um Yousef blind in one eye and killed two of her children came on the same day that Iraqi forces retook her neighborhood in eastern Mosul from the Islamic State group.\n\n\"We were supposed to be liberated that day,\" she said from her hospital bed in the nearby city of Irbil. She asked to only be identified by a nickname to protect her family members still living inside Mosul.\n\nDoctors at West Irbil Emergency Hospital say cases like Um Yousef's are on the rise as Iraqi forces continue to make gains against IS in their effort to take control of Mosul.\n\nThe blast of the attack that wounded Um Yousef ripped open her daughter's stomach, killing her instantly. Her son Yousef was hit in the head with shrapnel and he slowly bled out as they waited for hours for help. As Um Yousef was evacuated by the Iraqi military, her husband stayed behind in Mosul to bury the two children.\n\n\"I called him by phone, but he just cries, saying nothing,\" she said. Her youngest daughter, just over a year old who lost three of her toes to the blast, played in her lap.\n\nWhen the operation to retake Mosul was launched in October more than a million people were estimated to still be living inside the city. While Iraqi forces largely evacuated civilians from cities like Ramadi and Fallujah that were retaken from IS this year, in Mosul they told people to stay put.\n\nSince Iraqi forces pushed into Mosul's city limits in November, the fight has seen relatively high numbers of civilian casualties. In the first week of January the United Nations said 683 people were injured in the city, and at least 817 were wounded during the last week of December.\n\n\"You would expect in a conflict like this that the number of civilian casualties would be around 15 percent, a high of 20 percent. What we're seeing in Mosul is that nearly 50 percent of all casualties are in fact civilians,\" Lise Grande, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, told reporters at a briefing last week.\n\n\"It's clear that this is because of direct targeting by combatants,\" she said, explaining that IS fighters are targeting civilians as they try to flee militant-held parts of the city.\n\nAid groups opened two new hospitals closer to Mosul this month in an effort to see more civilians faster, but West Irbil Emergency Hospital still receives dozens of injured civilians from Mosul every day and is still operating above capacity, said the hospital's administrator, Dr. Lawand Meran.\n\n\"We are running out of everything, clean gauze, hospital gowns, even simple saline solution,\" said Hazhen Mama, a surgeon.\n\nMama says his work is often complicated by the fact that civilians without immediately life-threatening injuries must wait for days for a security clearance to travel out of Mosul and into Irbil to see a doctor. \"When they arrive here they almost all already have infections,\" he said.\n\nThe slow pace of the Mosul fight has also contributed to the high number of killed and injured civilians. As Iraqi forces slowly push IS out of the city, neighborhoods remain frontlines for longer and it's more difficult for severely wounded civilians to be evacuated.\n\nIraqi leaders initially pledged Mosul would be retaken before January, but the conflict now appears poised to last months longer.\n\nAfter 35-year-old Khalida Ahmed was shot by an IS sniper outside her home in eastern Mosul she had to wait for three days for help to arrive.\n\n\"I was standing at my front gate and I didn't feel anything, but I suddenly fell,\" she said. A man ran over to help her but was also shot and died shortly after, Ahmed said, and began to cry as she told the story. \"He was my neighbor's son,\" she said.\n\nAnother neighbor helped her dress her wound to stop the bleeding.\n\nAfter Iraqi forces retook her neighborhood over the weekend, a Humvee moved her to a field hospital where she was put in an ambulance and brought to Irbil. Now she says she's waiting for surgery to have her hip replaced.\n\n\"I don't know why (IS) shot me,\" she said, \"I didn't have a mobile phone to inform on them, I wasn't resisting them, I'm innocent.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Salar Salim contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.43337631225586, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 698, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.4112114616900002, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170116080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.15186246418338, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/01/27/chiropractor-accused-faking-medical-exams-for-truckers.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [67, 1102, 1108, 3668, 3676, 3875, 3880, 4157, 4215, 4225, 6522, 6528, 7809, 7820]}}, "headline": "Chiropractor accused of faking medical exams for truckers", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1355, "date": "20170127150000", "story_content": "ATLANTA \u2013 \u00a0The big rigs came from all corners of the country.\n\nThey came from Arizona, from Maine, from Washington. By the thousands, they pulled into the Petro Stopping Center, a 24-hour truck stop off Interstate 285 here in Atlanta. There, truckers could find coffee and CB radios, tires and a tattoo shop. There's even a trucker's chapel inside an old shipping container.\n\nThe truck stop was also where they could find Dr. Tony.\n\nA licensed chiropractor, Anthony Lefteris got federally certified in 2014 to conduct the medical exams that truckers must pass to get their commercial driver's license.\n\nLefteris, who worked alone, proved prolific. He could complete nearly as many exams in an hour as a typical federally certified examiner did in a month. In less than three years, he issued more than 6,500 certificates of good health to truckers from 43 states.\n\nThere was just one problem, prosecutors say: He didn't actually do the full medical exam that is required by federal law.\n\nTruckers aren't exactly the healthiest Americans \u2014 a 2010\u00a0study\u00a0found more than half of them smoke cigarettes, and they're twice as likely as other working adults to be morbidly obese. The required medical exam is supposed to weed out those with hearing or vision problems, uncontrolled diabetes or high blood pressure, substance abuse issues, or other conditions that could make them a danger on the road.\n\nLefteris simply did not do many of those tests, court filings allege.\n\nIt was an anonymous tip from a driver that ultimately led to Lefteris's arrest last month. He now faces criminal charges of falsifying documents filed with a federal agency. If convicted on all charges, he could face up to 75 years in prison.\n\nLefteris, 71, has denied any wrongdoing. Neither he nor his lawyers responded to repeated requests for comment.\n\nBut prosecutors say that word of his willingness to falsify medical exams spread faster than a truck racing downhill with no brakes, and drivers who might otherwise have failed their physicals made a point of stopping by his office.\n\n\"There's no reason for any driver in perfect health to go this route,\" John Horn, the US attorney for the northern district of Georgia, told STAT. \"[Lefteris was] taking the underlying risk of a danger on the road, and magnifying it, putting the patient or the public's life at risk.\"\n\nOne of the Department of Transportation's central missions is to keep the nation's roads and highways safe.\n\nA slew of new commercial safety measures \u2014 like bans on texting and handheld cellphone use \u2014 have helped lower the number of US highway fatalities by a fifth since 2005. As part of this broader safety push, the DOT in 2014 launched a national registry of certified medical examiners. Ray LaHood, the former transportation secretary, said the idea was to identify health care professionals who specialized in this exam and understood \"all of the demands required to operate large trucks and passenger buses safely.\"\n\nThere are now more than 50,000 certified medical examiners in the registry, according to Duane DeBruyne, a spokesman for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the DOT agency responsible for trucking regulations. The registry includes doctors, nurses, physician assistants, and other medical practitioners.\n\n\"The National Registry program will help reduce the occurrence of crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving large trucks and buses by making sure you are physically and mentally able to perform your job safely,\" one FMCSA brochure reads.\n\nFMCSA says the medical exam, which is supposed to take 25 minutes to complete, must\u00a0include\u00a0hearing and vision tests, a urine drug screening, and a review of a driver's medical history. Examiners must discern whether truckers have medical conditions making them ineligible for a license \u2014 a\u00a0list\u00a0that includes diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory dysfunction, high blood pressure, and psychiatric disorder, among others.\n\nDeBruyne said FMCSA doesn't track the number of medical practitioners who have lost exam privileges. But at least two \u2014 a small-town Missouri\u00a0chiropractorwho falsified her certificates and a New York\u00a0internist\u00a0who let interns forge his name on forms \u2014 last year pleaded guilty to criminal charges.\n\nThe investigation into \"Dr. Tony\" started with one of his patients.\n\nOn March 6, 2015, a driver known as C.D. \u2014 that's how prosecutors refer to him in court filings \u2014 went to Lefteris's office to obtain a medical certificate, according to a signed affidavit from Tammie Moore, a veteran special agent for the DOT inspector general's office.\n\nLefteris asked if C.D. had any medical issues. C.D. replied he had high blood pressure \u2014 one of the conditions that could make truckers ineligible for a commercial driver's license. Lefteris didn't probe further. He asked some more questions but performed no actual tests, not even a pulse check, before handing C.D. a medical certificate.\n\nThe shoddy exam prompted C.D. to report his experience to Georgia Department of Public Safety compliance officers.\n\nEighteen months later, three of their undercover officers visited Lefteris's office at the Petro Stopping Center. The chiropractor failed to give two of the officers the full array of tests \u2014 neither got urine or hearing tests, for example \u2014 yet each walked out with medical certificates in 10 minutes or less. Lefteris sent the third officer, who acknowledged he was diabetic, to get additional tests elsewhere. Ultimately, the third officer would receive his medical certificate during a follow-up visit.\n\nThe court documents don't say how much Lefteris charged for his exams \u2014 or how much he earned by issuing an average of 360 certificates a month. (On average, federally certified examiners do just 14 a month.)\n\nWhat is clear: Following the undercover operation, DOT agents paid a visit to the truck stop. The agents sat outside Lefteris's office for an hour on the morning of Nov. 9, 2016. They observed 12 people enter his office. Eight left with medical certificates. Only three urine strips were found in the bathroom's trash.\n\nWhen agents entered the office, Lefteris explained the mismatch between the number of exams he'd allegedly conducted and the number of certificates he'd given out by saying he had just taken out the trash. What he didn't know: The agents had been outside, watching. He hadn't taken out the trash.\n\nThree weeks later, they returned to take Lefteris into custody.\n\nThe day\u00a0after\u00a0his arrest, FMCSA removed Lefteris from its national registry and issued a public notice announcing it would revoke thousands of medical certificates issued by the chiropractor.\n\nIn late December, DeBruyne said the agency began sending letters to drivers who had gotten their medical exams from \"Dr. Tony.\" The letter's subject line read, \"URGENT NOTIFICATION: YOUR MEDICAL EXAMINER'S CERTIFICATE WILL BE VOIDED,\" and said each driver had 30 days to be reexamined or else lose their commercial driver's license.\n\n\"You must provide the medical examiner with complete and correct information regarding your health history and current health status,\" the letter said.\n\nLefteris, who is free on $20,000 bond, has agreed to not conduct DOT medical examinations as a condition of his release.\n\nHowever, his chiropractic license still remains active; it was renewed last November, shortly before his arrest, according to an online database maintained by the Georgia secretary of state. Candice Broce, a spokesperson for the office, said it's rare for the state to suspend a professional license after criminal charges are filed; such a move usually comes only after a conviction.\n\nLefteris is clearly hoping to avoid that fate.\n\nHe's hired prominent criminal defense attorney Don Samuel,\u00a0known best\u00a0for getting high-profile clients like NFL stars Ray Lewis and Ben Roethlisberger acquitted. A pre-trial conference is scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nOn a rainy Saturday in January, truckers at the Petro Stopping Center stretched their legs and walked their dogs in a sprawling, fenced-off lot accessible only to those with commercial driver's licenses. They can still find an abundance of amenities to make the long haul a little easier. But Lefteris seems to be long gone. A station clerk said she didn't know where the chiropractor went. The manager said she'd never heard of him.\n\nLefteris, for his part, recently changed his voicemail.\n\n\"This is Dr. Tony,\" it now says. \"The office will be temporarily closed until further notice.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.5913622379303, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1298, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.94859540731, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.8489984591679498, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/08/trumps-cabinet-nominees-get-their-day-before-senate-as-partisan-wrangling-intensifies.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3280, 5909]}}, "headline": "Trump's Cabinet nominees get their day before Senate, as partisan wrangling intensifies", "wordcount_as_scraped": 903, "date": "20170108230000", "story_content": "Confirmation hearings begin this week on Capitol Hill for Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as U.S. attorney general and other Cabinet picks from President-elect Donald Trump -- amid increasing partisan threats about derailing nominees and calls to keep politics out of the process.\n\nThe most recent exchange began Saturday when Democrats called for a delay in the hearings -- including at least seven this week -- because several of Trump's nominees have purportedly failed to complete ethics reviews to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nDemocrats called for the delay based on a letter this weekend from the Office of Government Ethics to Senate leaders stating that some of the nominees scheduled for hearings have yet to complete their ethics review process.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday the complaints are merely \"procedural\" and are being raised by Democrats frustrated about him and fellow Republicans now controlling the House, Senate and White House.\n\n\"I understand that. But we need to sort of grow up here and get past that,\" the Kentucky senator told CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"We confirmed seven Cabinet appointments the day President Obama was sworn in. We didn't like most of them either. But he won the election.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the ethics review is to ensuring wealthy Cabinet members work for the American people instead of \"their own bottom line and that they plan to fully comply with the law.\"\n\nRepublicans are intent on getting as many Trump nominees through the arduous confirmation process before the incoming Republican president takes the oath of office on Jan. 20.\n\nSeveral of Trump's picks are wealth Americans with far-reaching business connections -- Republican mega-donor Betsy DeVos, for education secretary; ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson, for secretary of state; Billionaire private-equity investor Wilbur Ross, for commerce secretary and former Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin for treasury secretary.\n\nDespite all of the wrangling ahead of the Senate confirmation hearings, Trump's nominees will almost certainly get enough votes in the chamber's GOP-led committees. However, they could run into delays when both parties cast final votes on the Senate floor, despite needing only 51 \"yeahs.\"\n\nDemocrats could use procedural moves to extend the debate on each of the nominees. But they don't have the power to use the filibuster to block the nominations, because in the last Congress they changed the threshold on such filibusters from 60 to 51 votes.\n\nThe hearings begin Tuesday with Sessions in the Senate Judiciary Committee, the same panel that in 1986 denied him a federal judgeship, following allegations that he had made racist remarks and called the NAACP \"un-American.\"\n\nStill, Session, an immigration hawk and the first U.S. Senator to endorse Trump, a fellow Republican, is expected to be confirmed without much delay or fight.\n\nStill, civil rights groups are urging a thorough vetting of Sessions. Last week, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks and other group members were arrested after a sit-in protest in Sessions' Mobile, Alabama, office, and could do something similar on Capitol Hill. \u00a0\n\nThe two-day hearing includes a day for Sessions to address the committee, and a day for rebuttal witnesses from those opposing his nomination.\n\nSession will be followed Tuesday by retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, the nominee for the post of Homeland Security secretary.\n\nTillerson's hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to run the State Department, arguable the most important and high-profile Cabinet post, could be the most contentious.\n\nHis job leading oil giant ExxonMobile, which included deals with Russia and connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is raising concerns, especially after a recent U.S. intelligence report stated both meddled in this year's presidential election.\n\nHowever, the expected showdown with Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain -- who last week suggested he'd vote for Tillerson when \"pigs fly\" -- appears less likely.\n\nMcCain said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that still has questions but that a meeting last week with Tillerson eased concerns.\n\n\"Every president should have the benefit of the doubt as to their nominees,\" he said. \"So there has to be a compelling reason not\" to vote for him.\n\nDemocrats and others argue that Ross, who founded the private equity firm WL Ross & Co., is the type of Wall Street tycoon that Trump has vowed to keep out of Washington.\n\nBut Ross' record has so far shown no potentially damaging conflicts of interest.\n\nSchumer and other Democrats have purportedly targeted DeVos, Sessions and Tillerson as well as Mnuchin and South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, for the Office of Management -- whose hearings have yet to be scheduled.\n\n\"If Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they're sorely mistaken,\" Schumer said last week.\n\nOne of the committees that hasn't yet received the ethics review forms is the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which will hold the DeVos hearings.\n\nThe Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee said it had also not received the forms for Ross, though a spokeswoman said they expect them soon.\n\nCommittee aides said they have received ethics forms for Sessions, Tillerson, Treasury Secretary nominee and retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis and Elaine Chao, for transportation secretary.\n\nThe Government Ethics office did not list which of Trump's Cabinet choices hadn't turned in their disclosures.\n\nOther confirmation hearings next week include Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, for director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Ben Carson for housing secretary.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to his report.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.06611561775208, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 880, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 8, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.12811827892, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170108230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5227272727272703, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/17/istanbul-nightclub-shooting-suspect-trained-in-afghanistan-official-says.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [141, 456, 663, 687, 789, 917, 928, 1163, 1424, 1465]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 557, "scraper_regex": 607}}, "headline": "Istanbul nightclub shooting suspect trained in Afghanistan, official says", "wordcount_as_scraped": 607, "date": "20170117150000", "story_content": "The terror suspect accused in the shooting rampage at a nightclub in\u00a0Istanbul early on New Year's Day trained in Afghanistan before traveling to Turkey and launching his attack, a Turkish official announced Tuesday, hours after police finally pulled the bloodied man from the home where he'd been hiding.\n\nFBI ARRESTS WIFE OF ORLANDO NIGHTCLUB MASSACRE GUNMAN OMAR MATEEN\n\nAbdulkadir\u00a0Masharipov, the Uzbek national wanted in the murders of 39 people at the Reina nightclub, was arrested after a police raid on his friend's house in Istanbul's Esenyurt district.

Police searched 152 addresses and 50 people were taken into custody.\n\n\"Together with the terrorist, an Iraqi man was detained as well as three women from various countries -- from Egypt and from Africa,\" Sahin said. \"There is a high chance that they may be connected (to ISIS) because they were staying in the same house.\"\n\nDays after the attack, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said an intelligence agency may have been involved, an assertion he reiterated Monday. But Sahin, when asked about it, declined to comment saying: \"It is too soon to say anything about such connections.\"\n\nSpeaking in Ankara, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the operation to apprehend the suspect was successful and thanked his country's security and intelligence agencies for their efforts.\n\n\"In this country, no one will slip through the net, everyone will be held to account within the limits of the rule of law,\" he said.\n\nTurkey, a member of NATO and a partner in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, has endured multiple attacks attributed to the extremist group. ISIS claimed the assault on the nightclub was retaliation for Turkey's military operations in northern Syria.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.7524113655090305, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 557, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.9241827716799997, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.87253141831239, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/09/south-korean-lawmakers-vote-to-impeach-president-park-geun-hye.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [83]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1071, "scraper_regex": 1125}}, "headline": "South Korean lawmakers vote to impeach President Park Geun-hye", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1125, "date": "20161209140000", "story_content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2013 \u00a0South Korean lawmakers on Friday impeached President Park Geun-hye, a stunning and swift fall for the country's first female leader amid protests that drew millions into the streets in united fury.\n\nAfter the vote, parliamentary officials hand-delivered formal documents to the presidential Blue House that stripped Park of her power and allowed the country's No. 2 official, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, to assume leadership until the Constitutional Court rules on whether Park must permanently step down. The court has up to six months to decide.\n\n\"I'd like to say that I'm deeply sorry to the people because the nation has to experience this turmoil because of my negligence and lack of virtue at a time when our security and economy both face difficulties,\" Park said after the vote, before a closed-door meeting with her Cabinet where she and other aides reportedly broke down in tears.\n\nHwang separately said that he wanted \"the ruling and opposition political parties and the parliament to gather strength and wisdom so that we can return stability to the country and people as soon as possible.\"\n\nOnce called the \"Queen of Elections\" for her ability to pull off wins for her party, Park has been surrounded in the Blue House in recent weeks by millions of South Koreans who have taken to the streets in protest. They are furious over what prosecutors say was collusion by Park with a longtime friend to extort money from companies and to give that confidante extraordinary sway over government decisions.\n\nOrganizers said about 10,000 people gathered in front of the National Assembly to demand that lawmakers pass the impeachment motion. Some had spent the night on the streets after traveling from other cities. Scuffles broke out between angry anti-Park farmers, some of whom had driven tractors to the assembly from their farms, and police. When impeachment happened, many of those gathered raised their hands in the air and leapt about, cheering and laughing.\n\n\"Can you hear the roar of the people in front of the National Assembly?\" Kim Kwan-young, an opposition lawmaker said ahead of the vote, referring to South Korea's formal name. \"Our great people have already opened the way. Let's make it so we can stand honorably in front of history and our descendants.\"\n\nThe handover of power prompted the prime minister to order South Korea's defense minister to put the military on a state of heightened readiness to brace for any potential provocation by North Korea. No suspicious movements by the North were reported, however.\n\nPark will be formally removed from office if at least six of the Constitutional Court's nine justices support her impeachment, and the country would then hold a presidential election within 60 days.\n\nNational Assembly speaker Chung Sye-kyun said the bill on Park's impeachment was passed by a vote of 234 for and 56 opposed, with seven invalid votes and two abstentions. That well surpassed the necessary two-thirds vote needed in the 300-seat assembly, with the opposition getting strong support from members of Park's party.\n\nPresent for the vote were relatives of the victims of a 2014 ferry disaster that killed more than 300 and was blamed in part on government incompetence and corruption; they cheered and clapped after the impeachment was announced. Most lawmakers left the hall quietly, though some could be seen taking selfies as they waited to vote.\n\nLawmakers from both parties faced huge pressure to act against Park, the daughter of a military dictator still revered by many conservatives for lifting the country from poverty in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nHer approval ratings had plunged to 4 percent, the lowest among South Korean leaders since democracy came in the late 1980s, and even elderly conservatives who once made up her political base have distanced themselves from her. An opinion survey released earlier Friday showed 81 percent of respondents supported Park's impeachment.\n\nSouth Korean lawmakers last voted to impeach a president in 2004, when they accused late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun of minor election law violations and incompetence. The Constitutional Court restored Roh's powers about two months later, ruling that his wrongdoings weren't serious enough to justify his unseating.\n\nThe chances of the court reinstating Park are considered low because her charges are much graver. Some legal experts say the court might need more than a couple of months to decide. This is because Park's case is much more complicated than Roh's, and because her lawyers will likely press the court not to uphold the impeachment unless the suspicions against her are proven.\n\nHundreds gathered Friday night at a boulevard in front of an old palace gate in downtown Seoul, which has been the center of demonstrations in recent weeks calling for Park's removal. Protesters planned to march close to the Blue House.\n\nThe impeachment is a remarkable fall for Park, who convincingly beat her liberal opponent in 2012. Park's single, five-year term was originally set to end Feb. 24, 2018.\n\nThe political turmoil around Park comes after years of frustration over a leadership style that inspired comparisons to her father, Park Chung-hee. Critics saw in Park an unwillingness to tolerate dissent as her government cracked down on press freedom, pushed to dissolve a leftist party and allowed aggressive police suppression of anti-government protests, which saw the death of an activist in 2016.\n\nShe also was heavily criticized over her government's handling of the 2014 ferry sinking; most of those victims were school kids.\n\nPark has repeatedly apologized over the public anger caused by the latest scandal, but has denied any legal wrongdoing. She attempted to avoid impeachment last month by making a conditional offer to step down if parliament could come up with a stable power-transfer plan, but the overture was dismissed by opposition lawmakers as a stalling ploy.\n\nIn indicting Park's longtime friend, Choi Soon-sil, and two former presidential aides last month, state prosecutors said they believed the president was \"collusively involved\" in criminal activities by the suspects. Choi and the two former aides were accused of bullying large companies into providing tens of millions of dollars and favors to foundations and businesses Choi controlled, and enabling Choi to interfere with state affairs.\n\nPark's lawyer has called the accusations groundless.\n\nPark first met Choi in the 1970s, around the time Park was acting as first lady after her mother was killed during a 1974 assassination attempt on her father. Choi's father, a shadowy figure named Choi Tae-min who was a Buddhist monk, a religious cult leader and a Christian pastor at different times, emerged as Park's mentor.\n\nThe Choi clan has long been suspected of building a fortune by using their connections with Park to extort companies and government organizations. Choi's ex-husband is also a former close aide of Park's.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.20570945739746, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1071, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 14, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.98551094851, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161209140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.61437908496732, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/30/how-to-love-life-youve-already-got.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1546, "scraper_regex": 1789}}, "headline": "How to love the life you've already got", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1789, "date": "20161231040000", "story_content": "It's January. There are pine needles on the living room floor, leftover pie in the fridge. The house is warm; the sky gray. You're thinking of tackling those tupperware bins, perhaps dismantling the nativity scene and sending it back up into the attic for another year, but then the mailman knocks at your door, arriving with full hands. You greet him, reaching for the fresh stack of bills, belated holiday cards and - prominently displayed on the top of the stack - a woman's interest magazine.\n\nFrom the glossy cover, you see a blonde in a beanie blowing a fistful of snow, flashing a wide smile flocked by bold, colorful headlines:\n\nNew Year, New You!\n\n10 Steps to a Happier Year\n\nAre You Your Own Worst Enemy?\n\nGet Fit In Five Minutes, Really!\n\nThe Best New Year's Resolution Yet\n\nAnd as you shut the door, as you head to the kitchen to drop the mail on a sticky counter littered with remnants of your morning waffle ritual, you begin to survey your home, your family, yourself.\n\nAnd you begin to - slowly, at first - wonder if it's enough.\n\nIn this overflowing age of high-speed Internet and viral popularity, we are offered everything we could possibly imagine to live a fully successful, holistic life. There are life coaches and essential oils, home spas and state-of-the-art juicers. There are TED Talks. Face lifts. There are refrigerators that brew coffee, personal chauffeurs, subscriptions to grocery deliveries. (And when all else fails, there's 2-day shipping on whatever else your heart desires.)\n\nBut when it comes to this mad dash pursuit toward betterment, I often wonder where our pursuits might lead us. Self-actualization, the next best thing, the elusive happiness chase -- can it be found? Does it end well? Is it worth the hunt?\n\nOr are we so busy trying to better our lives that our lives cannot better us?\n\nHave we left any space for acceptance?\n\nAny room for God?\n\nMy husband was born with a brain tumor. It sits there, omniscient, quietly resting on his brain stem. I read in a medical textbook once that his glioma is roughly the size of a grape, the small purple variety I slice in half for my toddler to eat by the fistful on a hot summer day. It is unmoving, unwavering. Inoperable. We were told to keep an eye on it.\n\nWe do, but not really.\n\nMostly, we do what everyone else does. We make plans. We fold our sweaters, mow the lawn. We hit the snooze button. We take the dog to the groomers, buy coffee filters at the grocery store. Burn dinner. Change diapers, tell stories, watch Netflix.\n\nWe are happy, mostly.\n\nBut on the gloomy days, the inevitable ones, I take a peek at the bank statements and the mounting dish pile and the discarded fingernail clippings - and I begin to tally up the years we've lived together, the years we have left, the quiet expiration date his tumor has offered us.\n\nIs this it? I think. Is this what we're given as husband and wife? A shortened life span, a quick marriage?\n\nPerhaps you've felt the lack, too. Perhaps you've spent years trying to accept circumstances that lie just beyond your control. Perhaps you've been wasting days, weeks trying to tame this wild beast we call life and once you've nearly caught it, like a tiger's tail, you've only felt the weight of it all knock you off your feet once again.\n\nBroken legs, broken promises. Lost keys, lost jobs. Lost babies.\n\nSo much of it can appear senseless, yes? Reasonless? Out of control?\n\nBut here's what I know to be true: Life isn't a given. It's a gift.\n\nIt is not ours to make sense of.\n\nBarbara Brown Taylor once wrote, \"The treasure we seek requires no lengthy expedition, no expensive equipment, no superior aptitude or special company. All we lack is the willingness to imagine that we already have everything we need. The only thing missing is our consent to be where we are.\"\n\nIf we can remind ourselves of this - that life isn't a puzzle to be completed, a problem to be solved, a project to be perfected - we can begin to see our lives from a state of abundance, rather than lack.\n\nWe can avoid the temptation to peer at our calendars, our careers, our children to see what we don't have and, instead, we can see clearly what we do:\n\nThis one moment, this one day, this one life.\n\nAs a stylist and former HGTV.com web series host, I'm often asked in interviews a simple, and a not so simple question:\n\nWhat's the best thing you can do to revamp a space?\n\nThere are the usual responses:\n\nRemove heavy draperies; replace with light linens. Experiment with pattern mixing to bring variety, excitement. Paint the walls white. Stick to a simple, natural color scheme. Remember, closed storage will be your best friend.\n\nAnd then there's the one I forget:\n\nAccept it as it is. Show gratitude for the blessing of four walls, for a stocked (albeit likely disorganized) pantry. Survey your home and learn to see abundance. Understand that what is offered to you is a provision, not a project.\n\nIn short: love what you've got.\n\nThis works for our hearts, too, of course. Daily, we sift through cluttered minds and souls as we attempt to make sense of things, as we make grand sweeping theories about life and love and what it means to be messy Christians in a messy world.\n\nOn a good day, we see what we already have.\n\nOn others, we buy the lie that we're not doing enough, that God's grace will run out, that surely this time we've done the unforgivable. That a new home, a new relationship, a new career might be just what we need to feel happy, content, fulfilled. Better.\n\nI'm in need a change, we'll say, forgetting the very promise we know to be true:\n\nA changed circumstance isn't the goal. A changed heart is.\n\nI believe there is only one path to a changed heart, and it must begin with God. Yet there are a few ways to approach God, I think, to begin the change together, and although neither of the below methods are easy, they are both simple enough to be encountered daily, accessed at any time:\n\n1. Pay Attention.\n\n\"I will hear what God the LORD will say; For He will speak peace to His people, to His godly ones.\" -Psalm 85:8\n\nIn today's fast-paced society, multitasking is praised as a valuable skill to hone. And yet, so much of multitasking prevents the ability to practice mindfulness, the art of paying attention. When is the last time we paused to watch the marinara sauce boil, or stopped to think how warm and enveloping the garlic smells without also checking our email, thawing the chicken, wiping down the counters and setting the table?\n\nWhen was the last time we tried to complete a task step by step, just one thing at a time?\n\nWhen we do this - when we practice paying attention - the beauty of life has a way of smacking us right in the face. We notice a toddler's widened eyes and dimpled cheek as she learns to read. We notice the kind smile and weathered hands of a grocery cashier offering us a receipt. We notice the amber flames of a crackling fire while snow spills outside.\n\nWe notice the gift.\n\nAnd in noticing the gift, we notice the Giver.\n\nIt is impossible not to encounter change once we notice the Giver, once we're pulled from the mundane, once we begin to see how many extraordinary ordinaries there truly are in our midst.\n\nTo Try: Challenge yourself to tackle a short chore mindfully. Whether it's dish duty or trash night, focus on the muscles you're using to get the job done. Slow your pace; think of only what you're doing in that very moment and resist the temptation to plan ahead. What do you notice in this moment? What did you see, feel, hear? How can you incorporate this mindfulness in other activities throughout your day?\n\n2. Invite Prayer.\n\n\"Don't worry about anything, but pray about everything. \u2026 Then, because you belong to Christ Jesus, God will bless you with peace that no one can completely understand. And this peace will control the way you think and feel.\" Philippians 4:6-7\n\nWe think of prayer as a lofty word with lofty implications, but prayer can be a simple sentence of reflection, a mere cry for help amidst a frenzied day.\n\nPray about everything, all day long, always and always. That's the only secret I know.\n\nOne of my favorite prayers is also one of the simplest: God, help me see this.\n\nIt breathes life into the most average of evenings and offers calm to the craziest of mornings. 'Help me see this' is simply saying to God, \"Please, show me what to look for. Show me what I'm missing. Show me how you're already providing for me, how I already have everything I need. Show me you.\"\n\nTo Try: In what ways are you complicating prayer? Write down one sentence to repeat to God throughout the day. If it helps, set an alarm in your phone to solidify the habit until you no longer need the reminder. Reflect on the peace you feel throughout the day -- how might your one sentence prayer be changing you?\n\nAnd so, as we go about our January with our stacks of bills, belated holiday cards and that glossy magazine cover that rests on our kitchen counter, let's begin a new practice. As we wipe up sticky breakfast leftovers, as we pile away the Christmas decorations and sweep the pine needles from the rug, let's take pause:\n\nPay attention.\n\nInvite prayer.\n\nLet us forgo the glossy magazine cover. Let us forget the new car, the new sweater, the new book. Let us resist the temptation to control this wild life, to fancy it up, to pad our discomforts with more things that offer temporary relief and momentary fulfillment.\n\nWe've already been given what we need: a new day, with new mercies, offering just enough manna disguised as our morning waffles.\n\nPay attention.\n\nInvite prayer.\n\nMay we enjoy the abundance, today and always. And may we, instead of seeking ways to change our lives, seek the only one who can change our hearts.\n\n\n\nA former art director/stylist in Los Angeles, Erin Loechner has been blogging and speaking for more than a decade.

Another was shot and killed while fighting Castro's men in the Escambray mountains in 1963. Belcourt remembers his frozen remains arriving in a wooden box, water from the slowly melting body dripping onto the floor.\n\n\"I'm 60 years old,\" she said. \"I've never forgotten that water.\"\n\nHer father never forgave Castro for the killings of his two brothers but when Nancy Belcourt's neighbor told her Friday that Fidel Castro was dead, there was only a tiny sense of surprise and then wonder: What next?\n\nCastro's death unleashed powerful public emotions in Cubans on the island and in exile around the world. In Cuba there have been five days of revolutionary fervor, with hundreds of thousands of people singing Castro's praises and pledging their commitment to his socialist system.\n\nBut behind closed doors, feelings have been more complex. A day spent with Belcourt revealed one person's blend of gratitude to Castro's revolution, pain at the violence it unleashed and hope that Cuba will now be able to start looking toward a future that builds on Castro's legacy while leaving its darker side behind.\n\n\"People feel hopeful,\" she said, sitting on a bed in a concrete-walled room in her home in the outskirts of Santa Clara, where Castro's ashes arrived Wednesday, the first stop in a four-day funeral procession taking his remains to the eastern city of Santiago.\n\nThe cortege continued Thursday, leaving in the morning for the central-eastern city of Camaguey on its eastbound route. In Camaguey province, workers were filling potholes and putting a new coat of yellow paint on some traffic signs ahead of the funeral caravan's passing. Hundreds of buses, trucks and even flat-bed trucks were dropping people off to line the route.\n\nBelcourt was born nearly three years before the start of the revolution, the daughter of a housewife and a construction worker with only an elementary school education. Her family lived in a large, colonial-style home in a rural part of Trinidad that became a battleground between then-President Fulgencio Batista's forces and Castro's guerrilla army.\n\nAt one point, her family's adobe home was caught in the crossfire between the two forces \u2014 Batista's soldiers stationed in the front, Castro's in the back.\n\nBullets flew, striking the front door. The gunfire only stopped when Belcourt's sister screamed and the fighters realized there were children inside, she said.\n\nAfter Castro's victory and the deaths of her uncles, Belcourt's family slowly left Trinidad. She and her sisters graduated with university degrees in economics, a first for their family. The toddler one of her uncles left behind fled to the United States, when he grew older and was never heard from again. Other cousins have left to different parts of Cuba and a few she still has contact with live in Florida.\n\nShe went on to have two children and has worked at various state enterprises.\n\n\"I don't think I've lived badly,\" said Belcourt, wearing a bright pink T-shirt with the word \"Nyke\" and the Nike logo that she said she bought from a privately-run business. \"I've never been hungry. Within how you can live here, I have not lived poorly.\"\n\nHer daughter today is a housewife and mother to a 14-year-old girl. Her son operates one of the many bicycle taxis shuttling people around Santa Clara's colorful plazas and bustling, narrow streets. Santa Clara is perhaps most famous for its connection with Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara. Here, he famously derailed a train carrying Batista's soldiers in one of the revolution's final key victories. And it is here where Guevara's remains were taken after being exhumed in Bolivia.\n\nBelcourt didn't sign the condolences book and oath that Cubans have been encouraged to take affirming the revolution's principles in cities around the island. She was caring for her grandson, who was sick with a fever. But the retired accountant made sure her son signed it, because she thought not doing so would have been viewed unkindly.\n\n\"You're 24 years old,\" she told him, \"You're too young to be marking yourself.\"\n\nBelcourt said she hoped the revolutionary leader's death would create an opening allowing members of her children's generation to pursue their own vision for the island nation. She said countries such as the U.S., which long isolated Cuba in large part because of Fidel Castro, might now reconsider their earlier hard-line policies.\n\n\"They blamed him for everything,\" she said. \"Now he's not here.\"\n\nYounger Cubans now have access to cell phones and the internet and see their friends on the island opening small businesses and advancing economically, showing them \"that you can live much better than we do here,\" she said.\n\n\"You only hear about the old people and what happened 60 years ago,\" said Belcourt. \"When are they going to let young people develop their own ideas?\"\n\nBut Belcourt said she doubts Raul Castro's government will be open to significant change. And she wonders what the incoming administration of President Donald Trump will mean for U.S. relations with Cuba.\n\nAs the funeral cortege passed by, she remained inside her three-room home, already decorated with a tiny Christmas tree with lights.\n\n\"Hope is the last thing you lose,\" she said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.95876288414001, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 843, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.44273251683, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161201180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.37247924080664, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/22/arrest-black-man-in-black-church-fire-stirs-debates.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [71]}}, "headline": "Arrest of black man in black church fire stirs debates", "wordcount_as_scraped": 682, "date": "20161223030000", "story_content": "JACKSON, Miss. \u2013 \u00a0The arrest of a black man on a charge of burning a black Mississippi church that was spray-painted with the words \"Vote Trump\" has sparked bickering online and consternation in the community surrounding the church.\n\nAndrew McClinton, 45, made an initial court appearance Thursday in Greenville, a day after he was arrested and charged with a felony: first-degree arson of a place of worship.

The FBI said it would do so, but no hate crimes charges have been filed.\n\nChris Orr, a Greenville resident and former police officer for the city, expressed frustration over the mayor's early words about the fire.\n\n\"I have a lot of respect for the mayor,\" Orr, who is white, said Thursday. \"But, classifying this as a hate crime of a 'historically black church in a black community' before the investigation even got going good was basically profiling the suspect as a white person, whether he directly said it or not.\"\n\nSimmons did not return a call to The Associated Press on Thursday, but his twin brother, Democratic state Sen. Derrick Simmons of Greenville, said the mayor had the right approach.\n\n\"There is a dark past in America and in the Deep South regarding the burning of African-American churches,\" Derrick Simmons said. \"The way law enforcement authorities initially investigated this matter as a hate crime I believe was warranted, considering the past and the history.\"\n\nMany people on Facebook and other social media sites have voiced opinions similar to Orr's, while some African-Americans expressed skepticism about a black man being charged. Derrick Simmons said he has spoken to Greenville residents who were surprised an African-American is accused in the church burning.\n\n\"I think people across racial lines just generally do not expect the person charged with such an act to have the racial makeup of Mr. McClinton,\" Derrick Simmons said.\n\nOfficials haven't revealed what led to McClinton's arrest. Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney, who is also the state fire marshal, said investigators don't believe the fire and vandalism were politically motivated, despite happening a week before the contentious presidential election.\n\nGreenville is a Mississippi River port city and hub of commerce in the cotton-growing delta. About 78 percent of its 32,100 residents are African-American.\n\nHopewell was founded in 1905 in the heart of an African-American neighborhood, and the congregation now has about 200 members. Some walls of the beige brick church survived the fire but the remains of the structure were recently torn down. Rebuilding could take months.\n\nSince the fire, Hopewell members have been worshipping in the chapel at First Baptist Church of Greenville, a predominantly white congregation that says Hopewell can stay as long as it needs a home.\n\nJames Nichols, senior pastor at First Baptist, said Thursday that he's been trying to get in touch with Hopewell Bishop Clarence Green since McClinton's arrest. The two clergymen say they consider themselves brothers in Christ, and Nichols said it's important that people not engage in divisive speculation about why someone would have burned Hopewell. He said the justice system will determine whether McClinton was responsible.\n\n\"A church is deeply hurt and wounded,\" Nichols said of the arrest. \"This is just going to peel that scab right off and make it raw again.\" He called for prayer for everyone concerned.\n\nGreenville is in Washington County, a traditional Democratic stronghold in a solidly Republican state. In the Nov. 8 presidential election, Republican Donald Trump easily carried Mississippi, but Democrat Hillary Clinton received more than twice the vote of Trump in Washington County.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.4719562530517605, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 690, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.327303754180001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 11, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161223030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.21739130434783, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/03/is-ryan-only-hope-to-hold-fractured-house-republicans-together.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [5378]}}, "headline": "Is Ryan the only hope to hold fractured House Republicans together?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 909, "date": "20161103130000", "story_content": "Marshal Josip Broz Tito led the former Yugoslavia for decades before dying in 1980. Balkan scholars argue Tito unified the ethnically diverse country. After his passing, his country held together for 11 years \u2013 before rupturing amid bloody civil wars in 1991.\n\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and current Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., don't have a lot in common with Marshal Tito. But there is at least one relevant parallel. Not much unifies House Republicans these days. But for a while, Boehner, and lately, Ryan, served as a tenuous adhesive to cement unity.\n\nRepublicans were frantic last fall when Boehner abruptly retired. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was on track to succeed Boehner until his bid imploded barely before it started. House Republicans were on the verge of balkanization had Ryan not stepped into the void as speaker.\n\nThere's a reason the Balkans are, well, called the Balkans.\n\nIt sometimes takes a charismatic figure to ally diverse factions. Boehner was that leader for a while among House GOPers. And last fall, Ryan was certainly the only person on whom House Republicans could agree.\n\nWithout Ryan, House Republicans are balkanized. Questions now percolate as to whether the Wisconsin Republican can command the votes to continue as speaker should the GOP retain control of the House, albeit with a diminished majority next year.\n\nRepublicans may have postponed a grisly, internecine, leadership brawl last fall when Ryan reluctantly took the job -- after initially declining. Without a figure like Ryan to claim the gavel, House Republicans may have devolved into chaos as they scrounged for a leader.\n\nOn Wednesday, key members of the House Freedom Caucus huddled in the Washington, D.C., apartment of Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., to discuss tactics in upcoming, internal GOP leadership elections scheduled for November 15. Some Freedom Caucus members and conservatives want to depose Ryan. But no one can match the votes Ryan could muster in a contested race. So does the Freedom Caucus field a candidate?\n\n\"Please do,\" muttered one Ryan loyalist. \"Then they'll be exposed for how little support they have.\"\n\nIt all comes down to mathematics: 236 House Republicans voted on the House floor to propel Ryan to the speaker's suite last October. Nine GOPers defected from Ryan.\n\nNot all Republicans admire the tactics Ryan used to approve an interim spending bill to avoid a government shutdown in late September. The House okayed the plan 342-85 \u2013 170 GOPers voted yea. But 75 Republicans voted no. The government's funded through early December. A December gambit by Ryan to avoid a shutdown which mirrors September's effort could only further infuriate Republicans who oppose Ryan.\n\nDon't forget issues Ryan now has with some pro-Donald Trump lawmakers. If the GOP nominee loses, will Trump himself and other Trump allies excoriate Ryan? Could that make it tougher for some Republicans to support Ryan if their phones melt down with anti-Ryan, Trump-driven vitriol?\n\nThe general election falls next week followed by the internal GOP Conference election on November 15. House Republicans are expected to lose seats. A net loss of 12 Republicans is a good night for the GOP. A bad night is 20 or more losses. Either way, the House Republican Conference will likely be smaller next year. In the GOP Conference vote, a successful candidate for speaker only needs half of the membership plus one. But in January, the speaker must secure 218 votes on the floor, an absolute majority of the entire House.\n\nLet's say House Republicans lose 15 seats next week. House Republicans hold 246 seats with one vacancy. The vacant seat will likely return to Republican hands after the election. Thus, the \"real\" number of House Republicans is 247. A 15 seat GOP loss puts the conference at 232 Republican seats. Then, factor in defectors. If that number is nine like last fall, Ryan may only record 223 votes for speaker. That's five more than needed to win. But it's a thin margin.\n\nNow consider the chances for Republicans to lose more than 15 seats \u2013 to say nothing of more than nine defections. If past is prologue, Ryan or any GOP candidate for speaker could be short of the 218 vote benchmark to win.\n\nWould Ryan even attempt to stay on if he's not guaranteed a win? Could a \"no confidence\" vote damage a future Ryan presidential bid? This explains why some Republicans discreetly laid groundwork for potential leadership campaigns should the dominoes fall.\n\nPossible Ryan successors? Is Kevin McCarthy viable after his aborted speaker run last year? Could House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., gain traction? There would be chatter about Jason Chaffetz or Mike Conaway. Some invoked House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop, R-Utah, who served as speaker of the Utah House. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, commands applause from House Republicans for efforts to reform the tax code for the first time in 30 years.\n\nIt took a while for Yugoslavia to break up. Outside forces simply delayed the battle. The same could be true for House Republicans. A fratricidal altercation awaited the GOP in 2015 had Ryan not run for speaker. And if Ryan faces trouble, we may discover that the party only postponed that family melee.\u00a0\n\nCapitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.

But the chamber's Republican and Democratic leaders this weekend offered sharply different perspectives about the future of the president's 20-plus Cabinet nominees.\n\nTop Senate Democrats on Friday postponed Pompeo's vote saying they wouldn't rush through the confirmation process for Trump and fellow Republicans who control Congress.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday that several of Trump's remaining nominees will be subject to \"a thorough debate.\"\n\nThe New York Democrat said he was \"dubious\" about eight or nine of Trump's picks -- citing potential conflicts of interests and policy stands.\n\nThe Senate has so far confirmed just two Trump nominees: Gens.

John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, said in a joint statement.\n\nTillerson also faces a vote Monday, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nMcCain, Graham and fellow GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida, have questioned whether Tillerson has too many conflicts of interests to champion U.S. policy abroad, especially in Russia.\n\nAs CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson spoke out against U.S. sanctions levied on Moscow following its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014. The penalties cost the energy giant hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe episode became even more of a concern after the U.S. intelligence community concluded Russia meddled in the presidential election to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the White House race.\n\nMcCain and Graham are not on the Foreign Relations committee, like Rubio. However all three will cast a final vote on the Tillerson nomination, if he gets enough votes Monday in the committee, which has 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats.\n\nGraham told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that he was persuaded to back Tillerson after they met privately.\u00a0 According to Graham, Tillerson told him \"when America doesn't lead, other people will, and the vacuum is always filled by bad actors. He said that we have to have a foreign policy that engages the world. We need to lead from the front.\"\n\nMcCain said on ABC's \"This Week\" that he talked to Tillerson about his views on Russia and his duty heading a major corporation.\n\n\"This wasn't an easy call,\" McCain said. \"But I also believe that, when there's doubt, the president, the incoming president, gets the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nRubio, who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination last year, clashed with Tillerson at a hearing earlier this month.\n\nRubio bristled at Tillerson's refusal to label Putin a \"war criminal\" or condemn human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines in strong enough terms. He also chided Tillerson over the need for \"moral clarity.\"\n\nHours after Trump was sworn in on Friday, Rubio was tight-lipped, saying he would make his decision \"certainly before the vote\" Monday and that Tillerson's responses to written questions had addressed \"some of\" his concerns.\n\nStill, a \"no\" vote from Rubio would not doom Tillerson's confirmation, because the nomination could go directly to the Senate floor even without a positive committee recommendation. But it would be an embarrassing rebuke to Trump just as his presidency gets under way, with questions swirling about his ties to Russia.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.7060366868972798, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 684, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.42916167562, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170122230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.3625730994152003, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/03/military-memorial-wildlife-at-odds-in-new-battle-midway.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [105]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 873, "scraper_regex": 953}}, "headline": "Military memorial, wildlife at odds in new Battle of Midway", "wordcount_as_scraped": 953, "date": "20161103210000", "story_content": "MIDWAY ATOLL, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands \u2013 \u00a0The Battle of Midway was a major turning point in World War II's Pacific theater. The remote atoll where thousands died is now a delicate sanctuary for millions of seabirds, and a new battle is pitting preservation of its vaunted military history against the protection of its wildlife.\n\nHalfway between the United States and Asia, Midway's three islets are surrounded by vibrant coral reefs and are home to the biggest colony of Laysan albatrosses on Earth. The large, white and black seabirds pair off and mate for life, nesting and raising their young on Midway.\n\nPresident Barrack Obama recently traveled here to announce the expansion of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, now the world's biggest oceanic preserve.\n\n\"I look forward to knowing that 20 years from now, 40 years from now, 100 years from now, this is a place where people can still come to and see what a place like this looks like when it's not overcrowded and destroyed by human populations,\" Obama said.\n\nThe atoll is a place where many people have lived, and perished \u2014 almost 3,000 in the historic conflict with Japan. And the public hasn't been allowed to visit the refuge or the battle monuments for years.\n\nMidway, about 1,200 miles north of Honolulu, is now a mix of boarded-up buildings left over from the island's military heyday and freshly painted facilities still in use by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nAbout 50 agency staff and volunteers live on the atoll at any given time, staying in renovated military housing.\n\nDuring its military prime, up to 5,000 people were stationed on Midway. A public visitation program in the late 1990s allowed 100 people per week, plus support staff, to stay on the island.\n\nToday, only volunteers, researchers and journalists can request a permit to visit the remote atoll. Approval can take up to a year and isn't guaranteed. Exceptions are made, such as for the battle's upcoming 75th anniversary, when about 25 people will attend a ceremony.\n\n\"Fish and Wildlife has every right and obligation to protect the wildlife, but they also have an obligation to protect the historic sites and the meaning of Midway,\" said James D'Angelo, founder of the International Midway Memorial Foundation. \"It is precisely because of the men that lived and died that that memory should never be forgotten.\"\n\nSix months after the Pearl Harbor attack, American forces turned away the Japanese at Midway and went on the offensive. In all, 2,500 Japanese and 307 Americans were killed in the battle.\n\nThe Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1988 when the atoll was still under Navy control. In 1996, management was transferred to the wildlife agency with a mandate to maintain and preserve not only the wildlife but the atoll's historical significance.\n\nSince 2000, the site has been designated as a National Memorial to the Battle of Midway. The original seaplane hangar is rusted and has shrapnel pockmarks. Behind it, a huge pile of desks, bicycles and broken speedboat engines await removal.\n\nMidway sits amid a collection of man-made debris called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Along Midway's paths are piles of feathers with rings of plastic in the middle \u2014 remnants of birds that died with the plastic in their guts. Each year the agency removes about 20 tons of plastic and debris that washes ashore.\n\nThe critically endangered short-tailed albatross can be found only on Midway and one other small Pacific island. Endangered Hawaiian monk seals and green sea turtles also frequent Midway's shores.\n\nIn 1996, the government reached an agreement with the Georgia-based Phoenix Midway Corp. to help operate the island's visitor program, with lodging, a restaurant, a dive shop and bowling alley, at no cost to taxpayers.\n\nBut, in its six years of operation, the company had only one profitable month, according to a document submitted to Fish and Wildlife and provided to The Associated Press by the memorial foundation.\n\nIn mid-2001, the company pulled out. After that, there was either no visitor program or a limited one.\n\n\"It's financial suicide for anybody to think that they can go in unless they were given the carte blanche rights to run the island,\" said Bob Tracey, Phoenix Midway's former executive vice president.\n\nIn 2014, the Congressional Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs held an oversight hearing about Midway. \"Objective observers can certainly question whether it was a mistake to transfer this sacred ground to an agency that is far better equipped to maintain birds than visitors,\" said the chairman, Rep. John Fleming, R-La.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office concluded in 2016 that the wildlife agency maintained most historic properties but tore down seven others without the required public notice.\n\nBut the GAO noted funding has been slashed from $4 million annually to less than $3 million, resulting in the end of public visitation in 2012.\n\nOfficials say more than $1 million a year would be required to reestablish a visitation program, excluding startup costs.\n\nMatthew Brown, Fish and Wildlife's superintendent for the marine national monument, said sustainable tourism is feasible despite the challenges. \"It's a very logistically challenging place to do anything,\" he said.\n\nIts World War II-era structures weren't built to last, and some are coated in lead paint, Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Megan Nagel said, noting Laysan albatross ingest the paint chips, causing illness.\n\nToo many visitors could disturb the delicate ecosystem, Nagel said.\n\nSome contend a private company could easily profit from a Midway visitation program, but \"evidence shows that is historical fiction,\" Guam Rep. Madeleine Bordallo said at the 2014 congressional hearing. \"Preservation of historic resources is expensive. If we value it as a country, we should pay for it.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.76406717300415, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 873, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.04511531354, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161103210000, "PurityVirtue": 3, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.0, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.78006872852234, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/12/03/us-watching-cuban-migrants-following-castro-death/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [69]}}, "headline": "U.S. watching Cuban migrants following Castro's death  ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 696, "date": "20161203220000", "story_content": "MIAMI (AP)  \u2013 \u00a0Rodolfo Lledes departed Cuba and headed for Florida with 26 others on a motorized raft made of empty 55-gallon drums. Claudia Cruz Perez wound her way on buses, boats and planes through South America to the U.S.-Mexico border, eventually landing in Miami.\n\nMany migrants like them make the journey because of what they call appalling conditions or political persecution, but also because of the U.S. \"wet-foot, dry-foot\" policy that shields Cubans from deportation if they make it to U.S. soil. Now, the death of longtime Cuban leader Fidel Castro and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's hardline stance on curbing illegal immigration have cast new uncertainty over that decades-old policy.\n\nArrivals from the communist-ruled island already had surged in the past two years because of fears that the policy would be discontinued as President Barack Obama sought warmer relations, the U.S. Coast Guard has said, and now officials are on alert for another uptick in sea crossings.\n\nWhile it's too soon to note a definitive trend, the U.S. Coast Guard intercepted 38 Cubans in the South Florida Straits and brought them back to Cuba on Thursday. Under \"wet-foot, dry-foot,\" migrants intercepted at sea are returned to Cuba.\n\n\"It's not right to recommend that anyone leave by raft, because it's a trip that can lead to death,\" said Lledes, a Castro opponent who fled Cuba after being sent to a work camp and being blacklisted from getting a job. \"But the reality of living in Cuba can lead to that, and much more.\"\n\nLledes made his crossing in September 1994, during the so-called Cuban rafter crisis. The Coast Guard stopped the homemade vessel, and he was sent to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay. In all, about 30,000 rafters were held at Guantanamo during the crisis. Lledes was later flown to the U.S., where he worked as a truck driver in Miami. He became an American citizen, bought a house and is now retired at age 71.\n\nSince Obama ordered restoration of diplomatic relations between Washington and Havana in December 2014, the U.S. Coast Guard has noted a significant uptick each year in the number of Cuban migrants who brave the dangerous Straits of Florida and arrive on the coast of South Florida, the islands of the Florida Keys or elsewhere.\n\nDuring the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, U.S. authorities captured, intercepted or chased away 7,411 Cuban migrants \u2014 an increase over 3,737 in the 2014 fiscal year and 2,218 in 2013. An additional 827 tried to make the trip since October, the Coast Guard said. It's not clear how many others have died at sea.\n\nCastro's death is unlikely to significantly change living conditions in Cuba, as Raul Castro continues the communist rule he took over from his ailing brother in 2008. That means migrants will likely continue to set sail, especially if there is even a perception that the \"wet-foot, dry-foot\" policy may be restricted.\n\n\"It's almost impossible to think that there's an improved future in Cuba under the current conditions,\" said Pedro Roig, senior research associate at the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami. \"It's very feasible that any Cuban, man or woman, would want to seek another horizon under these laws.\"\n\nCruz Perez made her circuitous journey in 2015, arriving in October of that year after what she said had been concern among those on the island about the future of U.S.-Cuba immigration policy.\n\nBut more important, she said, was daily survival in Cuba, where necessities like soap and toilet paper often are hard to obtain. She doesn't think Fidel Castro's death alone will have an immediate impact, given that Raul Castro has handled the nation's governing since 2008. People will still come to the U.S. to seek work and send money and goods to relatives left behind, or eventually bring loved ones to the U.S.\n\n\"If one has children, one almost has to leave the island to seek a better life and a better future for them,\" said Cruz, who works a night shift at a printing factory. \"That is why people risk their lives to leave.\"\n\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.17227458953857, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 663, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.9541957835000003, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161203220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.3182503770739102, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/29/colombian-rebels-fear-for-safety-after-rejoin-society.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [79]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 850, "scraper_regex": 904}}, "headline": "Colombian rebels fear for safety after they rejoin society", "wordcount_as_scraped": 904, "date": "20161229180000", "story_content": "MEDELLIN, Colombia \u2013 \u00a0When Wilson Lopez lived in the jungle, he thought civilian life in the city meant meeting people, walking the streets, having a job. But the former Colombian guerrilla wasn't able to do any of these things.\n\nLopez went from a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia jungle camp to prison and then to the streets of Medellin after receiving a pardon in January. Since then, he hasn't been able to find a steady job or home, and couldn't go for stroll with his family in Medellin after he received death threats from a criminal group that said it didn't want rebels in its territory.\n\n\"I am in the mouth of the tiger,\" said Lopez, who agreed to speak with The Associated Press inside a warehouse in the capital of Colombia's mountainous Antioquia province. He wore a cap pulled low over his face and was accompanied by a friend.\n\nLopez was one of 30 rebel prisoners pardoned by the government of President Juan Manuel Santos as a confidence-building gesture to advance peace talks with the FARC, as Latin America's last major leftist guerrilla army is known. Lopez's troubles integrating into civilian life highlight the difficulties that some 8,000 FARC guerrillas and 4,000 prisoners will face in rejoining society as part of the historic peace pact ratified by the country's congress on Nov. 30.\n\nExperts say reintegrating rebels may face an especially hostile welcome in areas with high levels of crime and drug trafficking, and in areas that were previously under FARC control.\n\nTrust is difficult to build following a 52-year conflict characterized by brutality. Fighting between guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and the armed forces has, according to government figures, left a toll of more than 220,000 dead, some 40,000 disappeared and over 5 million driven from their homes.\n\nThe guerrillas recall how during 1980s peace talks that ultimately failed, the FARC established a party known as the Patriotic Union as its political arm. In just a few years, more than 3,000 leftist activists, rebel sympathizers and two presidential candidates were gunned down by paramilitaries, often working with state security forces.\n\n\"There is a need for more action by the government and the creation of mechanisms to protect\" rebels who lay down their arms as part of the peace deal, said Todd Howland, the representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia. \"There is much to do in the field.\"\n\nJust this month, another 110 inmates were pardoned and the FARC is demanding that all its prisoners be released if the group is to lay down its arms.\n\nFor Lopez, who had spent two decades in the FARC and was jailed in 2010, the problems for himself, his wife and two children began soon after he was released from prison.\n\nHe said he was intercepted in the street by three men who told him that guerrillas were not welcome in the area. Then he received three threatening letters signed by a gang called \"The Rastrojos.\"\n\nOne of the letters read: \"You and your family are declared military targets by our organization. For the health of you and your family, you have 12 hours to leave this house.\" The letter had been slipped under the door.\n\nHe asked authorities for help and he now lives under police guard in a rural area four hours from Medellin \u2014 the area that saw the birth of Colombia's paramilitaries.\n\nHe recalled that when his protection team arrived, he was so afraid he hid and didn't emerge until he had received a telephone call confirming who they were. They told him they had been looking for him for three months and he responded that he moved constantly for his family's security.\n\n\"I don't trust anyone and in you even less,\" Lopez said he told the agents.\n\nAttacks on community leaders and human rights activists have jumped this year, especially since the initial peace accord was signed on Sept. 26. That pact was rejected by voters in a referendum and the sides hastily negotiated a second deal that was passed by congress a month ago. According to United Nations' figures, 52 have been killed from January through November, and other organizations say the number has topped 70. Forty-one were killed in all of 2015.\n\nMany of those killings have taken place in areas where the FARC has withdrawn to begin its disarmament.\n\nAdam Isacson, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the large majority of the attacks have been on members of the community and human rights groups, but not on their leaders.\n\n\"Something similar could happen with the FARC; its leaders will be well protected, but the lower-level guerrillas will be in greater danger,\" he said.\n\nThroughout his life, Lopez has only known violence. He said that when he was a child, his family was killed by armed men who accused them of being guerrillas. He wasn't able to study and never learned how to read or write.\n\nAs a teenager, he tried to farm some land but he received threats telling him to leave or be killed. He said he joined the FARC to seek vengeance.\n\nLopez said he doesn't want more war, but he can't help thinking about what will happen if reintegrating FARC rebels are killed.\n\n\"If they kill 20 or 30 of us, we are going to take up arms again,\" he warned. \"We are not going to let ourselves be killed.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 7, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.4482758045196498, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 850, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.03212818294, "HarmVirtue": 12, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 51, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.0, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.63636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/30/globalization-took-hits-in-2016-will-2017-lead-to-more.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [65]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1069, "scraper_regex": 1137}}, "headline": "Globalization took hits in 2016; Will 2017 lead to more?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1137, "date": "20161230180000", "story_content": "LONDON \u2013 \u00a0Globalization, the path that the world economy has largely followed for decades, took some hefty blows in 2016.\n\nThe election of Donald Trump as U.S. president and Britain's decision to leave the European Union have raised questions over the future of tariff-free trade and companies' freedom to move production to lower-cost countries.\n\nBorders are back in vogue. Economic nationalism is paying political dividends.\n\n\"We want our country back\" was the rallying cry of those backing Brexit, a sound bite that had echoes in Trump's \"Make America great again.\"\n\nThe rise of Trump and the triumph of Brexit had their roots in the global financial crisis of 2008. Eight years later, the world economy has still not yet fully gotten past that shock to its confidence \u2014 people are nervous, some are angry, and many are seeking novel solutions to their problems. Next year, there's scope for more uncertainty with elections in France and Germany.\n\nHere's a look at the year's top business stories for 2016:\n\n___\n\nBREXIT SHOCK\n\nIn what was a sign of things to come, Britain voted to leave the EU in a referendum in June. The decision came as a surprise \u2014 certainly to bookmakers and many pollsters who had consistently given the \"remain\" side the edge \u2014 and means Britain has to redefine itself after 43 years of EU membership. David Cameron resigned as prime minister after the vote and the new Conservative government led by Theresa May is planning to trigger the formal process by which Britain exits the EU early next year. There are many shades of potential Brexit, from an outright divorce that could put up tariffs on goods and services, to a more amicable parting that sees many of the current trading arrangements kept in place. The pound's fall to a 31-year low below $1.20 at one point is testament to that uncertainty.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP CARD\n\nPollsters and bookmakers got it wrong again a few months later when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election. Whether he translates his \"America First\" platform into action following his inauguration in January will help shape the global economy for the next four years at least. Trump has railed against long-standing trading agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, and vowed to punish China for the way it devalues its currency against the dollar and to tax U.S. firms that move jobs overseas. He has also laid out plans to bring America's creaking infrastructure up to 21st-century standards, a new spending pitch that has the potential to boost jobs \u2014 but which could also lay the seeds of higher inflation.\n\n___\n\nMARKETS MARCH ON\n\nTrump's victory did not cause the bottom to fall out of the stock market rally that's been largely in place since 2009, when the world economy started to first claw out of its deepest recession since World War II. In fact, both the Dow and the S&P 500 rallied to hit a series of record highs. Stocks have also benefited from a raft of big corporate deals this year \u2014 executives are seeing takeovers as a fast way to generate growth in a low-growth global economy disrupted by non-stop technological innovations. Notable deals in 2016 included the $85 billion merger of Time Warner and AT&T and the $57 billion takeover of Monsanto by Germany medicine and farm-chemical maker Bayer. The $100 billion takeover of SABMiller by Budweiser maker Anheuser-Busch InBev was also completed.\n\n___\n\nFED FINALLY DELIVERS\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump said Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen should be \"ashamed\" of the way she's run policy since taking the helm in 2014. A year ago, the Fed appeared set to follow up its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade with three or four more in 2016. But there was no move until Dec. 14, when the U.S. central bank raised its main interest rate to a range between 0.5 percent and 0.75 percent. Many factors explained its hesitation to raise rates, including unease over the global impact of China's economic slowdown and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election. But with the U.S. economy continuing to do better than most developed countries \u2014 with unemployment below 5 percent and inflation edging up \u2014 the Fed finally delivered another hike. The markets are predicting another three or four increases next year. Those expectations have helped the dollar rally, especially as other major central banks persevere with super-loose monetary policies to breathe life into their economies.\n\n___\n\nCHINA'S KEY ROLE\n\nAs the world's second-largest economy, China is playing a bigger role in the functioning of the global economy. Nowhere was that more evident than in the early months of 2016, when jitters over the scale of the slowdown in China caused wild swings in financial markets. Stocks took a pounding while commodities tanked, with oil skidding to 13-year lows, as traders factored in lower demand from resource-hungry China. The slump in commodities weighed heavily on economies like Australia that are big exporters of raw materials. China's economy is ending the year in relatively good health as authorities try to pivot the economy's focus from manufacturing to more consumer spending. But Trump's promises to take a tough stance in trade will be of concern to Beijing.\n\n___\n\nOPEC TAKES A STAND\n\nFor the first time since December 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its production levels in 2016. November's cut, soon followed by more cuts by non-OPEC countries like Russia, helped push oil prices sharply higher. At over $50 a barrel, benchmark New York crude is now well above the near-13-year lows around $30 recorded at the start of 2016, when investors focused on high supply and concerns over an economic slowdown. The oil slump helped put several crude-producing countries into severe recessions, including Brazil and Venezuela, and even saw wealthy Saudi Arabia cut back on spending. The question for 2017 is whether OPEC \u2014 and non-OPEC \u2014 countries can deliver on their production promises. If they do and higher oil prices stick, that will push up inflation in the global economy.\n\n___\n\nIT JUST GRATES\n\nOne of the major reasons why popular sentiment has turned against governments has been a growing distrust of elites. Perhaps nothing illustrated the issue more than the \"Panama Papers,\" a leaked trove of data on thousands of offshore accounts that helped the wealthy, the powerful and celebrities shelter their cash from the taxman, often without breaking the law. Critics say these tax schemes are the core of a system that gives an unfair advantage to big corporations and the wealthy. Outrage grew in the U.S. when it was revealed that Wells Fargo employees opened up to 2 million bank and credit card accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. Bank employees also allegedly moved money between those accounts and created fake email addresses to sign customers up for online banking.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.14168047904968, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1069, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.8999540851469999, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161230180000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 0.9354536950420951, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/science/2017/01/27/50th-anniversary-apollo-1-fire-what-nasa-learned-from-tragic-accident.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [7727]}}, "headline": "50th anniversary of Apollo 1 fire: What NASA learned from the tragic accident ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1282, "date": "20170127190000", "story_content": "This time of year is always a somber one for NASA as the space agency remembers the astronauts who died in three horrific spaceflight disasters.\n\nJan. 27 marks the 50th anniversary of the first major, deadly disaster for the U.S. space program: the Apollo 1 fire . On Jan. 27, 1967, a fire erupted inside the Apollo command module during a preflight rehearsal test, killing three astronauts who were trapped inside.\n\nCoincidentally, two other deadly spaceflight accidents that occurred decades later happened around the same time of year. On Jan. 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff, killing all seven crewmembers. Tragedy struck again on Feb. 1, 2003, when the space shuttle Columbia broke into pieces as it returned to Earth, killing another seven astronauts.\n\nTo honor the brave astronauts who lost their lives in the line of duty, NASA holds a series of ceremonies every year. On Friday NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida is unveiling a new Apollo 1 tribute in its visitor complex at the Apollo/Saturn V Center.\n\nFor its official \"Day of Remembrance\" on Tuesday, Jan. 31, NASA will hold an observance and wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia by the graves of Apollo 1 astronauts Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee.\n\nAlthough the coming days may be a time of mourning for NASA and the rest of the nation, it's worth acknowledging that these terrible tragedies also served as crucial learning experiences that helped to make human spaceflight safer for the astronauts who later flew into space.\n\nThe Apollo 1 mission was supposed to be the first of several crewed flights NASA conducted to prepare for its first moon landing. But the spacecraft never made it off the launchpad, and it was destroyed nearly a month before its planned launch date, Feb. 21, 1967. [ Photos: The Apollo 1 Fire ]\n\nOn Jan. 27 at 1 p.m. EST, the three crewmembers entered the Apollo control module for a launch countdown simulation called a \"plugs-out\" test, which would determine whether the spacecraft was capable of operating on internal power. The Saturn IB rocket that would have launched the crew module into Earth's orbit was not involved in this routine and seemingly safe prelaunch test. Needless to say, the spacecraft flunked that test. Many people at NASA felt that it wasn't ready for such a test to begin with.\n\nThe crew spent the entire afternoon sitting inside the space capsule while debugging problems, including a foul odor emanating from the oxygen tank and a faulty communication system. \"How are we going to get to the moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings?\" Grissom shouted from inside the capsule.\n\nGrissom was \"very vocal about the shortcomings of the spacecraft,\" and the crew often complained to higher-ups that the spacecraft was not ready, former NASA astronaut Tom Jones told Space.com. When Grissom realized that raising his voice wasn't making much of a difference, he famously picked a lemon from his citrus tree at home and brought it to Cape Kennedy (now known as Cape Canaveral ), where he hung it on the defective spacecraft.\n\nAs the crew went over their checklist inside the module, suddenly, the spacecraft's interior became engulfed in flames. Heat caused the air pressure inside the spacecraft to rise, making it impossible for the astronauts to open the hatch, which was designed to open inward. After about 30 seconds, the spacecraft ruptured. NASA's ground crew tried desperately to rescue the astronauts, but they died of asphyxiation before rescuers were able to get them out of the spacecraft.\n\nThat stray spark appeared to have originated in a bundle of wires. But that was only the beginning of a series of critical mistakes that led to the fire; far more concerning was the abundance of flammable materials inside the spacecraft. Arguably the biggest mistake they made was to fill the air with pure oxygen rather than a mix of oxygen and nitrogen like the air of Earth's atmosphere. Pure oxygen is extremely flammable. Top that off with combustible materials \u2014 including Velcro, nylon netting, foam pads and bundles of wiring \u2014 and you have \"fuel for a 100 percent oxygen environment,\" NASA historian Roger Launius told Space.com.\n\nLaunius said that people at NASA knew about the major design flaws, particularly the unsafe flammable materials inside the spacecraft, for two years before the accident happened. \"So why didn't they figure this out beforehand, before somebody died?\" Launius said. \"That's something that has never been adequately answered in my mind.\"\n\nIt seems as though political pressure to get to the moon in the height of the space race might have led NASA officials to overlook some safety concerns in favor of beating Russia to the moon. \"Back in the '60s, NASA was brand-new \u2026 and setting the goal of getting to the moon in less than nine years was pretty ambitious,\" Leroy Chiao, a former NASA astronaut, told Space.com.\n\nPerhaps the Apollo 1 fire could have been prevented if the United States had not been caught up in a race to get to the moon. On the other hand, it's important to remember that NASA was attempting to do something that had never been done before, and that comes with an inherent risk, Chiao noted. \"NASA was still learning,\" Chiao said. \"In hindsight, it's easy to criticize NASA for the decisions that were made, but the reality is that they were still figuring it out.\"\n\nAlthough NASA had put astronauts in space before, with its Mercury program and subsequent Gemini program, the first Apollo mission was not exactly a routine operation. \"The Apollo was not a modified version of the Gemini spacecraft ; it was a brand-new spaceship and it had about five years of development time, but it was not ready to fly by January,\" Jones told Space.com. \"It had a lot of problems in development, assembly and testing.\"\n\nThis was no secret in the months leading up to the accident. The spacecraft had undergone several design changes that delayed the original planned launch date. A combination of political pressure and schedule delays created a recipe for disaster as NASA worked to undertake one of the most difficult and ambitious space missions in human history.\n\nNASA lost three incredibly important astronauts in the Apollo 1 fire. Grissom was among the original Mercury astronauts and was the second American to fly to space. His crewmate Ed White became the first American to perform a spacewalk, which he did during the Gemini 4 mission in 1965. The third crewmember, Roger Chaffee, was a Navy lieutenant commander and a spaceflight rookie. Chaffee was looking forward to his first spaceflight and once said, \"I think it will be a lot of fun.\"\n\nLosing these brave astronauts was tragic, but some good did come out of the incident despite their deaths. NASA learned from the mistakes, and spacecraft are now much safer than they were then. Flammable materials no longer fill the inside of crew capsules. Hatches are now easier to open, so astronauts can escape in seconds in case of an emergency.\n\nGrissom, White and Chafee died heroes because their tragedy was the wake-up call that NASA needed in order to prevent more potentially fatal incidents.\n\nThere will always be risks with human spaceflight, Chiao said, but it has certainly become safer over the years.\n\n\"I think it's important for everyone to not only respect the astronauts who are no longer with us, but to think about the space program and what it's done for us not only as a driver of technology but also \u2014 and I think more importantly \u2014 as something that gets young people excited and inspires them to dream big,\" Chiao said.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.2763533592224103, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1238, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.9750509984, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.69628432956381, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/05/never-go-to-bed-angry-sleep-makes-it-harder-to-forget-bad-thoughts.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "'Never go to bed angry': Sleep makes it harder to forget bad thoughts", "wordcount_as_scraped": 534, "date": "20161205140000", "story_content": "The age-old advice to \"never go to bed angry\" is getting some support from new research.\n\nResearchers found that men in the study were less able to suppress a negative memory after they slept than they were before they slept.\n\nNormally, sleep helps people process information from the day and store it in their memory . The new finding suggests that this process of solidifying memories during sleep also makes it harder to suppress negative memories, which people may not want to recall.\n\nThe results suggest that people should try to resolve any arguments before going to bed and not sleep on their anger, said study co-author Yunzhe Liu, a Ph.D. student in neuroscience at University College London.\n\nIn the study, the researchers asked 73 men in England to look at 26 neutral photos of people's faces. The photos were neutral, meaning they were not associated with either positive or negative emotions . But each of these neutral photos was paired with an upsetting image, such as a photo of corpses, crying children and injured people. This way, the men learned to associate each face with an upsetting image.\n\nShortly after, the researchers showed the participants some of the photos of faces again and asked them to try to suppress, or forget, their memories of the associated unsettling images. Specifically, the people were 9 percent less likely to recall the upsetting images compared with other, baseline images that the researchers had shown the participants earlier on in the study to test their memory performance .\n\nThe researchers repeated the memory-suppression task the next day, after the participants got a night's sleep, and found that this time around, the participants reported that they had more trouble forgetting the upsetting images that had been paired with the faces. Specifically they were just 3 percent less likely to recall the upsetting images compared with other, baseline images that the researchers has shown their earlier on during the study to test their memory performance.\n\nThese results suggest that sleep may make it harder for people to forget things they'd rather not remember, the researchers said.\n\nThe researchers also scanned the people's brains during the memory-suppression task, and compared the participants' brain activity when they tried to suppress the negative memory before they slept with their memory-suppression activity after they slept.\n\nThere was a difference: When the men were asked to suppress their memory of the negative image before they slept, the hippocampus \u2014 the brain's memory center \u2014 was the part of the brain that was most involved in the task of suppressing memories. But after the men got a night's sleep, other regions of the brain became activated in the task as well, according to the study, published today (Nov. 29) in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nThis last finding may lead to a better understanding of conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder , in which people cannot suppress traumatic memories , the researchers said.\n\nOne limitation of the study was that it conducted only in men. Liu told Live Science that she thinks that the mechanisms of memory suppression before and after sleep should work the same way in women, but more research would be needed to confirm this.\n\nOriginally published on Live Science .\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.9520769119262695, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 533, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.287479787288, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 1, "mft_sum": 1, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.18761726078799199, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.0909090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/10/wildfires-break-out-across-southeast-amid-deepening-drought.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [70]}}, "headline": "Wildfires break out across Southeast amid deepening drought", "wordcount_as_scraped": 668, "date": "20161110210000", "story_content": "ATLANTA  \u2013 \u00a0Unseasonably warm dry weather has deepened a drought that's igniting forest fires across the southeastern U.S., forcing people to flee homes in the Appalachian Mountains and blanketing Atlanta in a smoky haze.\n\nThursday's national drought report shows 41.6 million people in parts of 15 southern states living in drought conditions. The worst drought is in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, but extreme drought also is spreading into the western Carolinas, and Kentucky and Tennessee had the most fires.\n\nAll but two of the 61 active large wildfires nationwide Thursday were in the Southeast, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Nearly a dozen large fires were uncontained, with 14 more breaking out Thursday alone.\n\n\"Right now we're kind of holding our own,\" said Jennifer Turner, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky's state Division of Forestry. \"We've been able to get control over some of the smaller fires.\"\n\nNearly 390 firefighters and support crews and half a dozen water-dumping helicopters were battling 20 fires in Kentucky Thursday that together have burned nearly 20,000 acres, Turner said.\n\nHumidity is so low in the normally lush Appalachians that forestry officials are bracing for more.\n\nNorth Carolina's Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency for a fourth of his state's 100 counties, to help with evacuations and provide more assets to fight the fires.\n\nAuthorities also made two arson arrests in eastern Kentucky, and citied another man for causing a brush fire while defying a burn ban. Tennessee authorities also reported arrests for arson and burning violations.\n\nFires near the southern end of the Appalachian Trail this week have sent smoky haze blowing southward over Atlanta.\n\nBans on outdoor burning were in effect across the drought zone, and in Alabama, authorities extended that ban throughout the state, where drought is choking 80 percent of the land, drying up streams and lakes and killing plants. Firefighters were battling three active wildfires in Alabama on Thursday, the latest of more than 1,100 fires that have charred nearly 12,000 acres in the last month.\n\nTuscaloosa and Birmingham have both tied or broken records for days without measurable rain; neither has had more than sprinkles since late September. And Noccalula Falls, a popular attraction on Lookout Mountain in northeast Alabama, has been bone dry for weeks.\n\n\"It's fed by Black Creek and the creek is dry. There's not even a trickle going over the falls,\" Kaila Fair, manager at the adjoining campground, said Thursday.\n\nIn mountainous western North Carolina, people living on five roads near one roaring blaze were advised to leave their homes, and residents of 38 more homes in another part of the state were told to evacuate ahead of a separate wildfire.\n\nOne of the South's largest blazes, in the Cohutta Wilderness area just south of the Georgia-Tennessee line, has grown rapidly in the past 24 hours with high winds spreading the flames. Nearly 300 people are battling that fire, which has consumed 10,000 acres of forest, the U.S. Forest Service said.\n\nAnd in the hills outside Chattanooga, firefighters were trying to save homes on both Signal Mountain and Mowbray Mountain. They may get reinforcements: The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced its reimbursement of most of the costs for one of the fires, after a request from Tennessee.\n\nDai Harris, 29, was staying in a local firehouse after being evacuated from his home near Mowbray Mountain, where a fire that seemed under control earlier in the day spiked back up.\n\n\"I'm getting very concerned, mainly for my neighbors,\" Harris said. \"I'm concerned about their houses now. I'm afraid they're not going to come home to one.\"\n\n\"I know that there's a lot of smoke, and it's covering a broad area, so I assume there's still quite a bit of flames out there,\" Harris added.\n\nDrought conditions also are persisting in parts of the Florida panhandle and portions of Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Indiana and Missouri, according to the Drought Monitor from the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.267409324646, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 651, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.032922365969999, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161110210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.53302611367127, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/13/mr-trump-our-country-is-divided-please-create-commission-for-national-healing.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3604]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 637, "scraper_regex": 703}}, "headline": "Mr. Trump, our country is divided.

Instead feelings of fragmentation and anxiety spurred by the brutal presidential campaign and its aftermath prevail. There are still millions who distrust the \"other America\", stirred by bitterly divisive political, racial, and religious rhetoric that has torn our national unity to shreds.\n\nIn his acceptance speech on election night, Donald Trump promised that he will be the President for all Americans. Achieving this lofty but critical goal may begin with a slogan but will take a much more from the new Administration. We respectfully urge the President to add one more executive order for Day One: the appointment of a National Commission for Healing.\n\nWe have become a nation of victims. Every group with a sobriquet that survives two news cycles feels that it has been wronged. From 'deplorables' to Democrats; fly-overs, free-thinkers and fundamentalists; populists and progressives \u2013 all believe that they have been ignored, disappointed, and beaten down. All of us need to listen to find a better way.\n\nWe can see the rolling eyes from the Left who will dismiss the idea as insufficient, while the right will reject it as a meaningless kumbaya exercise. But it will work, whether fully or partially, because the premise is known to be sound. Healing only begins when people are given a chance to be heard. It has worked before, and is well worth the attempt. At best, it will help calm a troubled nation. At worst, the new administration will better understand the landscape of American emotions.\n\nChaired by Vice President Mike Pence - which will give it gravitas - it should meet regularly for one year, with an option to renew. The President should name people who are trusted in large but different swaths of ideological territory. The Commission will serve as a sounding board for those with grievances; as a portal to call out the social media giants who have done too little to degrade the marketing of hate mongers; and as an echo chamber for a multitude of under-appreciated local initiatives of citizens whose daily actions should make them true American heroes.\n\nIn 2017, in a roiling America, we should have no cause to despair. We are a nation profoundly blessed with wisdom, spunk, and know-how. The commission will gather the best practices already in play, call attention to them, and reignite our optimism by showing Americans what gems we hold in hand. As Winston Churchill, no stranger to bringing a nation together, said, \"A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.\"\n\nThe Commission with equal zeal will strive to address the hatred and bigotry that is clogging the arteries of our national conversation, online and off. The existing tensions and distrust will not dissipate on their own, but will continue to grow unless challenged.\n\nWe cannot degrade extremism without including the tens of millions of Americans who rejected Mr. Trump at the polls. Many of them seek a signal from the President-Elect that his administration will be open to hear all voices. A commission on national healing will be that signal.\n\nJust shy of the end of an earlier domestic war that shocked all Americans in its length, ferocity and human toll, President Abraham Lincoln expressed ideas and a vision in his second inaugural address, one that is as valid today as it was then:\u00a0 \"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\"\n\n\n\nRabbi Abraham Cooper is associate Dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.

The fighters here insist it isn't the border of a newly independent state \u2014 but in the chaos of Iraq that could change.\n\nConstruction began in 2014, when this marked the front line between U.S.-backed Kurdish forces, known as the peshmerga, and the Islamic State group, which had swept across northern Iraq that summer, routing the army and threatening the Kurdish autonomous region.\n\nSince then, a more permanent boundary has taken shape as Kurdish aspirations for outright independence have grown. The frontier could mark the fault-line of a new conflict in Iraq once the extremists are defeated. A similar process is underway in Syria, where Syrian Kurdish forces have seized large swathes of land from IS.\n\n\"It was our front line, now it's our border, and we will stay forever,\" said peshmerga commander and business magnate Sirwan Barzani. He's among a growing number of Kurdish leaders, including his uncle, the Kurdish region's President Massoud Barzani, who say that lands taken from IS will remain in Kurdish hands.\n\nThe Kurds have been at loggerheads with the Baghdad government over the so-called disputed territories \u2014 lands stretching across northern and eastern Iraq \u2014 since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Article 140 of the Iraqi constitution says their fate should be decided by a referendum, but such a vote has yet to be held, and as the Iraqi army collapsed in 2014, the Kurds moved in.\n\nThey took control of the long-disputed northern city of Kirkuk that summer, ostensibly to protect it from IS. Since then, with the aid of U.S.-led airstrikes, the Kurds have taken territory equivalent to 50 percent of their recognized autonomous region.\n\n\"After the defeat of IS, Sunnis will dispute the Kurdish claims, the Shiites in Baghdad will dispute both the Sunni claims and the Kurdish claims, and the possibility of conflict there is real,\" said Anwar Anaid, dean of social sciences at the University of Kurdistan Hewler. \"What happens on the ground depends on the circumstances. There is a real Kurdish wish to go for independence.\"\n\nPeshmerga commander Aref Taymour said that once IS is driven from the northern city of Mosul, the Kurds will negotiate a new border with Baghdad. But he added that \"lands that have been liberated by blood, we have no intention to give them back to the federal government.\"\n\nAnother Kurdish official, Dishad Mawlod, was even more direct, describing the fortifications as the \"future borders of Kurdistan.\"\n\n\"We're not violating any international laws, nor are we occupying anyone's land,\" he said.\n\nBarzani, the regional president's nephew, said the Kurds no longer trust the Iraqi army to defend the country, after it lost nearly a third of it to IS two and a half years ago.\n\n\"Of course there will be another Daesh,\" he said, referring to IS by its Arabic acronym. \"None of the internal Iraqi issues have been resolved,\" he added, saying the Kurds \"will be ready.\" In the meantime, he hopes for talks on independence as early as next year.\n\n\"It's a bad marriage, let's get a divorce,\" he said.\n\nThe Baghdad government is staunchly opposed to Kurdish independence, and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi says he expects the Kurds to abide by an agreement that they withdraw from areas captured since the start of the Mosul operation in October.\n\n\"Some Kurdish politicians are saying otherwise. But they are not responsible people and they are not controlling events on the ground,\" al-Abadi said in an interview with The Associated Press last week.\n\nThe two sides have set the dispute aside as they work together to drive IS from Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, but the construction along the frontier is continuing. On one road south of Mosul, peshmerga fighters were building cinderblock stairways leading to offices in trailers, as guard posts were being set up further along the line.\n\nAware of the sensitivities, Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish fighters stationed along the frontier are reluctant to speak about the matter.\n\n\"You can't take pictures, and whatever you do, don't call this a border!\" a peshmerga fighter said as he came sauntering out of a checkpoint complex along the frontier. He refused to give his name.\n\nAt a nearby army position, Iraqi soldier Hussein Jassem acknowledged that \"there is a border between us and the peshmerga.\" He declined to comment further.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Zeina Karam contributed to this report from Irbil, Iraq.\n\n___\n\nFollow Brian Rohan on Twitter at www.twitter.com/brian_rohan\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.3058252334594704, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 752, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.5534552264200001, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.9946808510638299, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/26/ex-foster-kids-abuse-was-routine-in-dismembered-teens-home.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 902, "scraper_regex": 1003}}, "headline": "Ex-foster kids: Abuse was routine in dismembered teen's home", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1003, "date": "20170127000000", "story_content": "Before her torturous death, Grace Packer grew up in a hell of emotional, physical and sexual abuse, according to three children fostered by the adoptive mother who now stands charged, along with her boyfriend, of killing and dismembering the 14-year-old girl as part of a barbaric rape-murder fantasy.\n\nPolice say Sara Packer, a former county adoptions supervisor, watched as her boyfriend, Jacob Sullivan, beat and raped Grace, who was then bound, gagged and left to die in a sweltering attic. Returning the next day and finding Grace still alive, Sullivan strangled her, court documents say. They stored her body in cat litter for months, then hacked it up and dumped it in a remote area where hunters found it in October, police said.\n\nIn separate interviews with The Associated Press, the now-grown former foster daughters, all of whom lived with Sara Packer several years before Grace's rape and murder, said Sara abused her adopted daughter and clearly favored Grace's biological brother, who was also adopted.\n\n\"Her favorite child, and you could see it plain as day, had always been Gracie's brother,\" said Jade Tenezaca, now 27. \"She was more demanding on Gracie to be normal. But Gracie is not normal. Gracie had a learning disability.\"\n\nTenezaca recounted an episode that, in hindsight, seems chilling. Sara was watching the TV crime drama \"CSI\" once and casually mentioned that if she ever killed someone, she'd dismember the body and burn the pieces to ash, Tenezaca said.\n\n\"It kind of freaked me out,\" she said.\n\nSara and her husband at the time, David Packer, fostered dozens of children before David was arrested in 2010 and sent to prison for sexually assaulting Grace and a 15-year-old foster daughter at their home in Allentown, about an hour north of Philadelphia.\n\nSara Packer lost her job as an adoptions supervisor for nearby Northampton County in April 2010, and she was barred from taking in any more foster children. But she wasn't charged with a crime related to her husband's abuse, and Grace and her brother continued to live in the home.\n\nPennsylvania's child-welfare agency is investigating the circumstances around Grace's death.\n\nThe abused foster daughter, now 25, told the AP that the sexual abuse by David Packer began when she was 15, shortly after she moved into the home, and went on for years. The AP is withholding the name of the woman because she is a victim of sexual abuse.\n\nDavid moved the woman to a third-floor bedroom near the one he shared with Sara, she said. He would tie her to the bedpost and leave her there all night, she said. He would tie her to a chair and gag her. He dressed her in revealing outfits and made her go on a diet. He sexually abused her.\n\nShe said she felt she had nowhere to turn.\n\n\"After a while, I just gave up, mentally and physically. What was I supposed to do?\" said the woman, adding she twice tried killing herself while living in the home and was hospitalized.\n\nSara Packer, the woman said, had to know about the abuse. Prosecutors say Sara was aware of her husband's sexual contact with the foster daughter at least by the time the girl became an adult.\n\nThe now-grown foster daughter said she was unaware at the time that David Packer was also abusing Grace. But, she said, she did see Sara treat Grace horribly.\n\n\"Some parts of (Grace's) brain didn't work like ours, and you'd have to tell her more than a few times to do things. And Sara didn't like that. She yelled, she screamed. She hit her. She was just a big bully to her,\" the woman said.\n\nSara Packer's lawyer said he has not yet seen police or child-welfare files from the 2010 investigation of David Packer, and does not have evidence that his client was involved in wrongdoing. He noted she maintained custody of Grace and her brother after David went to prison.\n\n\"It's a good sign they investigated the family and didn't pull the kids,\" said the lawyer, John Fioravanti Jr. \"That suggests they didn't think she was involved.\"\n\nThe defense team has only just begun to investigate Sara's life and the criminal charges, Fioravanti said. Her work history in Northampton County \u2014 rising from case worker to supervisor over seven years before she was fired amid her husband's criminal investigation \u2014 suggests she was a dedicated child-care worker, he said.\n\nGiven those accomplishments, he said, \"it's just beyond belief that all of a sudden you have this monster.\"\n\nSara and David Packer divorced last year.\n\nCrystal Rodack, a third former foster daughter, spent only a few months in the Packer home. But in January 2010, she said, she looked at David Packer's phone and found photos and videos showing him sexually abusing the other foster daughter. She alerted relatives, who immediately called police.\n\nRodack said she always felt uncomfortable in the home. And, like the other former foster children, she said Grace took a back seat to her brother.\n\n\"They were really mean to Gracie in the home. She was always in trouble,\" Rodack said. \"They would hit her, they would ground her and take stuff from her and keep her in her room. I felt bad for her.\"\n\nYet the girl remained upbeat, Tenezaca said.\n\n\"Gracie was never in a bad mood. Gracie was always happy and fun, and she always wanted to be with the girls,\" she said. \"She was warm. She would open her heart to anyone and everyone. If you gave her the chance, she would be your best friend.\"\n\nTenezaca said she gave birth while still in the Packers' care. Sara Packer urged her to place the child for adoption, Tenezaca said, with Sara as the adoptive parent. Tenezaca agreed but changed her mind and kept the child.\n\n\"I wanted to do it,\" she said, \"but something in me said, 'Don't do it, don't do it, you're going to regret it.' And I'm thanking God I never did it.\"\n\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.6011559963226296, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 902, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.44975744746, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.32815964523282, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/12/cyprus-historic-venue-big-power-intrigues.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [56]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 759, "scraper_regex": 833}}, "headline": "Cyprus: A historic venue of big power intrigues", "wordcount_as_scraped": 833, "date": "20170112120000", "story_content": "LONDON \u2013 \u00a0Cyprus, a small, divided island nation in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, has played an outsized role throughout history because of its status as a jewel coveted by much bigger powers.\n\nIts strategic location between three continents \u2014 Europe, Africa and Asia \u2014 has made it a prize, economically and politically.\n\nReunification talks on the island are at a critical juncture, with top officials from Britain, Greece, and Turkey joining the meeting in Geneva on Thursday to tackle the thorny issue of security.\n\nHere's a look at Cyprus through the ages:\n\n___\n\nCYPRUS IN ANTIQUITY\n\nIn ancient times, Cyprus' location guaranteed it a role in flourishing trade routes.\n\nAlexander the Great in 333 B.C. captured the island as part of his campaign against the Persians. As the supposed birthplace of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, Cyprus also gained cult status in the Hellenic world.\n\nThe Romans invaded in 58 B.C. and held onto Cyprus for nearly five centuries, interrupted by a short period under Cleopatra of Egypt. Roman rule brought stability and the economy flourished.\n\nWhen the Roman empire split in two at the end of the 4th century, Cyprus was part of the Byzantine empire and a more chaotic era began.\n\n___\n\nCYRPUS AND THE CRUSADES\n\nFrom the middle of the 7th century, Cyprus suffered wave after wave of Arab raids before the Byzantine emperor re-established a firm grip toward the end of the millennium.\n\nIn the 12th century, Cyprus was embroiled in the Crusades, becoming a launching pad for Christian armies aiming to reclaim the Holy Lands, including those from England's King Richard I.\n\nHe eventually sold the island to fellow crusader Guy of Lusignan, the displaced king of Jerusalem, in 1192.\n\nThe Lusignan dynasty lasted for three centuries and marked a period of prosperity, with the island's elites profiting from growing trade with Venice and Genoa. Average Cypriots, however, chafed under these feudal times.\n\n___\n\nA VENETIAN POWER BASE\n\nIn 1489, the commercially minded Venetians took control of Cyprus.\n\nThey maintained the unpopular feudal system as they used the island as a defensive military base against the rising power of the Ottoman Empire, which had already captured Constantinople, the Byzantine capital.\n\nThe Venetians' struggle to prevent the Turks from attacking the island forms the backdrop to \"Othello,\" one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies.\n\nCyprus was eventually conquered by the Ottomans in 1571 after the Venetian chief Marcantonio Bragadin was captured and flayed alive in the port of Famagusta.\n\nTurkish rule would remain for about three centuries.\n\n___\n\nTHE AGE OF THE SULTANS\n\nTurkish influence in Cyprus has had long-term repercussions to this day.\n\nAlthough the Ottomans engaged with the island's Christian Orthodox representatives, its era of dominance was largely one of stagnation.\n\nIn the early part of the 19th century, the Greek independence movement started inspiring the island's ethnic Greek majority.\n\nReprisals against Greek rebels and those accused of conspiring with them fed a growing desire for union with modern Greece.\n\n___\n\nCYPRUS AND THE BRITISH EMPIRE\n\nAs the Ottoman empire faced a raft of nationalist movements, the British saw their chance to gain a foothold in Cyprus.\n\nIn 1878, the British took control of the island in exchange for military aid in the Ottomans' fight with Russia.\n\nBritain then annexed Cyprus at the start of World War I when the Ottomans sided with Germany. The island helped defend Britain's crucial trade routes to India and safeguard its interests in the Middle East.\n\nBritain transformed Cyprus, introducing its legal code and customs like driving on the left side of the road. But as the years went by, local calls for union with Greece kept growing.\n\nA guerrilla campaign forced Britain out and Cyprus became independent in 1960.\n\n___\n\nMODERN GREECE AND TURKEY\n\nIndependence didn't make things quieter in Cyprus, though Britain, Greece and Turkey as so-called 'guarantor' powers were meant to keep the peace.\n\nBy 1963, the acrimony between pro-union Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots had turned to violence.\n\nThe following year the United Nations arrived to keep the peace.\n\nMore than 50 years later, they're still there, mainly patrolling the \"Green Line\" buffer zone.\n\nCyprus split into an internationally recognized, Greek-speaking south and a breakaway Turkish-speaking north in 1974 \u2014 after Turkey invaded following a coup by supporters of union with Greece.\n\nTens of thousands became refugees. A series of attempts to reunify the island have ended in failure, most notably in 2004 when Greek Cypriots voted against a proposed peace deal.\n\n___\n\nTHE NEXT REFERENDUM IN CYPRUS\n\nNegotiators hope to make enough progress this week that the island's two sides vote this year on reunification.\n\nMaking sure there's no repeat of the events of 1974 will be central to any success.\n\nGreek Cypriots say enough territory must be returned to their control but Turkish Cypriots want to limit the amount, for telling their people to leave what they have considered home for decades is unlikely to go down well.\n\nIt's a fine balance that Britain, Greece and Turkey as well as the domestic Cyprus communities have to tread.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.0118343830108603, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 759, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.80495429464, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170112120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.82081686429513, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/05/sen-mike-enzi-time-for-congress-to-stop-binging-and-start-budgeting.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [663, 1757, 2463, 2615, 2678, 2771, 3506, 3733, 4127, 4364, 4631, 5177]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 823, "scraper_regex": 875}}, "headline": "Sen. Mike Enzi: My plan to put Congress on a 'diet' and fix our broken budget process", "wordcount_as_scraped": 875, "date": "20161207170000", "story_content": "As this year draws to a close, we are once again approaching a federal budget deadline that will likely be postponed. Over the last 40 years, since the modern budget process was established, Congress has enacted 175 temporary spending bills, formally known as 'continuing resolutions,' to avoid doing its job. It's time to change the way Congress does business.\n\nThe November election results showed that hardworking taxpayers are eager for real change. With a new president taking office on January 20th, Congress has an opportunity \u2013 and responsibility \u2013 to get back to work. \u00a0\n\nThe first step must be fixing America's broken budget process to provide our nation with a responsible fiscal blueprint and help guide our spending decisions now and into the future. As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, this will be one of my top priorities in the new congress.\n\nWe are a nation on course for a fiscal disaster, because when it comes to spending money, Congress is like a binge eater. We don't want to start our diet until right AFTER the next dessert. That attitude has led to a mammoth, oversized national debt that, left unchecked, will crush the prosperity of future generations.\n\nWe must start spending within our means and establish healthy fiscal habits. Unfortunately, America's broken budget process makes it easy for Congress to spend without ever checking its fiscal waist line.\n\nCurrently, only thirty percent of the national budget is annually distributed to federal agencies and programs by Congress. This money funds the activities that most people would associate with good government, such as national defense, education, and infrastructure spending.\u00a0\n\nWe must pass spending bills to fund these government activities every year, forcing a public debate about where taxpayer dollars should be spent.\n\nIn fact, this is the portion of the budget that attracts the most congressional scrutiny and debate, and there are limits in place that make it very difficult to spend more than what's allotted. But it is not growing rapidly and is not the cause of our unsustainable fiscal course.\n\nThe real culprit is the other seventy percent of the federal budget that is spent automatically, without regular congressional action or review.\n\nIn just 15 years, it will consume ALL government revenues, as debt interest payments and entitlements continue to grow rapidly.\u00a0 There are no effective limits to the amount that can be spent on this side of the budget, at least until this spending drives America into bankruptcy.\u00a0\n\nThis is how the budget process makes it easy to spend money.\u00a0 There is regular review and strict limits on the small and shrinking portion of the budget.\u00a0 But the much larger automatic spending programs are not regularly reviewed and can grow almost without limit.\n\nTo make matters worse, the historically low interest rates that America has relied on to pay its debt are poised to surge, according to the latest signals from the Federal Reserve. When these rates rise, we can expect to spend more every year on interest payments for these loans than we spend on national defense.\n\nThe Senate Budget Committee has been working on reforms that would fix America's broken budget process. Many of these reforms strengthen the congressional budget, the only existing tool we have that forces Congress to examine all spending and revenues, including automatic spending, over a ten-year period.\u00a0 This budgeting process should be easier to adopt and harder to ignore. Congress can start by reducing the needless political hurdles to passing a budget and making it harder to ignore overspending once Congress agreed to it. \u00a0\n\nThe congressional budget is easily ignored in the Senate because it takes the same number of votes in the Senate to waive a budget violation that it does to overcome filibuster and pass a bill. The fiscal year 2016 budget was tossed aside in less than 5 weeks. Our rules should make it harder to pass a bill that busts the congressional budget by requiring more votes to waive the violation.\u00a0\n\nWe must also create new rules to ensure Congress passes its annual spending measures on time. The current process has been completed on time only four times in the last 40 years, and the last time it was completed on time was in 1998.\u00a0\n\nObviously this year is no exception to the rule. Congress should set aside specific floor time only for consideration of spending bills and enact legislation establishing a two-year spending cycle, so that it has more time to review spending and complete its work.\u00a0 It should also enact Senator Portman's legislation that would end government shutdowns to prevent our annual, end-of-year spending crises.\n\nThese reforms and others would begin to create healthy fiscal habits that would force Congress to recognize and begin to address the daunting fiscal challenges that face our country.\n\nI will continue to tirelessly work to get as many of these budget reforms as possible enacted in the new Congress. It's time to take seriously the crisis that is threatening the future financial solvency of this country.\u00a0\n\nThe American people have spoken, and we owe it to them to put politics aside and get back to work.\n\n\n\nRepublican Mike Enzi represents Wyoming in the United States Senate where he serves as chairman of the Budget Committee.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.6877636909484899, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 823, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.71044433838, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.9720534629404621, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/22/suspect-in-killing-kansas-mom-kidnapping-baby-was-arrested-in-july-attack.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [93, 351]}}, "headline": "Suspect in killing of Kansas mom, kidnapping baby was arrested in July attack", "wordcount_as_scraped": 534, "date": "20161123010000", "story_content": "WICHITA, Kan. \u2013 \u00a0A Dallas woman accused of killing a Kansas woman and kidnapping her newborn daughter was arrested in July for allegedly threatening another woman with a knife and trying to hold that woman's two daughters for ransom.\n\nAdriana Portillo told The Wichita Eagle\u00a0that she couldn't believe that Yesenia Sesmas had been released after the July arrest. She found out Monday that Sesmas had been arrested in last week's killing of another Wichita woman, Laura Abarca-Nogueda, and the abduction of Abarca-Nogueda's 6-day-old daughter, Sophia. The girl was retrieved safely from Sesmas' Dallas home Saturday during a pre-dawn raid and reunited with family.\n\nSesmas, 34, remained jailed in Texas on Tuesday. The complaint detailing the charges against her in Kansas won't be revealed until she appears in court there. The extradition process could take up to 90 days.\n\nIn a jailhouse interview with Dallas-Fort Worth TV station KUVN, Sesmas admitted that she killed Abarca-Nogueda but said she didn't mean to. She said Abarca-Nogueda had reneged on an agreement to give her her newborn daughter, and that she threatened Abarca-Nogueda with a gun that accidentally discharged, killing her.\n\nSesmas moved from Wichita to Dallas sometime since July. Portillo told the Eagle that she had been friends with Sesmas for years, but knew her as Patricia Hernandez. She said Sesmas offered to give her a TV and some clothing she wasn't taking with her to Dallas, and that she invited her and her daughters, ages 10 and 3, to collect the things from her basement.\n\nPortillo, who was eight months pregnant at the time, said things got strange and violent in Sesmas' basement. Portillo said Sesmas had a knife and duct tape and that she took away her cellphone, telling Portillo to tape up her girls. She said Sesmas demanded $10,000 and said she had two cohorts who were friends with Portillo's husband and who thought he could afford to pay that much to get the girls back.\n\nPortillo said she told Sesmas they didn't have the money, and that she and Sesmas then began fighting. During the struggle, Portillo's older daughter managed to get her phone back and call police. Portillo said she hit Sesmas in the eye, and that she and her girls ran outside and got into their van. Sesmas ran after them and tried getting in, eventually managing to grab the keys and throw them. Police then arrived and arrested Sesmas.\n\nRecords show that Sesmas was booked into a Sedgwick County jail in July on suspicion of aggravated battery, aggravated kidnapping and kidnapping.\n\nGeorgia Webb, office manager for the Sedgwick County district attorney's office, said Sesmas bonded out of jail after that July arrest, but she wouldn't comment when asked whether formal charges were filed at that time.\n\nSedgwick County Sheriff Jeff Easter said Thursday that Sesmas didn't show up to an Aug. 9 court appearance and that his office faxed a warrant to authorities in Dallas asking for help in finding her.\n\nMelinda Urbina, spokeswoman for the Dallas County sheriff's office, said Sesmas remained jailed there under an immigration hold and the Sedgwick County arrest warrants related to her July arrest.\n\nUrbina said she didn't know if Sesmas has an attorney.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.65529012680054, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 531, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.05016160448, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161123010000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.461393596986821, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/01/five-ways-trump-can-change-conversation-about-police.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [539, 1553, 1637, 3641, 5553]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 808, "scraper_regex": 880}}, "headline": "Five ways Trump can change the conversation about police", "wordcount_as_scraped": 880, "date": "20161201150000", "story_content": "Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in Fox News Opinion on November 23.\n\nAmerica has endured nearly eight years of bitterly divisive politics and policies regarding law enforcement. President Obama's contentious actions and rhetoric only served to drive a wedge between three quarter million law officers and the communities they serve.\n\nIt hasn't been impossible to see instances where a police officer acted in a manner that brought doubt and suspicion on their\u00a0department. But the misguided narrative that linked the actions of a very few to an entire profession has generated a wave of mistrust against law officers and gave a voice to hateful, anti-cop groups like Black Lives Matter.\n\nIn fact, were it to be fully and fairly reported, we would know of exponentially more acts of police bravery, sacrifice and heroism than the comparatively few questionable shootings of citizens.\n\nToo often in the media we see a singular theme when it comes to law enforcement \u2013 that the police are racist, over-militarized Neanderthals who sign on to abuse the rights of citizens.\n\nBut even the spin of the left only goes so far. Over a year ago, the Washington Post began collecting information on every fatal shooting by police. In doing so, they undercut their own assumptions when the 2015 tally showed just a small percentage of \"questionable\" incidents involving unarmed citizens who may not have presented a serious threat.\n\nWith that predicate, here are five recommendations for\u00a0President-elect Trump to guide him along a far different path than his predecessor:\u00a0\n\n1. Put it in perspective. Hundreds of thousands of police officers engage in tens of millions of citizen contacts every year, the vast majority of which are entirely routine and uneventful. By comparison, police use of deadly force is extraordinary and fatalities at the hands of police are anything but an epidemic.\n\nIn fact, the risk of any citizen ending up in a fatal encounter with the police starts with a decimal point followed by several zeros. Comparatively, the risk of death from homicide, falls, traffic accidents, accidental poisonings, suicide, or medical mistakes are each exponentially higher.\n\nAccording to Gallup reports, 76 percent of Americans say they have \"a great deal\" of respect for police in their area, up 12 points from last year. That's a pretty good start.\n\n2. Keep your thumb off the scale. President Obama's background in law and national platform often led him to weigh in prematurely, and inappropriately, on law enforcement matters that were nascent or where fact-finding was ongoing.\n\nDuring incidents involving Cambridge police, Treyvon Martin, Ferguson, the FBI's pending investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails; his comments came before investigators had completed their work.\n\nThe premature comments amounted to personal opinion, yet they eroded at the trust and respect for those working to complete thorough, unbiased inquiries that might, or might not, lead to criminal charges. Know what we know; exercise caution in commenting on what we don't.\n\n3. Data matters. The lack of comprehensive data available on crime and punishment in this country creates an opportunity for those who seek benefit from a false narrative.\n\nSolid intelligence based in fact, whether from investigators on the ground or from validated collection and analysis systems, can guide future decisions and investments and fill the voids now filled with speculation and opinion about police motives and actions. Strengthen data collection and analysis systems that would truly inform. \u00a0\n\n4. Use your words and actions wisely. Build up rather than break down and recognize that the imagery of where you go, what you do and who you're with has great power.\n\nWe saw this as the president aligned himself with groups that were anti-police during the height of the debate. Building enduring coalitions locally or nationally includes recognition that black lives do matter, just like blue lives, and, yes, all lives; however, groups that presume their own viewpoints are only those worthy of consideration should be rejected.\n\n5. Invest, invest, invest. In too many places, America's police are expected to do far too much with far too little. From Philly to Cleveland to Oakland, patrol officers start their shift with 911 calls stacked in their queue, riding from crisis to crisis with little time to invest in developing community relationships that might later flower into pockets of trust.\n\nToo large a proportion of their encounters will come emotionally disturbed persons who defy treatment and police direction \u2013 the product of an ineffectual, fragmented mental health system.\n\nOthers will come from youth and adults who failed to attend school or learned little as a result of poor education systems and families lacking discipline.\n\nThe new administration should invest in hiring, training, equipping, and leading police officers across the country.\n\nCommunity policing, crisis intervention and de-escalation training, and tools like body cameras are only beneficial if the right training and leadership is behind them.\n\nAmerica's policing and criminal justice systems are at a crossroads. The president-elect should take a serious look at mistakes of the past and work to build an infrastructure that would restore trust and confidence in our law enforcement and increase faith in a system that encounters, treats, diverts, deters, and punishes appropriately.\n\n\n\nRon Hosko is president of the\u00a0Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, and former assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.87840676307678, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 808, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.7482778414699998, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161201150000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.58910891089109, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/11/21/childhood-cancer-survivors-may-not-get-needed-adult-care.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3994]}}, "headline": "Childhood cancer survivors may not get needed adult care", "wordcount_as_scraped": 646, "date": "20161121140000", "story_content": "Children who've had cancer may be more likely to receive the follow-up care they need in adulthood if their parents take the time to teach them how to interact with doctors while they're young, a recent study suggests.\n\n\"Parents who both act as a support for their children as they age and encourage their young adults to take responsibility for their health, for example talking to providers and understanding their health and health care, can provide a valuable balance of support and promotion of self-advocacy that is so important for young adults to stay engaged in their care,\" said lead study author Dr. Dava Szalda.\n\nToo often, adult survivors of childhood cancer don't get appropriate care even when they do get regular checkups, Szalda, a researcher at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, added by email.\n\n\"They may be seeing medical teams of some sort, but aren't getting risk-based care which takes into account their cancer history and treatment to create a long-term follow-up plan or to provide care that addresses risk related to their prior treatment,\" Szalda said.\n\nWhile plenty of previous research has documented gaps in adult follow-up care for childhood cancer survivors, the current study focused on risk factors that parents and doctors of these children may be able to change.\n\nResearchers examined data on 80 young adult survivors of childhood cancer who had finished treatment for their tumors at least five years earlier.\n\nParticipants were about 28 years old on average, and ranged in age from 23 to 36.\n\nMost were diagnosed with cancer at around age 10, though some were babies or as old as 22.\n\nRoughly 39 percent had leukemia, a cancer of the blood cells, and about 28 percent had lymphoma, or malignancies in the immune system.

And the wait continues as we muddle through the remaining days inundated with debates, half-truths, and mainstream media nonsense.\n\nOur nation is divided folks, and not to be a Debbie Downer but our nation will remain divided after the wait ends November on 8. \n\nWhen the votes are counted and the returns are reported half the country will be disappointed, perhaps disappointed is an understatement, while the other half of the country will be delighted, again an understatement. \n\nGiven this truth, what is our faith-based response to the wait of this monumental election?\n\nAs people of faith, we stand in church together. We share conversations over the dinner table, on the ball field, and at the bank. \n\nWe also stand on opposite sides of the proverbial political aisle. Our lives intersect before the election and will intersect after the election. \n\nIt's imperative we work to close this divide. This is only possible by remembering the election may change who sits in the Oval Office, but it doesn't change Who sits on the throne.\n\nDaniel, one of the exiles from Israel, shouted a glorious and timeless a statement about God we can anchor our hearts to for such a time as this. \n\nAfter interpreting King Nebuchadnezzar's dream Daniel says, \"He [God] controls the course of world events; He [God] removes kings and sets up other kings,\" (Daniel 2:21a NLT). \n\nA quick review of the Old Testament kings will demonstrate God's divine and intentional appointment of bad kings as well as good kings. Daniel was under the authority of two \"bad kings.\" God revealed Himself to these kings and used them protect His people. \n\nIt isn't about whom our leader is, it is about Who our God is, We can trust God's control of world events, and forbid the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to divide our nation further. \n\nThis truth can give us peace and the ability to rise up and carry the banner of unity as a model for the world to see.\n\nIn addition to trusting God to raise up and depose our leader when should vote. Not voting is not an option. \n\nIn our study of the Revolutionary War, my son and I have watched the historical accounts of our fight for freedom depicted on the Fox New Series, \"Legends and Lies.\" I've been reminded of the incredible sacrifice men and families made so that we can be nation of democracy and have the privilege to vote. Not voting is simple a mockery of the blood-stained battlefields.\n\nOn November 8, my candidate may win. On the other hand, your candidate may win.\u00a0 No matter which candidate wins, we can't let America lose by remaining divided. \n\nBelievers must hold to the truth of Daniel 2:21 and fervently pray for the leader of our country as we wait\u2026 for the next election.\n\n\n\nWendy is the author of Wait and See: Finding Peace in God's Pauses and Plans.

But significant vulnerabilities remain.\n\nThe attack that killed five people Friday at the Fort Lauderdale airport raised concerns about how to further protect travelers and what place firearms have in U.S. airports.\n\nAuthorities say Iraq war veteran Esteban Santiago flew in from Alaska, retrieved a handgun from his checked luggage, went to a bathroom to load it and then returned to the baggage claim area to open fire.\n\n\"There's no question we need to review not only the question of whether people should be able to travel with their firearms even if they're in checked baggage, but I think we need to take a hard look at the security around baggage claim areas, and not just leave it at that,\" said U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, whose district includes the airport.\n\nTransportation security and law enforcement experts say the baggage claim area remains one of the most vulnerable parts of the airport. Security is lighter and large numbers of people move in and out quickly.\n\n\"What went wrong yesterday ... is that baggage claim is the softest of soft targets. I mean an elementary school is harder to get into than a baggage claim at an airport,\" said Chris Grollnek, a former law enforcement officer who specializes in security issues, especially involving active shooter situations.\n\nIndeed, he notes, it's more difficult to get out of the baggage claim area where at least a minimal security presence screens people leaving to make sure they haven't taken someone else's luggage than it is to enter the area.\n\nAfter virtually every terror attack or attempted attack, authorities have issued new restrictions: requiring passengers to remove their shoes to expose any explosive material and limiting the amount of liquid in carry-on bags. But experts say the public areas of an airport remain vulnerable, because the focus of security is devoted to screening passengers to keep their flights safe.\n\nJust in the past year suicide bombers targeted ticket and terminal areas in Brussels and Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nThe only way to prevent such attacks, Grollnek and other experts said, is to ensure the wrong people don't get guns and to encourage the general public to alert authorities if they believe a friend or family member is acting erratically. He likened it to farmers who were enlisted in the Civil Air Patrol to spot potential illegal activity while they were in the air in crop dusters.\n\nFlorida is one of six states that restrict firearms at the airport, declaring it a \"gun-free\" zone, along with schools and government meetings. Before the shooting, state legislators sought to relax those restrictions, arguing they prevent people from protecting themselves from attack. Opponents of those efforts, said having guns there would make them more dangerous. Gun-free zones at airports still allow for travelers to bring their firearms to the airport to be checked, and then retrieve it once they land.\n\n\"Yesterday should serve as a reminder that guns have no place in such areas in our communities,\" said Michelle Gajda, with Florida Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.\n\nBut Kevin Michalowski, executive editor of Concealed Carry magazine, said gun-free zones give a false sense of security. \"What they do is provide a safe space for someone who decides to commit mass murder to go ahead and do it without anyone getting in his or her way,\" he said.\n\nMark Lea, 53, had just flown in from Minnesota and was in the baggage claim area when the shooting began. He helped evacuate people and saw the shooter. Lea said he has a concealed carry permit but did not have his weapon with him because he was going on a cruise. He said he would have shot the man had he had his own weapon.\n\n\"Yes, by all means,\" said Lea. \"I would've shot him and not even thought twice about it.\"\n\nTransportation security experts say the safe transport of firearms and gun-free zones present a balancing act between ensuring the public's safety without trampling on constitutional rights.\n\nAn easy solution might be to require travelers to ship their firearms ahead of time, said Mary Schiavo, former Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation. But then you would run afoul of constitutional issues involving the right to interstate travel and the firearm owners protection act. Another option might be to restrict ammunition from being transported on planes, but that is not without its own constitutional concerns, she said.\n\n\"It's a knotty problem,\" Schiavo said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Tamara Lush and Curt Anderson contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nLisa Marie Pane can be followed on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/lisamariepane .\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.81173586845398, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 735, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.010732283459999, "HarmVirtue": 17, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170108180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.57823129251701, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/20/trump-secures-victory-in-electoral-college-as-bid-to-flip-electors-flops.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [426, 657, 966, 1018, 1491, 2080, 2716, 4110]}}, "headline": "Trump secures victory in Electoral College, as bid to flip electors flops", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1101, "date": "20161220070000", "story_content": "Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote on Monday and secured his election as the 45th president of the United States, as the latest \u2013 and perhaps last \u2013 stop-Trump movement failed to gain traction in state capitals.\n\nA fervent push by anti-Trump forces to persuade electors to defect had turned the normally mundane civic procedure into high drama.\u00a0\n\nBut Trump easily surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win, as representatives tabbed to cast ballots in accordance with their states' Nov. 8 decision mostly adhered to the election results. After all the states had voted,\u00a0Trump finished with 304 votes and Clinton had 227. \n\nTexas put Trump over the top, despite two Republican electors casting protest votes.\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence afterward tweeted \"congratulations\" to his running mate while saying he was \"honored & humbled\" to be officially elected the next vice president.\u00a0\n\nRepublican National Committee Co-Chair Sharon Day\u00a0urged Trump's detractors to stop fighting his election, now that his victory is affirmed.\n\n\"This historic election is now officially over and I look forward to President-elect Trump taking the oath of office in January,\" she said in a statement. \"For the good of the country, Democrats must stop their cynical attempts to undermine the legitimacy of this election, which Donald Trump won decisively in the Electoral College with more votes than any Republican since 1988.\"\u00a0\n\nElector antics were few and far between throughout the day, with most the disruptions occurring on the Democratic side. A Democratic elector in Maine tried to vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders, but switched to Clinton after it was ruled improper. Another who tried to vote for Sanders in Minnesota was replaced; a Colorado elector who tried to back Ohio Gov. John Kasich likewise was replaced. One of the biggest deviations was in Washington state, where three electors voted for Colin Powell and one voted for \"Faith Spotted Eagle;\" the remaining eight went to Clinton, the state's winner. \u00a0\n\nIt marked the first time in four decades the state's electors broke from the popular vote. Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman vowed to work with the state attorney general and charge the four unfaithful electors with a violation of Washington state civil law. Such violations carry a fine up to $1,000.\n\nWith Trump's win now secured, a joint session of Congress is scheduled for Jan. 6 to certify the results.\n\nTrump's clear Electoral College victory could serve to deter any further last-ditch efforts to effectively nullify his November win and prevent his inauguration, though the battle may shift next to his Cabinet picks. \u00a0\n\nFew expected the \"faithless elector\" push to imperil Trump's victory on Monday.\n\nOnly one Republican elector \u2013 Texas' Chris Suprun \u2013 publicly stated he would vote for an alternative candidate. (He backed Kasich, while another Texas elector used his ballot to vote for former congressman Ron Paul.) More than three dozen Republicans would have had to abandon Trump to complicate his path to the presidency.\n\nBut GOP electors still faced immense pressure -- with some even receiving threats -- from Trump foes in the run-up to Monday's Electoral College vote. Those urging disorder in state capitals often cited Clinton's popular-vote win, by roughly 2.6 million votes, over Trump in November.\n\nCelebrities made public appeals to electors to use the arcane process to upend Trump's victory, as some Democratic electors tried to persuade their Republican counterparts to defect. Reports that U.S. intelligence officials determined Russia interfered in the election to boost Trump \u2013 findings disputed by Trump himself \u2013 only fueled efforts to wield the Electoral College vote as a political circuit-breaker.\n\nAs electors met, thousands of protesters descended on state capitals Monday in one last push to convince Trump voters to change their minds.\n\nIn Arizona, dozens of protesters gathered outside the meeting site, marching around the Capitol mall and carrying signs that said, \"Stop Trump.\"\u00a0More than 200 demonstrators gathered at Pennsylvania's Capitol, chanting, \"No treason, no Trump!\"\n\nBoth states, and dozens of others, cast their electoral votes for Trump anyway.\n\nIn Mississippi, Gov. Phil Bryant dismissed attempts to sway Republican electors.\n\n\"This idea \u2026 that we want to change the electors' minds who have been dedicated to Donald Trump very early in the process I think is just misguided,\" he said.\n\nIf nothing else, the furor over Monday's proceedings has served to re-acquaint Americans with a process that few pay attention to every four years.\n\nThe Electoral College was devised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. It was a compromise between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted no public input.\n\nThe Electoral College has 538 members, with the number allocated to each state based on how many representatives it has in the House plus one for each senator. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress.\n\nTo be elected president, the winner must get at least half plus one -- or 270 electoral votes. Most states give all their electoral votes to whichever candidate wins that state's popular vote. Maine and Nebraska award them by congressional district.\n\nAfter a joint session of Congress certifies the results on Jan. 6, the next president will be sworn in on Jan. 20.\n\nTrump already is nearly done naming his Cabinet appointees, as he prepares for confirmation hearings and the inauguration ceremonies, in addition to his first 100 days agenda.\n\nDespite the transition process being well underway, Republican electors said they were deluged with emails, phone calls and letters urging them not to support the billionaire businessman in the days and weeks leading up to Monday's proceedings. Many of the emails were part of coordinated campaigns.\n\n\"The letters are actually quite sad,\" said Lee Green, a Republican elector from North Carolina. \"They honestly believe the propaganda. They believe our nation is being taken over by a dark and malevolent force.\"\n\nWirt A. Yerger Jr., a Republican elector in Mississippi, said, \"I have gotten several thousand emails asking me not to vote for Trump. I threw them all away.\"\n\nArizona elector Robert Graham told Fox News on Saturday that the state's 11 electors received hundreds of thousands of emails telling them not to vote for Trump and that he's received information that some of the other 10 have been followed or have received a death threat.\n\n\"It's out of hand when you have such \u2026 a small group of people that is pushing so hard against millions if not hundreds of millions of people who still appreciate this whole system,\" said Graham, chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. \"The Electoral College is part of the Constitution.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.64644718170166, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1062, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.4052284646, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.2598870056497202, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/30/93-year-old-world-war-ii-hero-heres-why-911-law-is-all-wrong-for-our-military.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [87, 359, 728, 934, 942, 975, 1319, 1438, 1960, 2030, 2503, 2641, 3371, 3787, 4281, 4436, 4454, 4646, 4647, 4671, 4679, 5048, 5088, 5092, 5114, 5435, 5596, 6024, 6066, 6239, 6362, 6555, 6589, 6597, 6817, 6857]}}, "headline": "93-year-old World War II hero: Here's why the '9/11 law' is all wrong for our military", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1163, "date": "20161130210000", "story_content": "A\u00a0couple of years ago, honored as keynote speaker at a gala hosted by the stunning Pritzker Military Museum and Library in Chicago, I asked those assembled a question that I never stopped asking myself upon receiving this nation's highest honor, the Medal of Honor: Why me?\u00a0 \n\nFor, over the course of my service in Iwo Jima during World War II, there were men around me whom I had always thought gave so much more to the war effort\u2014to our fight for freedom--and of those men, too many among them who never returned home, never got to experience once again the country that led the world living the values for which they sacrificed themselves.\u00a0 \n\nWhat the United States saw in my wartime actions as being worthy of this great recognition, I chose to take a step further in seeing myself as but the envoy to and embodiment of the memory of those true\u00a0Marines\u00a0I knew so well and miss so much.\u00a0\n\nSince then it has been my most cherished hope that new generations of Americans will learn to appreciate what is really, ultimately, involved in appreciating a country such as ours; what values have gone into creating out of this magnificent experiment in democratic ideals born from a revolution, the greatest global power in human history.\u00a0 \n\nWhen anyone, or anything, threatens the erosion of those fundamental values, it is then time, once again, to fight.\u00a0 \n\nOften, at those times, this fight does not consist of physical battlegrounds and artillery, but, instead, of a war of ideas--one in which the best weaponry is intellectual integrity, reasoned principles, and the wisdom of history.\n\nWhen hearing of the legislation known as \"JASTA\"\u2014the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act\", or \"9/11 Bill\" as it is called--enacted into law by Congress this past September, my first thought went to the Gold Star families in this country, some of whom I have had the honor to meet.\u00a0 \n\nIt is very difficult for me to fathom what our members of Congress\u00a0were thinking in creating a law that will have as its ultimate outcome the placing of our servicemen and women\u2014and all of the civilian diplomatic and intelligence-gathering support that military personnel will need\u2014at litigious risk around the world. These individuals will henceforth be subject to the legal whims of countries who will want to extract God knows what sums from us by conveniently accusing us of 'acts of terror'.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with this law, JASTA\u00a0allows private, individual litigation against foreign governments in U.S. courts based on allegations that such countries' actions abroad\u00a0made them responsible for terrorism-related injuries on U.S soil. \n\nIt was written with the events of 9/11 in mind, and was intended\u2014if not explicitly\u2014as an action against Saudi Arabia. But the implications of the law are far broader and universal. Above all, it sets in motion the erosion of the traditional idea of sovereign immunity\u2014the internationally recognized principle of diplomatic protection against the legal jurisdiction of other states.\n\nWhat will now happen is that other countries will enact similar legislation in response, and much of that will be directed against the United States\u2014in fact, it's already happening. What will begin to happen is that the United States will be put on trial before the whole world.\u00a0\n\n As powerful as we are, there is no stopping the immense international legal chaos brought about by such a law, with trial lawyers everywhere\u2014many of them here--ready to take advantage of lawsuits that will easily hover in the billions of dollars, in each and every case.\n\nWe have been in three wars since 1991. We are currently fighting a complex war against terrorism. We are dealing with new threats every day.\u00a0\n\nThe United States funds and equips numerous counterterrorism and intelligence-gathering units around the world. These are complex situations, and they are not without their controversies and difficulties. But we pursue such operations because we must; because our own future depends on it.\n\nWhen I think back at my own experience, it is difficult for me to conceive of the idea of being told that my military engagements at Iwo Jima would one day be used against me, used against my country.\u00a0 \n\nIt is inconceivable that I, as an American, would be told that my acts were motivated by a terrorist inclination. It is unthinkable that as an American\u00a0Marine crossing a\u00a0network of reinforced concrete pillboxes, buried mines and black, volcanic sands, that my intention was not to fight a hostile nation that had declared war on us, but to terrify a population.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n When I and my fellow\u00a0Marines\u00a0were subject to hours under fire at a time and we prepared demolitions with flame throwers to stop the bayonets thrust at us by destroying them with bursts of flame\u2026when I think back on those events, and consider what would it be like to have to be hauled in before the global court of public opinion to explain my actions, I have to ask myself if our Congress members\u00a0have any historical awareness of what a\u00a0war\u00a0for freedom is about.\u00a0 \n\nI must ask if they realize what it means to position our military and civilian apparatus in engagements the world over for the very sake of that freedom.\n\nIt is universally accepted by all who call themselves human that the civilian carnage that comes with war should be avoided as much as possible, and at all costs.\u00a0 \n\nWe also know that war is ugly, devastating, and takes a toll on life in a way that is, at times, as spiritually annihilating as it is physically destructive.\u00a0U.S. counterterrorism strikes have been a successful component of our own counterterrorism efforts, but these strikes do occasionally cause civilian casualties. \n\nYet to expose the United States to lawsuits in foreign courts because of these actions, or the actions of those local groups on whom we must often rely, will only open the door to intrusive lawyers seeking billions of dollars of claims against the U.S. government.\u00a0 \n\nThis is not a path we want to go down.\u00a0Furthermore, we should ask members of Congress to pass laws that would exempt our service members from lawsuits for actions taken while following orders during time of war.\u00a0\n\nNo sane person can possibly detach his- or herself from the anguish on the part of victims of terror and their families.\u00a0 But to pass a law that, in essence, tells the world that they may drain from us the very resources that we have put into fighting for freedom on the world's behalf, is not the America I know.\u00a0 \n\nNor is it that of those fellow\u00a0Marines\u00a0of mine in whose memory I have always worn my Medal, but in whose honor we as a country remember Freedom.\n\n\n\nHershel \"Woody\" Williams is a retired United States Marine and Medal of Honor recipient for his actions in the\u00a0Battle of Iwo Jima during World War ll.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.65615141391754, "HarmVice": 16, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1115, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.04938354895, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 62, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161130210000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 5.6363636363600005, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 12, "pct_mft_words": 5.560538116591929, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/01/18/can-cannabis-oil-help-heal-wounds.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Can cannabis oil help heal wounds?

Studies have suggested that marijuana may work to treat cancer patients' pain .\n\nMuch more research is needed to know whether medical cannabis oil may have a wound-healing effect. But the man's case \"really validates what has been known for thousands of years about the utility of cannabinoids in so many different areas,\" said Dr. Vincent Maida, an associate professor in the Division of Palliative Care at the University of Toronto, who treated the man.\n\n\"Ancient cultures used cannabis extracts on wounds,\" Maida said.\n\nThe 44-year-old man went to see Maida at a palliative-care clinic in Toronto in the spring of 2016 for the treatment of pain caused by a malignant wound in his right cheek. The man had been diagnosed with oral cancer three years earlier, and despite having the tumor surgically removed as well as undergoing radiation and chemotherapy for his condition, the cancer returned. The man had chosen, two years before his visit to Maida's clinic, to forgo any further treatments for his cancer, according to the report. (Palliative care generally involves only treatments to reduce pain.)\n\nThe man had tried taking opioid medications , but was still having severe pain in his cheek. In addition, he was experiencing side effects from those medicines, such as drowsiness and constipation, the man told Maida. He asked Maida to prescribe medical marijuana to treat his pain.\n\nThe doctor prescribed vaporized medical marijuana for the man, which the man then used for the next few months. The marijuana seemed to help alleviate the pain significantly, and allowed the man to reduce the doses of opioids he was taking. However, the wound in his cheek grew and the cancer eventually eroded through his cheek, creating a hole, which prevented the man from continuing to use vaporized marijuana.\n\nThe man then asked Maida for a prescription for medical cannabis oil, which he could apply directly to his wound. The man used the oil four times daily for about a month.\n\nHe found that his wound stopped growing, and shrank by a small amount, about 5 percent, over the next month. The man said he experienced pain relief starting about 10 to 15 minutes after he applied the oil to the wound, which lasted for about 2 hours after application.\n\nHowever, about a month after the man started using the oil, he was admitted to a hospital because his overall condition had deteriorated. He died from cancer three weeks later, according to the report.\n\nThe new report showing that the cannabis oil seemed to work for treating the man's wound \"is really interesting,\" said Dr. Anita Gupta, the vice chair of the Division of Pain Medicine at Drexel College of Medicine in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the report.\n\nSo far, no actual studies have looked at using cannabis oil for wound treatment in people. One study, done on human intestine cells growing in lab dishes, suggested that cannabinoids may enhance the closure of wounds .\n\nThough it is not clear why cannabis oil may have had a wound-healing effect in this case, one possible reason might be that the oil reduced inflammation , Gupta said.\n\nHowever, she noted that more research is needed to examine whether cannabis oil may have any robust benefit in large numbers of patients with significant wounds.\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.992867469787599, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 601, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.4473609501599998, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.66222961730449, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/07/small-percentage-hate-crimes-aimed-at-whites.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [67]}}, "headline": "Small percentage of hate crimes aimed at whites", "wordcount_as_scraped": 736, "date": "20170108000000", "story_content": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2013 \u00a0The horrific beating of a mentally disabled white man in Chicago by four black assailants broadcast on social media is highlighting anti-white hate crimes at a time of increased racial strife in the United States.\n\nBut federal statistics and experts say anti-white incidents remain a smaller percentage of overall hate crimes. Anti-black hate crimes are still the largest number of cases.\n\nAccording to the 2015 FBI hate crime statistics, the latest available, there were 613 anti-white-related crimes out of 5,850 total cases. That's around 10.5 percent of all reported hate crimes, and within the yearly average, federal numbers show.\n\nBy comparison, the FBI reports there were 1,745 anti-black hate crimes or about 30 percent of all reported incidents. Jews were the most targeted religious group that year and were victims of 11 percent of all hate crimes. It's not clear how many anti-Jewish hate crime victims also may have been attacked because of their race.\n\nThat data also suggested that blacks and Jews remain disproportionally targets of hate crimes compared to their population as opposed to whites. African-Americans are only 13 percent of the U.S. population, while non-Hispanic whites are 61 percent.\n\nThe FBI defines a hate crime as a \"criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.\" Filing reports for the federal count is voluntary, but guidelines call for reports to be submitted even if they list zero hate crimes.\n\nEven then, experts say the FBI data on hate crimes isn't a full picture since anti-black cases are skewed lower by the lack of reporting participation by some southern law enforcement agencies.\n\nSome large Florida cities, like Miami, reported no hate crimes to the FBI in 2015, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State University. \"I doubt that cities as diverse as those had no hate crimes,\" he said.\n\nIn Chicago, two men and two women \u2014 all black \u2014 are facing hate crime charges in connection with the brutal beating of a mentally disabled white man that was streamed on Facebook Live. The video shows the victim is tied up and the suspects are making racial slurs and references to his mental capacity, Chicago Police Commander Kevin Duffin said.\n\nThe suspects are accused of forcing the victim to drink toilet water and kiss the floor, stuffing a sock into his mouth, taping his mouth shut and binding his hands with a belt.\n\nThe 18-year-old victim, who is from a Chicago suburb, suffers from schizophrenia and attention-deficit disorder, authorities said.\n\nThe victim also was taunted with profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nEighteen-year-olds Brittany Covington, Tesfaye Cooper and Jordan Hill, and 24-year-old Tanishia Covington also face kidnapping and battery charges in connection with the attack.\n\nThe case heightened political tensions on social media and opened yet-to-be healed wounds from a nasty presidential election campaign. Some conservatives suggested the attack highlighted growing anti-white violence and was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement, although police said there was no indication of any connection.\n\nThe FBI does classify attacks based on disability as a hate crime. Federal numbers show 88 incidents related to attacks on disability in 2015.\n\nIn addition to underreporting, Levin said strong federal data of the race and ethnicity of assailants is incomplete because of the lack of consistent reporting.\n\nThe 2015 FBI data showed that of the 734 total reported offenses committed against whites \u2014 a single incident could have multiple offenses like assault or theft \u2014 46 percent of those were committed by blacks.\n\nIn contrast, of the 2,125 reported offenses committed against blacks, 58 percent of those who committed by whites.\n\nStill, despite the data, Levin said the Chicago beating is resonating because it was shown via social media and racial relations are tense following the November election. Live streams and 140 Twitter characters inflame the fires.\n\nLevin described the situation as \"a logjam of motivations\" for conflict, saying it's like nothing he's ever seen.\n\n\"We are seeing the coarseness that exists in society generally, those embers, have crossed the fire lines to all parts of the racial, ethnic and ideological spectrum,\" Levin said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Christina A.

And their parents, so often worried about providing the basics, can relax and participate in the revelry.\n\nWHY IT'S BETTER TO GIVE THAN RECEIVE\n\nWelcome to Christmas in the City, a family-led, 100-percent volunteer nonprofit that's been putting on a Christmas party like no other since 1989.\n\nMax Julien, a volunteer, grew up in Haiti, where Christmases were always sparse. \"I know what it's like to have nothing. I know what it's like to wake up on Christmas and think, 'What's Christmas? There's nothing in the house,'\" Julien told LifeZette.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the organization brings nearly 4,000 kids and their parents from all over the city to Boston City Hall, where an enormous celebration occurs. The families walk in on a red carpet to a banquet of food all for them. The children spend the afternoon at a winter wonderland carnival, with carousel rides, a petting zoo, face painting stations, and other activities.\n\nHOW OPEN-DOOR HOSPITALITY CHANGED ONE MOM\n\nHealth professionals also provide screenings, while dentists stand by to provide dental care. Children can also receive flu shots to inoculate them against the illnesses that often make the rounds at homeless shelters in winter.\n\nAnd hairdressers from across the city volunteer their time in the salon corner, giving haircuts all afternoon long.\n\nAs evening approaches, eyes grow wide after volunteers announce that Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus will be making a stop at the party, bringing a haul of toys. Each child receives a toy that he or she personally requested -- purchased and donated by a volunteer.\n\n\"I wish you could see these kids' faces when they open up a toy,\" Julien said. \"It's the best thing in the world.\"\n\n\"The kids really light up,\" said Christine Dixon, deputy director of Project Hope, which has a family shelter in Dorchester, Massachusetts. \"They have an amazing day with all kinds of activities, entertainment, and presents, which is a huge support to these moms. It's a tough time for the families that are here in the shelter. They've lost a lot.\"\n\nDixon said many of the families have only recently lost their homes and are struggling to get back on their feet and acclimate to their new environment. This party gives them hope.\n\nThe whole effort takes at least 3,000 volunteers -- almost as many volunteers as the number of people who attend. Julien has been with the nonprofit for three years, dedicating most of his free time in November and December to organizing gift lists and sign-ups to make the holiday special for children in need.\n\nAnd if the Christmas party isn't enough, the organization also sponsors programs for low-income kids who aren't homeless, but are still in dire financial need.\n\nThe Christmas in the City organization is proof that one family can make a significant difference in the community. The idea for the group began with one couple, Jake and Sparky Kennedy, who felt embarrassed by the number of gifts their young daughter received one Christmas in the late '80s. They decided to create a tradition of giving back instead.\n\nIn 1989, the Kennedys used their family business, Kennedy Brothers Physical Therapy, to create a list of coworkers, clients, and neighbors who were willing to volunteer time and gifts to homeless children. They sponsored the first Christmas in the City party, and 165 parents and children attended. The first party was simple by comparison -- just some decorations, a holiday meal, a personalized gift.\n\nBut as the years went on, the program expanded and an increasing number of volunteers allowed more children to attend and receive gifts.\n\nIt's the one day each year that the children and families say they're treated with dignity, Julien said.\n\nAnd for those who volunteer and participate, the party is a powerful reminder of the best humanity has to offer -- making a time of year that can be painful to so many full of laughter and joy instead.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 4.3708610534667995, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 642, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.7261639148900003, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.64797507788162, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/18/pentagon-recommended-against-manning-commutation-official-says.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1425, 1427, 1428, 1474, 1561, 1578, 1671, 1675, 2577, 2848, 3128, 3889]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 543, "scraper_regex": 601}}, "headline": "Pentagon recommended against Manning commutation, official says", "wordcount_as_scraped": 601, "date": "20170118170000", "story_content": "Outgoing Defense Secretary Ash Carter, as well as top U.S. Army leaders, recommended against President Obama commuting the bulk of Chelsea Manning's 35-year prison sentence for leaking classified documents, a senior defense official told Fox News.\n\nThe revelation comes as Obama has found himself on the defensive over the decision, with numerous security-minded lawmakers condemning the move and warning it sets a \"dangerous precedent.\" Obama is expected to defend the commutation at his final press conference in office Wednesday afternoon, amid speculation over whether more clemency decisions are coming.\n\nBut sources described to Fox News the vast extent of the potential damage done by Manning's document leak.\n\n\"Ambassadors were forced to resign, [CIA] station chiefs had to be recalled, secret diplomatic cables were revealed,\" said one official, recalling some of the fallout.\n\nFox News also has learned Manning leaked 700,000 documents, not the 250,000 cited by officials on Tuesday. Defense officials told Fox News that Manning's actions accelerated the Arab Spring and might even have contributed to the rise of ISIS.\n\nTwo intelligence sources also confirmed that after certain Afghanistan reports were released in 2010, the Taliban \"went on a killing spree,\" taking out everyone who seemed to fit the description of individuals working with the U.S.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf the report said \"someone with short dark\u00a0 hair was helping the U.S., the Taliban took out everyone with short dark hair. It was\u00a0indiscriminate,\"\u00a0one source said.\n\nBoth emphasized it's unclear whether U.S. intelligence assets were harmed \u00a0-- \u00a0but said there is no question people died after the leaks at the hands of the Taliban, and this made recruiting sources that much harder in the future.\n\nIn his pardon application, Manning's lawyer said otherwise: \"None of the disclosed documents caused any real damage to the United States. Instead, these documents simply embarrassed our country by revealing misconduct by the Department of Defense and unethical practices by the Department of State.\"\n\nManning was among 273 people granted clemency Tuesday by Obama.\n\nThe former Army intelligence analyst had asked Obama last November to commute her 35-year sentence for giving classified government and military documents to the WikiLeaks website. Manning, a transgender woman who was known as Bradley Manning at the time of her 2010 arrest, is more than six years into the sentence. After Obama's decision, she is to be released from prison in May.\u00a0\n\nRepublicans blasted the decision to commute Manning's sentence, with House Speaker Paul Ryan calling it \"outrageous\" and saying Obama had set a \"dangerous precedent\" that anyone guilty of compromising U.S. national security will no longer have to pay for their crimes.\u00a0\n\nManning originally was convicted in a mixed verdict. In 2013, an Army judge found him guilty of espionage but acquitted the analyst of aiding the enemy. Army prosecutors were unable to prove treason by linking Manning to support for Al Qaeda via the document leak to WikiLeaks.\u00a0\n\nOne name not on the list of pardons and commutations the White House announced Tuesday is U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. The former prisoner of war is accused of endangering comrades by walking off his post in Afghanistan, and has asked Obama for a pardon.\n\nA pardon would allow Bergdahl to avert a military trial scheduled for April. He faces charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The misbehavior charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.\n\nObama's spokesman declined to comment when asked Wednesday about Bergdahl.\n\n\"If we have news on this, then that's news that President Obama will make,\" Josh Earnest said.\n\nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson, Jennifer Griffin and Catherine Herridge and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.042016983032231, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 543, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.9666643320700001, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.7624309392265203, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/21/lis-wiehl-when-frozen-embroyos-sue-celebrity-sofia-vergara.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [161], "\u00a0": [2743, 3142]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 512, "scraper_regex": 579}}, "headline": "Lis Wiehl: When frozen embroyos sue a celebrity (Sofia Vergara)", "wordcount_as_scraped": 579, "date": "20161221220000", "story_content": "Sofia Vergara is being sued \u2014 by her frozen embryos!\n\nI'll explain.\n\nIn 2013 Vergara and her fianc\u00e9, Nicholas Loeb, underwent in-vitro fertilization and stored the frozen embryos in a California clinic. The couple entered into an agreement stating that they mutually agreed to bring the embryos to term, but there was no mention of what would happen if they broke up.\n\nSpending much of their time in Louisiana, they began interviewing potential surrogates and set up a trust fund for the unborn children. They even gave the embryos names: Emma and Isabella.\n\nAnd then, in 2014, the couple broke up. Their agreement, signed in California, didn't cover this eventuality. Loeb sued Vergara for custody of the embryos, but that case was dropped.\n\nNow, at the close of 2016, a case of first impression \u2014 a case that has never arisen before and requires an interpretation of the law \u2014 is being brought in Louisiana, where the law confers personhood on embryos, giving them the explicit right to sue and be sued. The law prohibits ownership or destruction of the embryos, and any disputes over them must be resolved in their \"best interests,\" which, it would seem to me, would always be to let them be implanted in a womb.\n\nThe embryos are represented by attorney Catherine Foster, the president of Sound Legal Group, a public interest group in Virginia that advocates for the right to life. (I tried to contact Vergara's attorney, but did not receive a reply.) Foster told me that Vergara and Loeb had spent much of their relationship in Louisiana, had planned for their life while in Louisiana and had broken up in Louisiana, so jurisdiction would hold up in the state.\n\nShe also said that this case is about the rights of the embryos, not the rights of Loeb and Vergara.\n\n\"There is no abortion implication here, no right to choose for a woman, because the embryos are not inside a woman,\" Foster said. \"So it is not about a woman's right to choose. It is about allowing the smallest and weakest amongst us having the chance to live.\"\n\nTo be born, the embryos would have to be implanted in a womb, and that would mean a woman would make the choice to carry them to term. Not allowing the embryos a chance to be born, Foster said, would take away their right, among other things, to inherit the trust that Loeb and Vergara set up for them.\n\nLawsuits over embryo custody, though rare, are not new. In 2012, a Pennsylvania appeals court awarded frozen embryos to a cancer survivor over the objection of her ex-boyfriend.\n\nThe Louisiana lawsuit gives Human Embryos 4B-A, also known as Emma and Isabella, the right to sue their biological mother to save their own potential lives.\n\nFor now,\u00a0as the legal battle moves along, the embryos remain frozen in a tank in California.\n\n\nLooking strictly at Louisiana law and the legal test of \"best interest if the embryo\" it's hard to imagine a court deciding for their destruction, assuming, that is, there is a woman to bring them to birth. Otherwise, the best interest of the embryos would take back seat to s surrogacy woman's right to choose. \u00a0\n\n\n\nLis Wiehl currently serves as a legal analyst for FOX News Channel (FNC).

Despite speculation -- fueled by WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange's own cryptic comments -- that he may have provided some of the emails that rocked the 2016 presidential election, Rich's father rejects such rumors.\n\n\"Anyone who knew Seth knew that wasn't the way he would have handled the problem,\" Rich's father, Joel Rich, told FoxNews.com in an exclusive interview, calling Assange's statements \"bizarre.\" \"He would not go outside the system.\"\n\nLike the Washington police, Rich believes his son was more likely killed in a robbery gone awry.\n\n\"The reason Seth was killed is probably because he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" said his father. \"There are all kinds of scenarios, but until something else is proven, these are just scenarios.\"\n\nRich was a cheerful, compassionate person, who wanted to make a positive impact, said his father.\n\n\"Seth above all wanted to make a difference in the world,\" Rich said of his son. \"At work, Seth was able to extend his desire to make everyone feel included to the basic right to vote in American elections.\"\n\nOne reason for the speculation that Rich may have leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks is that Assange offered a $20,000 reward leading to the arrest of the killers. That sum, added to Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman's $100,000 reward and the D.C. police's $25,000, tally more than any other reward offered in such a case in the nation's capital.\n\nDuring an Aug. 9 interview on Dutch television and in subsequent media interviews, Assange implied that Rich was killed because he was the WikiLeaks source of emails from top DNC officials showing they conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the party's presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz having to resign as DNC chairperson.\n\n\"We're interested in anything that might be a threat to alleged WikiLeaks sources, Assange later told Fox News Channel.\n\nOn the morning of his death, Rich had left his favorite watering hole, Lou's City Bar, about 1 a.m. to walk home, something that normally took 20 or 30 minutes. He tried twice to call his father, who had gone to sleep. He then called a fraternity brother and after that had two separate conversations with his girlfriend, Kelsey Mulka. Around 4:17 a.m., when Rich was about a block and a half from his home, his girlfriend heard other voices over the phone but was reassured by Rich that he was nearly home. Two minutes later, Rich was shot multiple times. Rich died at a nearby hospital.\n\nSecurity footage from a nearby market showed two men following Rich through a crosswalk by his home moments before he was shot, FoxNews.com has learned. The camera only captured the assailants' legs and Rich after he was shot and fell onto the street.\n\nPolice said Rich, who was shot twice in the back, was likely the victim of a robbery, though nothing of value, including his wallet, phone, keys, watch and gold necklace, were stolen.\n\n\"The Metropolitan Police Department is committed to bringing the person or persons responsible for Seth Rich's death to justice, D.C. police told FoxNews.com in a statement. \"As we mark the six-month anniversary of his death, we urge anyone with information to come forward and help bring his family the answers they deserve.\"\n\nRich would have had access to sensitive DNC information. His main duty at the DNC was to build an online system to get out the vote. The system, which combines government data, technologies and formats from all 50 states, allows anyone to check if they are registered to vote and, if not, where to register and how.\n\nHis talent was noticed. Four days before he was killed, Hillary Clinton's campaign had offered Rich a job, according to his father. His parents believe he would have accepted the position.\n\nOn August 3 of last year, Rich's parents went to D.C., where they attended a tribute to their son at Lou's City Bar.\n\n\"About 150 people came and the event went on for hours,\" his father said, noting many of his friends shared fond memories.\n\nMany of those same friends have done work in the community in his honor. On Jan. 3, just a day before what would have been his 28th birthday, Rich's friends volunteered at the D.C. Humane Society, a place Rich had served.\n\n\"This was rewarding and made my wife Mary and I feel good that Seth touched people who also want to make a difference.\"\n\nJoel Rich said his son was a people person, someone who went out of his way to welcome new people into his circle. He was a patriot, who often dressed in red, white and blue and slept with an American flag above his bed.\n\n\"What makes Seth stand out is wanting to help others and wanting to make a difference,\" his father said. \"As a parent, you always think your children are great, but after speaking to people who knew him who started calling the day after he was killed, we realized we didn't have to be as modest about what we said about him.\"\n\n\n\nMalia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

Gen. Stephen Townsend told reporters there are still an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 IS fighters defending Mosul. He applauded the efforts of Iraqi security forces, who began their offensive on Oct. 17 in what has been billed a decisive phase of the anti-IS fight.\n\n\"By our calculations, we think we have killed or badly wounded over 2,000,\" Townsend said at a joint news conference with U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter at Qayara air base.\n\nTownsend disputed any suggestion that the Islamic State has managed to fight the Iraqi government forces to standstill in Mosul.\n\nAfter citing the estimated 2,000 IS casualties, he added, \"I don't think that suggests anything about a stalemate. This is a major urban area. Any army on the planet, including the United States Army, would be challenged by this fight.\"\n\n\"The Iraqi army has come back from near-defeat two years ago, and now they are attacking this major city 400 kilometers (about 250 miles) from Baghdad,\" Townsend said. \"I don't think there is anything in there about a stalemate.\"\n\nTownsend said U.S. intelligence estimated before the Mosul campaign kicked off in October that IS had 3,500 to 6,000 fighters in the city. He said the current estimate is 3,000 to 5,000.\n\nUS officials have declined to say how many Iraqi government troops have been killed in the Mosul fight.\n\nCarter made an unannounced visit Sunday to the Qayara base, flying in from Baghdad after meeting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and sharing lunch with American troops. It was Carter's first visit to Qayara since it began operating as an Iraqi staging base in October.\n\nCarter toured the air base, greeting soldiers and offering holiday wishes. He assured them the Mosul campaign is on track.\n\n\"Everything is going according to the plan of a year ago,\" Carter said\n\nSunday's visit came as Iraqi security forces have been slowed in their nearly two-month-old offensive against IS, which has occupied Mosul for more than two years.\n\nIn Bahrain on Saturday, Carter announced he is sending another 200 troops to Syria to train and advise local fighters combatting IS. There are already 300 U.S. troops authorized for the Syria effort, and some 5,000 in Iraq.\n\nThe recapture of Mosul, the country's second largest city, is crucial to the Iraqis' hopes of restoring their sovereignty, although political stability will likely remain a challenge afterward.\n\nCarter told an international security conference in Bahrain that the battle for Mosul and for the Syrian city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremists' self-described caliphate, would be crucial for defeating the group, which has claimed attacks worldwide.\n\n\"The seizure of these two cities is necessary to ensure the destruction of ISIL's parent tumor in Iraq and Syria \u2014 the primary objective of our military campaign \u2014 and put ISIL on an irreversible path to a lasting defeat,\" he said, using another acronym for IS.\n\nHe did not predict how long it might take for Iraqi forces to prevail in Mosul, but he sounded a note of optimism.\n\n\"This is a complex mission that will take time to accomplish, but I am confident that ISIL's days in Mosul are numbered,\" he said in Bahrain.\n\nIraqi forces have only captured a handful of eastern Mosul neighborhoods since launching the offensive in mid-October. On Sunday they came under mortar fire as they worked to clear villages along the Tigris River to the south, part of operations to secure supply lines for a campaign that is likely to stretch into the coming year.\n\nCarter, whose tenure as defense secretary will end in January if his designated successor \u2014 retired Marine Gen. James Mattis \u2014 is confirmed by the Senate as expected, also made the case for keeping U.S. forces in Iraq even after the Islamic State group is dislodged from Mosul.\n\n\"Beyond security, there will still be towns to rebuild, services to re-establish, and communities to restore,\" he said in Bahrain. The extremists, he predicted, will attempt to survive by reinventing themselves \"in some other shape or form\" after they lose their grip on Iraq and Syria.\n\nIn Baghdad, six separate bombings targeting mostly streets and markets frequented by civilians killed 12 and wounded more than 30 people Sunday, according to Iraqi police and hospital officials. IS claimed responsibility for one of the attacks in southern Baghdad in a statement posted by the group's Amaq news agency. All Iraqi officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to brief the press.\n\nLeft unaddressed by Carter during his visit to Iraq was a possible change in course under President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office next month.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.54691076278687, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 782, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 21, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.06166657388, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161211180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.603580562659849, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/27/trump-refugee-clampdown-stops-iranian-path-through-austria.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [69]}}, "headline": "Trump's refugee clampdown stops Iranian path through Austria", "wordcount_as_scraped": 637, "date": "20170127190000", "story_content": "VIENNA \u2013 \u00a0Austria has shut its door to about 300 non-Muslim Iranians hoping to use the country as a way station before establishing new homes in the United States, The Associated Press has learned. The action is an early ripple effect of U.S. President Donald Trump's effort to clamp down on refugee admissions.\n\nUnder a 27-year-old program originally approved by Congress to help Jews in the former Soviet Union, Austria had been serving until recently as a conduit for Iranian Jews, Christians and Baha'i, who were at risk in their home country and eligible to resettle in the United States. Iran has banned the Baha'i religion, which was founded in 1844 by a Persian nobleman considered a prophet by followers.\n\nU.S. officials had been interviewing the candidates in Austria because they cannot do so in Iran. But the United States suspended the so-called \"Iranian Lautenberg Program\" in recent days, according to Austrian officials, who in turn stopped Iranians from reaching their territory. It's unclear when the program might restart.\n\nThe episode isn't directly linked to an executive order Trump is expected to sign, perhaps as soon as Friday, that would suspend the far broader U.S. refugee program for four months. But it reflects that knock-on effects already occurring from his tougher line on immigration and refugees. Similar to how tighter German migration rules had consequences across Europe, Trump's actions could lead other nations to take a harder look at people wishing to use their territories as transit points.\n\nThe net result could be even tougher conditions for people hoping to escape war and persecution for a better life abroad. There are more than 20 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations.\n\nAustrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnoell said the Alpine country acted after \"U.S. authorities told us that the onward trip for people to the U.S.A., who received visas from Austrian authorities as part of the program, would be put on hold for now.\"\n\nA State Department email sent Tuesday said the Austrian government had \"electronically canceled\" its visas for applicants who hadn't yet reached Austria. If they try to reach Austria anyway, they will be permanently blocked from Austria, according to the email, which was obtained by AP.\n\nSchnoell said the move affects about 300 Iranians with visas waiting to enter Austria. He said about 100 of them had been tracked down and informed that they can no longer do so. The search continues for the rest through airline ticket bookings and other means, Schnoell said.\n\nOther officials said a small number of Iranians with such short-term visas already were in Austria. It wasn't immediately clear what would happen with them.\n\nThe end of the program, named for former Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, could have broad implications for religious minorities in Iran.\n\nThe Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society says on its website that ending the U.S.-Austrian partnership \"puts people seeking religious freedom in danger and sends the wrong message about the pervasive violations of religious freedom in Iran.\"\n\nTrump is expected to pause the flow of all refugees to the U.S. and indefinitely bar those fleeing war-torn Syria. The president's upcoming order is also expected to suspend issuing visas for people from several predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 for at least 30 days, according to a draft executive order obtained by the AP.\n\nCancellation of the U.S. program could mean Iranians arriving in Austria with temporary visas would seek asylum in Austria. Immigration is a highly sensitive issue throughout Europe, which is struggling to deal with hundreds of thousands of people from Syria, North Africa and beyond.\n\nAustria, a nation of fewer than 9 million people, is already strained by efforts to accommodate and integrate more than 100,000 migrants who have flowed in since 2015.\n\n___\n\nCaldwell reported from Washington.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.2089986801147505, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 616, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.59688306492, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170127190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.08441558441558, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/09/program-seeks-to-use-seized-guns-for-good-in-el-salvador.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [84]}}, "headline": "Program seeks to use seized guns for good in El Salvador", "wordcount_as_scraped": 575, "date": "20161209190000", "story_content": "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador \u2013 \u00a0In one of the world's most deadly countries, a Swedish development organization is trying to turn a source of death into a resource that combats gun violence.\n\nThe Humanium Metal Initiative was launched in El Salvador in November. It aims to take guns off the streets and have the metal recycled and sold, with the revenue being funneled back into anti-violence programs, according to IM Swedish Development Partner, the group behind the initiative. \"Humanium\" is the name it gives to the metal produced from recycled guns.\n\nHans Blix, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a supporter of the gun initiative, said that when you see an ingot of the recycled gun metal you understand how it can be used for different purposes.\n\n\"You can make a pistol or a revolver of it and it's lethal,\" Blix said. But the same metal also \"can be used for very good purposes.\"\n\nIn 2015, gang violence pushed El Salvador's homicide rate to 103 killings for every 100,000 residents. In neighboring Honduras, it was 64 per 100,000 in 2015. A 2012 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found that 77 percent of the murders in Central America were committed with a firearm. Last year in El Salvador, 83 percent of the 6,071 murders were committed with a firearm, according to the government.\n\nThe weapons come from various sources. Some are legally registered then filter into the underworld. Others are leftover from the region's civil wars. And still others are smuggled from the United States.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, in 2015, 48 percent of the 4,068 seized weapons Salvadoran authorities sent it for traces were found to have originated in the U.S.\n\nIM Swedish Development Partner so far has several tons of the metal between existing stockpiles in El Salvador and Guatemala. The last weapon destruction in El Salvador destroyed 1,825 guns. The organization plans to scale up its work as demand grows for the metal.\n\nThe Swedish group doesn't collect the guns itself or melt them down. The guns are either seized or collected from gun holders by local authorities, who then melt them down into ingots, wire or pellets, depending on what the buyer needs, according to the organization.\n\nWhat it does do is certify that the metal comes from recycled guns, sells the ingots to socially conscious companies then uses the revenue to fund violence prevention programs and help victims of gun violence in the country where the metal originated. It is basically trying to create a market for the gun metal.\n\n\"We hope that the Humanium Metal Initiative will also be an incentive for world leaders to promote weapons destructions program, as part of the commitments made under the Sustainable Development Goals/agenda 2030,\" IM senior adviser Peter Brune said in an email.\n\nThe organization says it is currently negotiating with several global brands. The metal could be used for items ranging from jewelry to smartphone cases. The metal will not initially be available on the open market, but rather to specific commercial partners.\n\n\"These are the weapons from which people get killed every day,\" Blix said. \"\"In the Bible, they say you can make swords into ploughshares. So it's a famous, old, thousands-of-years wisdom, and that is what we should do.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Christopher Sherman in Mexico and David Keyton in Stockholm contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.7552673816680895, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 558, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.2672661660599998, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.2258064516129, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2017/01/30/as-trump-doubles-down-in-immigration-policy-sanctuary-restaurant-movement-grows-nationwide.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [3978, 4550], "\u00a0": [2076, 2116, 2130, 2250, 2794, 2834, 2917, 3144, 3948, 5201, 5254, 5257]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 737, "scraper_regex": 812}}, "headline": "As Trump doubles down in immigration policy, 'Sanctuary Restaurant' movement grows nationwide", "wordcount_as_scraped": 812, "date": "20170130200000", "story_content": "As President Donald Trump works to limit immigration and build a Mexican border wall to keep foreigners from entering the U.S. illegally, more than 150 restaurants in America are taking a stand.\n\nIn cities throughout the country, including New York, Minneapolis, Detroit, Boston, Oakland, Chicago and Ann Arbor, Mich., restaurants are declaring themselves to be part of a grassroots \"Sanctuary Restaurants Movement.\"\n\nSanctuary restaurants agree to anti-discrimination policies, put up signs on windows that pronounce their sanctuary status and receive know-your-rights training, such as webinars on how to ask federal immigration agents for proper paperwork if there's an attempted raid.

Organizers of the movement say the restaurant industry, given its heavy reliance on immigrant labor, is more vulnerable than others.\n\n\"Every day more restaurants and diners are signing up with a clear commitment to be together and stand up to the policies we're now seeing coming from the administration,\u00a0said Matt Nelson, executive director of\u00a0Presente.org,\u00a0a partner with the Sanctuary Restaurant Movement.\n\nDespite growing support, not everyone is on board with the movement.\u00a0\n\nThe National Restaurant Association, which represents roughly 500,000 businesses, is pushing for a complete immigration overhaul, including an updated verification system that confirms employees' eligibility to work in the country legally. Association Senior Vice President Steve Danon told the Associated Press that the organization \"is looking forward to working with the Trump administration\" on ways to make verification \"easier and more cost-efficient.\n\nApproximately 12 million people work in the U.S. restaurant industry, according to\u00a0Restaurant Opportunities Centers United\u00a0(ROC), a partner organization that helped found the Sanctuary Restaurant Movement.\u00a0Immigrants comprise up to 70 percent of the restaurant workers in big cities like New York and Chicago, and an estimated 1.3 million restaurant workers in the country are here illegally.\n\nAmid numerous reports of restaurateurs\u00a0routinely underpaying undocumented workers, some question if owners or employers who join the Sanctuary Restaurants Movement are adhering to fair payment practices, and agree to pay undocumented workers the same as legal workers.\n\n\"First off, all owners are asked to become part of Restaurants Advancing Industry Standards in Employment (RAISE),\" Nelson says.\n\nRAISE is an advocacy organization committed to improving wages and labor practices in the industry, and one of the first partners of the movement.\n\n\"I can't speak for all employers, but employers [in the SRM] would pay by position and by experience.

Many souvenirs \u2014 including the West Bank town's trademark rosemary beads \u2014 are imported from abroad, mainly China.\n\nA small number of souvenir shops are now trying to fight the trend, stocking their shelves almost exclusively with locally made products. Shopkeepers say that while their wares may be more expensive, the quality is much better and they give an important boost to the struggling economy.\n\n\"I've got nothing that is made overseas except for one thing, that's the magnets. It's something that sells for cheap and people want them,\" said Bassem Giacaman, owner of the Blessings Gift Shop and The Olive Wood Factory. \"Everything else is made locally so I can keep the local economy working.\"\n\nSome 120,000 people are expected to visit the Holy Land this holiday season, half of them Christian, according to Israel's Tourism Ministry.\n\nMany will visit Bethlehem, where globalization has left its imprint like everywhere else. Foreign-made crafts, especially Chinese ones, have come to represent a big part of the market here, including Christmas souvenirs. While there are no official statistics, local officials and businessmen estimate that nearly half of the products, perhaps more, are imported.\n\nGiacaman keeps just a few imported products in his store, most of them hidden in a small box beneath a counter. He takes them out to show customers and compare them to Palestinian-made ones.\n\n\"This is a plastic Jesus baby made in China and this is a ceramic one made in Bethlehem, and these are the olive wood rosaries that I make and the Chinese ones,\" he said, proudly showing what he said was the superior craftsmanship of the locally made goods.\n\nBethlehem is in the West Bank, occupied territory the Palestinians hope will be part of their future state.

The center targets independent travelers and takes a fair trade approach to its business.\n\nTrying to sell only Palestinian-made products comes with challenges.\n\n\"Maintaining consistency and quality, the right lead time, figuring how much production capacity the producers can give,\" are some of them, explained Khoury.\n\nThen there's the issue of price.\n\nMaher Canawati, owner of the Three Arches souvenir shop, sells locally made gifts and even has a wood workshop in the back. But he keeps room for imports as well.\n\n\"We have to carry all kinds of merchandise in our shop because we have different markets and different pilgrims with different budgets,\" said Canawati, whose family has provided services to pilgrims since the 16th century.\n\nCanawati said he wants to give his customers options, and he is clear about the differences.\n\n\"A dozen of made-in-China rosaries sell for $4 while a dozen of locally made sell for $25,\" he said. \"The made-in-China Jesus babies sell for $20 and the Bethlehem ones sell for $64.\"\n\nWhile craft workshop owners grumble about foreign imports, not everyone believes the imports have seriously threatened local merchants and artisans.\n\n\"It's a business,\" said Samir Hazboun, Chairman of the Bethlehem Chamber of Commerce. \"I'm not aware of anyone running out of business because of the imports.\"\n\nAli Abu Srour, director general of the Palestinian Tourism Ministry, said the government is trying to update its tourism laws to protect local producers and merchants.\n\nUnder the proposed regulations, shopkeepers would be required to carry 70 percent locally made products, with clear labels that distinguish between imports and \"Made in Palestine\" ones.\n\nMuhammad Yusuf, a wood craftsman with The Olive Wood Factory, scoffs at the imports.\n\n\"It's not good, this is better,\" he said with a smile as he worked on a figure of the Virgin Mary.\n\nBack at the Blessings Gift Shop, Julie Deler, 24, a tourist from Germany, bought a small olive wood camel made by a Palestinian craftsman.\n\n\"I prefer locally made because I want to support the locals,\" she said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.8064516186714169, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 797, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.3545149478, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 4, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.75658720200753, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/27/time-death-check-bodys-necrobiome.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [751, 3440]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 589, "scraper_regex": 620}}, "headline": " Time of death?

The necrobiome, or the community of bacteria found on a dead body, changes considerably as time passes after death and the body decomposes, according to the study.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, medical examiners estimate the time of death by physically inspecting the body for signs of early-phase decomposition and, in later stages of decomposition, by looking at the insects present on the body , the researchers wrote. But \"these techniques are notoriously unreliable,\" thanks to factors such as temperature, weather conditions and geographic location, the researchers wrote.\n\nBut \"by knowing which microbes take over a dead body and how long it takes, forensic scientists might be able to use [the necrobiome] to determine time of death or other aspects of a crime scene,\" Robert DeSalle, curator of molecular systematics at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, said in a statement. DeSalle was not involved in the study.\n\nIn the study, the researchers took samples of bacteria from the ear and nasal canals of the cadavers, which were at the Anthropological Research Facility at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The cadavers were placed outdoors, in a temperate, deciduous forest, and were left to decompose naturally over the course of several weeks.\n\nThe researchers sequenced the DNA of the bacteria, and used their findings to construct a model that could predict a body's time of death to up to 55 \"accumulated degree-days,\" which is equal to about two summer days.\n\nAccumulated degree-days are a way to measure the passage of time and temperature simultaneously, said senior study author Nathan Lents, a professor of microbiology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at The City University of New York.\n\nBecause human decomposition is strictly dependent on both time and temperature, scientists cannot consider the passage of time alone, Lents told Live Science. \"When it comes to rates of decay, one day in summer time is like two weeks in winter time,\" he said.\n\nThe bacterial communities found on a dead body change over time, Lents said.\n\n\"Think about a decomposing vertebrate as an ecosystem\" teeming with various life-forms, Lents said. \"The ecosystem is very dynamic because the environment of the decomposing host is in a state of wild changes.\"\n\nFor example, cycles of high and low oxygen levels play a role in which bacteria are present, as oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide builds up in the body. But the body's tissues eventually rupture, and oxygen flows back in, changing the environment again. There are also cycles of high and low nutrient richness, Lents said; nutrient levels may be low until a tissue ruptures and nutrients spill out.\n\nUltimately, \"the environment is a feeding frenzy for alternating groups of organisms, setting up a succession of bacteria that proliferate when their time comes,\" Lents said.\u00a0\n\nBut researchers still have a great deal to learn about this ecosystem, Lents added.\n\nThe new study is \"a very promising proof of concept,\" Lents said in a statement. Still, the method could be improved by adding more data, from a larger study at multiple locations, and involving bacteria from additional parts of the body, they wrote in the study.\n\nOriginally published on Live Science .\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.24074077606201, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 589, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.23315090602, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 6, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.01867572156197, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.545454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/30/trump-faces-new-federal-lawsuits-over-immigration-executive-order.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [325, 457, 731, 1441, 1806, 1895, 2333, 2692, 2896, 3178, 5277]}}, "headline": "Trump faces new federal lawsuits over immigration executive order", "wordcount_as_scraped": 906, "date": "20170130220000", "story_content": "The Trump administration is facing a fresh wave of federal lawsuits in the wake of its controversial executive order on immigration \u2013 with challenges emerging so far from civil rights groups, Muslims barred from entering the U.S., and a state attorney general.\u00a0\n\nWashington Attorney General Bob Ferguson on Monday afternoon became the first state official to sue the president over the issue.\u00a0\n\n\"We are a country based on the rule of law,\" Ferguson, a Democrat, said at a news conference in Seattle. \"In a courtroom, it is not the loudest voice that prevails. It's the Constitution.\"\n\nThe lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order blocking Trump's executive order.\u00a0\n\nFerguson was among 16 state attorneys general who released a statement Sunday calling the president's immigration order \"un-American and unlawful.\"\n\nHis lawsuit, along with several others, signal a protracted legal fight ahead over Friday's executive order, by far the most controversial measure President Trump has signed since taking office. As the White House voices confidence the measure will be upheld, critics are citing anti-discrimination laws and the Constitution in challenging the order.\n\nThe order signed Friday specifically suspends the refugee program for 120 days and suspends entry to the U.S. for travelers from seven terror hotspots (which also are Muslim-majority countries) for 90 days.\u00a0\n\nThe rocky rollout of Trump's order sparked confusion and chaos at the nation's airports as customs agents struggled over how to interpret it. It also triggered protests coast to coast.\n\nSince Friday, four federal judges have ordered various holds relating to travelers affected over the weekend. But judges have not yet ruled on the broader aspects of the order.\u00a0\n\nTrump and his team have adamantly defended the plan as critical for national security.\u00a0\n\n\"The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror,\" Trump said. \"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama pushed back Monday on any comparison between their immigration policies as well as the \"notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\" \u00a0\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer shrugged off legal challenges and told reporters Monday he feels \"pretty confident that if there's any problems we'll prevail.\"\n\nHe added, \"This is a national security issue.\"\n\nBut Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, argued that the Trump administration has violated the law.\u00a0\n\n\"It's the law vs. Donald Trump,\" Awad said.\n\nCAIR filed a lawsuit Monday in Virginia on behalf of 20 Muslims that claims Trump's executive order violates due process and equal protection under the law.\u00a0\n\nBut challenging the policy might be easier said than done.\n\nFederal law gives Trump sweeping authority over immigration. He is legally allowed, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, to suspend entry for people or classes of people he believes would be harmful to the nation.\u00a0\n\nA 1965 update to the law says people should not be subjected to preferential treatment or discrimination based on their \"race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.\"\n\nThe White House argues that the executive order is not a Muslim ban and that it prohibits all people from specific countries that have an established terrorist network.\n\nHowever, in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday, Trump indicated he would give preferential treatment to persecuted Christians from Syria and stated that Muslims were given priority under the previous administration.\n\n\"If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible,\" Trump said. He added, \"And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\"\n\nThe United States admitted 38,901 Muslim refugees in 2016 \u2013 nearly the same number of Christians, 37,521, were also admitted, according to a report by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\n\nThe CBN interview coupled with an admission from Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani on Fox News that Trump contacted him and others about how to legally craft a ban could be used as ammunition by immigration and civil liberty activists to prove the administration's intent.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which has raised at least $24 million since Saturday morning and added 150,000 new members, also filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of two Iraqis who were temporarily detained at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on Saturday. The men were on their way to the U.S. on immigrant visas.\n\nOne of them, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, worked as an electrical engineer and contractor for the U.S. government from 2003-2010. He also worked as an interpreter during the invasion of Iraq. Brandon Friedman, who commanded the platoon during the invasion, tweeted Sunday that Darweesh \"spent years keeping U.S. soldiers alive in combat in Iraq.\"\n\nThe second man detained, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife and 7-year-old son who are legal permanent residents in Houston.\n\n\"President\u00a0Trump's war on equality is already taking a terrible human toll,\" Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, said in a written statement. \"This ban cannot be allowed to continue.\"\n\nRuthann Robson, professor of law at City University of New York School of Law, told The Washington Post that Trump's order could be thrown out for violating the equal protection clause of the Constitution.

Dougherty County Coroner Michael Fowler said a fourth person died in his county Sunday, without elaborating.\n\nMany families in the area had\u00a0\"no homes, no food, no warmth, no hope,\"\u00a0County\u00a0Commission Chairman Chris Cohilas said during a news conference Monday, apparently choking back tears. Pleading for aid, he said,\u00a0\"we've exhausted everything we have.\"\n\nAt least 15 people were killed in south Georgia alone, including seven from an apparent winter twister that tore through a trailer park before dawn Sunday. Officials reported four deaths Saturday in Mississippi as the storm system ramped up. In addition, a tree knocked over by strong winds split a home in half, killing one person in\u00a0Columbia County, Fla., emergency officials said.\n\nIn southwest Georgia, Bridget Simmons along with her parents, her daughter and her grandson were in their brick home in the city of Albany when the sky got dark Sunday afternoon and the wind began to howl.\n\n\"I was in the den and I heard that loud roar and I grabbed the baby and I said, `Let's go guys. This is it.' We laid down and that was it.\" The wind was so loud, she added, \"you could hear it beating back and forth.\"\n\nMinutes later, their home was largely unscathed, save for a carport that collapsed atop two cars. But trees were down all around, police sirens wailed and authorities would add four more deaths for an overall count of at least 19.\n\nThe National Weather Service said a survey team concluded Monday that a tornado left a path of destruction a half-mile wide in parts of Albany. The agency said it was an EF-2 tornado or stronger, meaning it packed winds of at least 111 to 135 mph.\n\nSome 60 miles away from Simmons' home, Coroner Tim Purvis in south Georgia's Cook County confirmed seven people died at the mobile home park in the rural community of Adel, where about half of the 40 homes were leveled. Debris lay about not far from mobile homes largely untouched but emptied of survivors and cordoned off by police.\n\nElsewhere, shredded siding from mobile homes, a house stripped of exterior walls but left standing, even a piano blown outdoors, all bore evidence of the power of the powerful storms system that tore across the Deep South.\n\nThe 15 killed in south Georgia included two deaths each in the counties of Berrien and Brooks.\n\nIn South Carolina, the National Weather Service has confirmed that two tornadoes struck over the weekend, injuring one woman who was trapped in a mobile home that was damaged near Blackville. The weather service says a tornado touched down about 3:45 p.m. Saturday in Barnwell County and moved into Bamberg County. The other occurred in Orangeburg County a few minutes later.\n\nWeather experts say tornadoes can hit any time of year in the South -- including in the dead of winter. Even north Florida was under the weekend weather threat.\n\nWhile the central U.S. has a fairly defined tornado season -- the spring -- the risk of tornadoes \"never really goes to zero\" for most of the year in the Southeast, explained Patrick Marsh of the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.\n\nHe said 39 possible tornadoes were reported across the Southeast from early Saturday into Sunday evening -- none immediately confirmed. Of that, 30 were reported in Georgia, four in Mississippi, and one each in Louisiana and South Carolina.\n\nJanuary tornado outbreaks are rare but not unprecedented, particularly in the South. Data from the Storm Prediction Center shows that, over the past decade, the nation has seen an average of 38 tornadoes in January, ranging from a high of 84 in 2008 to just four in 2014.\n\nNineteen-year-old Jenny Bullard said she and her parents, Jeff and Carla, are glad to have escaped without major injury after an apparent tornado battered their home in Cook County. They are a farming family dating back generations, living not far from where the mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nThe middle section of their brick house was blown off the slab, leaving nothing but the kitchen island standing. On one side, the parents' bedroom remained intact. Jenny's bedroom on the other side was smashed in -- and a piano was blown out of the house.\n\nShe recalled awaking to the sound of hail before dawn.\n\n\"The hall wall came in on me and I fell down. And our backdoor came through and fell in on me. And I heard my dad calling my name ...There was a bunch of stuff on top of him and I just started throwing everything I could until I got to him,\" she said.\n\nTogether, she and her father met up with their mother and got free.\n\nThe young woman wore a sling on one arm hours afterward Sunday as she went back through the debris for belongings. Bricks lay scattered about, alongside their possessions and furniture.\n\n\"The first thing I wanted to do was get all the pictures,\" she said. Across the street, where the Bullards kept farm equipment in sheds, one shed was blown in amid twisted metal. Two grain silos were blown over.\n\n\"It's a horrible tragedy. But all this stuff can be replaced,\" she said. \"We can't replace each other. We're extremely lucky.

Jim Risch, R-Idaho, described it last week, the pace has been \"dizzying.\"\u00a0\n\nTRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ACTIONS\n\nThe president's order Friday suspending the U.S. refugee program and taking other sweeping immigration measures has been the most controversial by far. But the actions nevertheless show Trump doing what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail -- and quickly. \u00a0\n\n\"It's classic President Donald Trump style,\" White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News'\u00a0\"Justice with Judge Jeanine\"\u00a0on Saturday. \"It's exactly who he's been in business, as a candidate, as president-elect and now president. He's all about action and impact.\"\n\nFor good measure, Trump also met with British Prime Minister Theresa May, called several world leaders, openly feuded with media organizations and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, and sent out 69 tweets (not counting retweets) \u2013 49 from his personal account and 20 from Trump's newly acquired @POTUS.\n\nTrump's early pace of executive actions is similar to that of President Obama, who signed five executive orders and, according to one tally, nine memoranda in his first week.\u00a0\n\nTrump's actions, however, were more sweeping than Obama's.\u00a0\n\nAnd a review shows that Presidents George W. Bush and Clinton worked at a slower pace than either Obama or Trump in their opening days.\u00a0\n\nBush's only \"action\" was a restoration of the Mexico City Policy, which stops U.S. money from funding international groups that promote or perform abortions (which Trump also restored last week after it was revived under Obama). Otherwise, Bush's efforts mostly were focused on stopping Clinton's final deeds. He ordered a halt to the publication of new regulations and also issued instructions to slow the implementation of Clinton's final executive orders.\n\nClinton's early acts were focused on social policy, particularly abortion. He took steps to make RU-486 \u2013 an abortion drug \u2013 accessible, reversed a Department of Defense ban on abortion, issued an executive order to overturn a \"gag rule\" on doctors informing patients about abortion options and lifted a moratorium on federal funding of fetal tissue transplantation research.\n\nClinton also moved to proclaim a \"National Day of Fellowship and Hope\" and issued two executive orders: one making sure that senior employees signed ethics pledges and another establishing a National Economic Council.\n\nObama, after a successful campaign built on the concept of \"change,\" tried to swiftly turn concept into reality.\n\nObama issued executive orders from the start suspending all ongoing proceedings at Guantanamo Bay and requiring the Army Field Manual be used as a guide to terror interrogations. The order banned torture, after Obama during the campaign was highly critical of the practice of \"waterboarding.\"\n\nObama also enacted a pay freeze for senior White House staff who made more than $100,000, suspended pending federal regulations proposed by the Bush administration and made senior staff sign ethics rules regarding lobbying. On the environmental front, he ordered higher fuel efficiency standards and allowed states to raise emissions standards.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.12925171852112, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 600, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.8160167021499998, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170130180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.16666666666667, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/04/rep-mark-walker-can-still-save-what-has-been-broken-by-big-government-here-s-how.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [122, 532, 545, 1147, 2008, 3064, 3957, 4603, 4662]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 693, "scraper_regex": 746}}, "headline": "Rep.

Here's how", "wordcount_as_scraped": 746, "date": "20170104160000", "story_content": "\"Hear us again for the first time!\" \u00a0Effective Conservatism and the Republican Study Committee.\n\nThe Republican Study Committee (RSC) has been the foundation of conservative policy in Congress for more than four decades. The RSC's dedication to enacting conservative principles in policy should be unwavering and I am honored to follow strong leaders including Vice President-elect Mike Pence, Dr. Tom Price and other previous chairmen.\n\nThere is\u00a0overwhelming\u00a0evidence to support a hopeful and optimistic outlook for the 115th Congress. \n\nThrough a rare opportunity enabled by unified government we can pursue impactful and effective conservative policy. Congress will repeal ObamaCare, deliver on authentic tax reform, secure our borders, and protect religious liberty. Moreover, conservatives will hold the line against proposals that expand government, limit individual freedom and threaten our national security. The stakes are high and the decisions we make, the policy we create, and the votes we take should lead to better law that positively impacts all\u00a0communities.\n\nYet, we must also ask the question -- is knowing the right policy alone enough? I believe the day has arrived when preaching to the choir is no longer adequate -- that's the easy road. The worn-out language and rhetoric may be attractive language to our base, but the oft-repeated talking points of individual liberty and personal prosperity falls short in reaching many of our communities. We can do better.\n\nFor too long some conservatives have stubbornly refused to modify the approach and voice in promoting and advocating a conservative message and agenda. We have invested poorly in community relationships with a blind eye to the suffering thinking that a better program or a pandering policy would be the solution, even as we know that no government program, however well intentioned, can provide for the authentic needs of our neighbors.\u00a0\n\nI am growing more convinced that policy alone is insufficient without the right approach and the right voice. The American people are demanding \"effective conservatism\" and I am certain that all three \u2013 the right policy, the right approach, and the right voice can be accomplished.\n\n\"Hear us again for the first time!\" Conservatives need to reintroduce our voice, vision, policies, rationale, and principles to all people and communities. Doing this does not require the Republican Party to be a Big Tent party with a purpose only to include more ideas that trample the principles and standards that conservatives adhere to, but this mission is about having an opportunity to better explain why we believe in the things we believe. Through the power of persuasion and winning the debate, conservatives will put points on the board that result in clear wins for the American People.\n\nAs RSC chairman, my hope is to lay out clear and measurable objectives with contemporary messaging that communicates our principles of opportunity, liberty, and security.\u00a0I don't assume that we're the first to share such a vision but the American People have afforded us this momentum and we must act with urgency \u2013 not out of political gain or posturing but rather out of the belief that good policy with the right approach can change America for the better.\n\nWhy is the RSC the key to Effective Conservatism? The RSC consists of conservative members in the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives represents the People, and accountability of Representatives to the American People must be strictly enforced by voters, or the will of the people will be ignored. \n\nI believe members of the RSC were elected to represent conservatism. Together, conservatives can make a difference and change the misguided policies and laws that have broken the family, stifled entrepreneurship, and veered away from the Constitution. Liberty. Opportunity. Security.\u00a0\n\nI understand there are huge challenges ahead. Some would question whether it is even possible to be conservative and effective in Congress. But I have confidence and faith in the Republican Study Committee and the men and women who make up the largest caucus in all of Congress. \n\nWe will work to rediscover the path to Effective Conservatism and the vision of our Founding Fathers. We will listen to the American People and implement their ideas into our solutions.\n\nIt is not too late to save what has been broken by big government. \n\nIt is not too late to reestablish a constitutionally limited government that is efficient and productive. \u00a0\n\nIt is not too late to be heard again for the first time.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRep, Mark Walker is the Chairman of the Republican Study Committee for the 115th Congress.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.9557945132255551, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 693, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.08100420768, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170104160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8860028860028897, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/12/04/tech-q-are-facebook-quizzes-safe.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4161, 4423]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 662, "scraper_regex": 747}}, "headline": "Tech Q&A: Are Facebook quizzes safe?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 747, "date": "20161204130000", "story_content": "Read this before you take another Facebook quiz\n\nQ: Is it safe to take quizzes on Facebook?

It also prohibits activity aimed at \"overthrowing the socialist system,\" a reference to challenges to the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power.\n\nChinese leaders promote internet use for business and education but try to block access to material deemed subversive or obscene. The country has the biggest population of Internet users at 710 million, according to government data.\n\nThe latest measure approved by the National People's Congress requires companies to enforce censorship and aid in investigations and imposes standards for security technology.

But the timeline and which plan will emerge remains unclear. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nPrice on Wednesday also faced questions from committee Democrats about his investments in health care companies.\n\nThey said Price's investments raise potential conflicts of interest and have called for a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into possible insider trading. And they want to delay his nomination until such an investigation would be completed.\n\nLast week, Price signed a government ethics agreement pledging to sell his stocks, but that hasn't stopped the questions.\n\nThe latest controversy involves Price's purchase last year of stocks in Zimmer Biomet, a major medical device manufacturer. The acquisitions, in part through a broker, came around the same time that Price introduced legislation to suspend Medicare rules seen as problematic for such companies.\n\n\"Everything we have done has been above board, transparent and legal,\" Price said Wednesday. He also denied that he bought stock on a \"tip\" from New York GOP Rep. Chris Collins, who has boasted about making \"millions\" on his deal. \u00a0\n\nOn ObamaCare, Trump told The Washington Post over the weekend that he's close to having a plan that will provide insurance for everybody and lower some costs. That surprised many on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are still looking for a path.\n\nKentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul is among them and last week outlined his plan to Fox News that included more low-cost plans, health saving accounts and tax credits to help customers save money.\n\nThe hearing Wednesday is known as a \"courtesy\" hearing because some federal health policy issues are under the committee's purview. However, Price will also go before the Senate Finance Committee, which will vote on whether to send his nomination to a full floor vote.\n\nPrice is largely a known quantity on Capitol Hill. To get the secretary post, he would need 51 final votes, with Republicans having 52 senators and Democrats having 48.\n\nTrump's bottom line on health care remains a mystery for Democrats and Republicans.\n\nHe campaigned on repealing ObamaCare but has also talked about providing insurance for everyone and taking on the drug companies.\n\n\"Nobody is going to be dying on the streets with a President Trump,\" Trump said Wednesday on \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nHe offered no new details but said his plan would \"probably\" turn Medicaid over to the states in the form of block grants to cover low income people.\n\nPrice, 62, represents Atlanta's northern suburbs and chairs the House Budget Committee. A budget hawk and a social conservative, he drafted his own plan to replace Obamacare, which outside analysis said would save taxpayers money but covered fewer people.\n\nTrump transition team spokesman Phillip Blando said recently that the Zimmer Biomet purchase was directed by Price's stockbroker as part of ongoing management of the congressman's investments.\n\nThe spokesman also said Price had no advance knowledge and had not directed the broker to consider the company. Government records show that Price was notified about the purchase more than a week after he offered the legislation. His spokesman said Price had been working on the bill for months.\n\nGeorgia GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson, a member of the Senate health committee, said Wednesday: \"Tom was unaware of the purchase. People have taken to unrelated facts. In fact nothing about this could be more unrelated.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.3745318353176121, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 743, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.42575710257, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.28802153432032, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/04/turkey-identifies-nightclub-attack-gunman-5-isis-suspects-detained.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [326]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 720, "scraper_regex": 566}}, "headline": "Turkey identifies nightclub attack gunman; 5 ISIS suspects detained", "wordcount_as_scraped": 566, "date": "20170104120000", "story_content": "Turkey on Wednesday said it had identified the gunman who slaughtered 39 people in an Istanbul nightclub -- but the country's foreign minister wouldn't name the killer, who continued to elude the nation's dragnet.\n\nVIDEO: MORE ARRESTS MADE IN HUNT FOR SHOOTER\u00a0\n\nTurkish media has twice published incorrect names or pictures of a possible suspect in the days since the early Sunday attack at Reina, which could be contributing to the government's cautious approach this time.\n\n\"The identity of the person who carried out the attack on the Reina nightclub has been established,\" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told state-run news agency Anadolu in a live televised interview.\n\nSELFIE VIDEO PURPORTEDLY SHOWS ALLEGED ISTANBUL NIGHTCLUB GUNMAN\n\nTurkish police, meanwhile, detained at least five suspected ISIS militants believed to be linked to the attack during an operation in the Aegean port city of Izmir, Anadolu reported.\n\nISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, which also wounded nearly 70 people.

Police were stopping cars and Istanbul's ubiquitous yellow taxis, with passengers and drivers holding up their identifications while officers inspected inside the vehicles. Istanbul has been on high alert since the attack, with the gunman still at large. The killer had used a taxi to get to and from the nightclub on the morning of the attack.\n\nThe private Dogan news agency said that Wednesday's police operation targeted three families who had arrived in Izmir about 20 days ago from Konya \u2014 a city in central Turkey where the gunman is thought to have been based before carrying out the nightclub attack. It said 27 people, including women and children, were taken into custody.\n\nAt least 14 people were previously detained in connection with the attack, including two foreigners stopped Tuesday at the international terminal of Istanbul's Ataturk Airport after police checked their cellphones and luggage, according to Anadolu.\n\nTurkish media reports claimed Tuesday that the gunman's wife was in custody and had told police she didn't know her husband was linked to ISIS. An eerie selfie video emerged of the alleged gunman on Tuesday, showing him silently touring Istanbul's most famous square. The camera never leaves the man's unsmiling face as he walked through Taksim Square during the 44-second clip that was broadcast on state-run Anadolu television and other Turkish media.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.37772083282471, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 720, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 14, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.238742991590001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 8, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.30555555555556, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/16/former-defense-secretary-melvin-laird-dead-at-94.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [67]}}, "headline": "Former defense secretary Melvin Laird dead at 94", "wordcount_as_scraped": 908, "date": "20161116230000", "story_content": "MARSHFIELD, Wis. \u2013 \u00a0Melvin Laird, a former Wisconsin congressman and U.S. defense secretary during years when President Nixon struggled to find a way to withdraw troops from an unpopular war in Vietnam, died on Wednesday, his family said. He was 94.\n\nHis grandson, Raymond Dennis Large III, said that Laird died in Florida.\n\nLaird, who helped engineer the withdrawal of troops from a war that divided the country and killed some 58,000 U.S. troops, left a legacy that included a telephone call that eventually played a role in one of the biggest political stories of the century \u2014 the Watergate scandal that drove Nixon from office.\n\nLaird was Nixon's counselor on domestic affairs in October 1973 when Nixon had to replace Vice President Spiro Agnew, who had resigned in scandal. Laird called his good friend, Michigan Rep. Gerald Ford, to ask if he would be interested in replacing Agnew.\n\n\"Frankly, the question came like a bolt out of the blue,\" Ford said in 1997, recalling his conversation with the \"can-do conservative\" from Wisconsin.\n\nFord accepted. About a year later, Nixon resigned because of Watergate and Ford became president. Ford pardoned Nixon, and two years later, Ford lost the presidential election to Jimmy Carter.\n\n\"I thought Ford was the right person to bring the country together after the Watergate fiasco,\" Laird once said, taking credit with Bryce Harlow for persuading Nixon to pick Ford.\n\nFord once praised Laird as a patriot before a partisan.\n\nLaird, the son of a Presbyterian minister, was 30 when he was elected to the U.S. House in 1952. He represented Wisconsin's 7th District \u2014 mostly dairy-farming or lumber-producing counties in central Wisconsin \u2014 for nine terms, and was credited with helping spearhead the vast expansion of medical research and health facilities in the U.S.\n\nNixon appointed Laird as the nation's 10th defense secretary in 1969 and the first to come from Congress. The Vietnam War raged, with no end in sight for the 550,000 troops stationed in the Southeast Asian country as America lost its resolve for the fighting.\n\nLaird coined the term \"Vietnamization\" to describe Nixon's policy of assigning an ever-increasing combat role to South Vietnamese troops, allowing the pullout of U.S. forces.\n\nWhen Laird stepped down as defense secretary in January 1973, there were about 69,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam.\n\n\"As a consequence of the success of the military aspects of Vietnamization, the South Vietnamese people today, in my view, are fully capable of providing for their own in-country security against the North Vietnamese,\" he said at the time.\n\nHowever, Saigon fell under communist control in 1975. But the problem, Laird wrote later, was not Vietnamization but the United States' failure to provide continued financial support while the Soviet Union was sending Hanoi far more than the limit it had agreed to.\n\n\"We grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory ... when Congress cut off the funding for South Vietnam that had allowed it to continue to fight on its own,\" he wrote in 2005 in the publication Foreign Affairs.\n\nWhile at the Pentagon, Laird ended the military draft and established the all-volunteer force. \"It's been a very successful program,\" he said in 1997. \"I am very proud that I was there as secretary of defense to start it.\"\n\nIn 1973, Nixon brought Laird to the White House as counselor on domestic affairs. Several months later, the Watergate crisis deepening, Laird resigned.\n\nThe Laird Center, a complex for medical research at Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin, is named after Laird, who grew up in Marshfield.\n\nLaird often said Marshfield Clinic doctors encouraged him to get involved in health issues after he was elected to Congress, including his involvement in legislation that made health maintenance organizations possible.\n\nIn recognition of his efforts to promote the nation's health, Laird received numerous awards, including the prestigious Albert Lasker Medical Research Award.\n\nThree presidents \u2014 Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson \u2014 appointed him to the U.S. delegation of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nLaird was born in Omaha, Neb., on Sept. 1, 1922, and the family moved to Marshfield when he was a young child. He graduated from Carleton College in Minnesota in 1942 and served aboard the Navy destroyer U.S.S. Maddox in the Pacific during World War II.\n\nLaird was elected to his first political office in 1946, when he succeeded his late father, Melvin Sr., as a state senator in the Wisconsin Legislature. At the time, Laird, only 23, was the youngest state senator in the United States.\n\nMore recently, Laird served as senior counselor for national and international affairs and director of the Readers Digest Association.\n\nWhen the Laird Center was dedicated, Henry Kissinger recalled the many power struggles he had, as Nixon's national security adviser, with Secretary of Defense Laird, needling him on a day when political nostalgia and good humor filled the air.\n\n\"I always sent deputies to deal with him, and I would give them several pieces of advice,\" Kissinger said in his deadpan voice. \"First, you must remember Mel Laird is extremely smart. Second, he knows he is extremely smart. Third, he will let you know he is extremely smart. Fourth, it is much less painful to let him do what he wants. Fifth, when he says, 'You know what I mean,' there is no conceivable way you could know what he means. And sixth, when he calls to complain about a newspaper story, you know he has put it out himself.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 20, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.6172839403152471, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 894, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.6961637083, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161116230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.8031319910514503, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/03/no-mr-obama-its-not-sexism-thats-turning-tide-against-hillary-clinton.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4499]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 722, "scraper_regex": 762}}, "headline": "No, Mr. Obama, it's not sexism that's turning the tide against Hillary Clinton", "wordcount_as_scraped": 762, "date": "20161103170000", "story_content": "President Obama blames sexism for Hillary Clinton's tight presidential race. But that's not the \"ism\" that's holding her back. Donald Trump has opened an eight-point advantage over Clinton on which candidate is honest and trustworthy, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll. \"Truthism\" \u2014 defined as the voters' preference for candidates who tell the truth and obey the law \u2014 is interfering with Hillary's plan to become the first woman president.\n\nObama suggests it's time. No argument there. But Hillary's not the one to make history. Voters need to remember her history. She's gotten where she is by riding her husband's coattails \u2026 and by lying. Electing Hillary Clinton would validate the wrong ways to get ahead. It would endanger our nation's precious heritage: the rule of law.\n\nHillary resembles Eva Peron more than a pioneering feminist like Susan B. Anthony or Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\n\nOn the campaign trail, as Hillary vows to \"crack every last glass ceiling\" and win equality for women, she often invokes her supposed struggles to become the first female partner at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas. What's the real story? She got that law job in \u2014 surprise \u2014 1977, just after hubby Bill Clinton was sworn in as the state's attorney general. She was catapulted to partner two years later, when Bill was sworn in as governor.\n\nFast forward to 1993. Newly inaugurated President Bill Clinton announced a Task Force on National Health Care Reform and made Hillary the chair. This was his wife's big moment, but she insisted on keeping secret the names of her advisers, barred the public and press from her task force meetings and presented an entire revamp of the nation's health care system to Congress without even getting the lawmakers' input. Her arrogance set back the cause of health reform for many years.\n\nThen, in 2000, Hillary spotted another chance to capitalize on her husband's position. She moved to New York, where she had never lived or worked, and ran for the U.S. Senate, rolling over any locals who might have sought the nomination. Chuck Schumer took pains to deny the obvious on election night, declaring \"she won this election not because she was first lady, but because she worked hard.\" Right.\n\nAfter an unremarkable stint as New York's senator and a failed presidential bid in 2008, Hillary took the consolation prize of secretary of state in 2009. Four years later, she left the State Department in shambles, according to numerous Inspector General reports, with diplomatic posts unsecured, $6 billion unaccounted for and the department's official records missing.\n\nHillary is in hot water with the FBI because, as secretary of state, she conducted all her business on a private email system, shunning the government system that is subject to oversight and Freedom of Information Act requests. She even sent and received classified information on that private, easily hacked system, which put the nation's security at risk. And after leaving office, she dodged requests for her records. Instead, she destroyed thousands of emails and smashed as many as 13 computers and handheld devices.\n\nThe details of the FBI's ongoing investigation of her private email system are complex, but everybody who's ever worked knows that when you leave a job, you don't destroy the records and smash your computer. Honest people don't have to do that.\n\nWhy did she? Some have speculated that she was hiding a pay-to-play scheme where the Clintons raked in multimillion-dollar gifts to their foundation and megabucks speaking fees for Bill Clinton in return for access to the secretary of state. News leaked this week that the FBI is conducting an extensive investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nHillary is also under investigation for perjury and obstruction of justice by the House of Representatives. She's even in legal hot water in her new hometown, Chappaqua, N.Y., for renovating her house without getting the required permits from town hall. Just one more example of why she's surrounded by scandal. She thinks laws are for the little people. She doesn't have to obey them.\n\nClinton's disdain for the law and her sense of entitlement are finally catching up with her. Women who make it on their own know that these attitudes can torpedo a career. President Obama is trying to tell voters that sexism is to blame for their reluctance to vote for Hillary. Don't believe it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBetsy McCaughey, Ph.D. is chairman of Reduce Infection Deaths and a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research. A former Lt.

After initially reporting just 185 deaths, the government recently acknowledged that 865 children have died under the care of the National Service for Minors over 11 years.\n\nCalling Lissette's death shameful, President Michelle Bachelet has committed $ 3.7 million for an overhaul of the agency charged with looking after more than 100,000 children in the government's care each year in Chile, some in their own homes and some in shelters.\n\n\"As a society and as a state, we have failed these vulnerable children,\" Bachelet said.\n\nThe agency had come under fire in previous years, but remained unchanged, partly because the extent of the problems at the institutions it oversees were not publicly known. Some critics say that the latest measures come too late and that the agency is beyond repair.\n\n\"This institution must disappear to give way to a public structure that does take the responsibility that the state is taking,\" said Rene Saffirio, a ruling party lawmaker who led efforts pushing the government to release the agency's statistics on the children's deaths.\n\nThe death of Lissette caused a public outcry that led a congressional commission to launch an investigation. It also forced the resignation of Justice Minister Javiera Blanco and Marcela Labrana, the former head of National Service for Minors.\n\nWhen Lissette died, Labrana said that the girl had suffered from stress caused by being sexually abused by a member of her family. She also said the child suffered a breakdown because her family was not visiting her at the shelter.\n\nChile's investigations police, the country's equivalent of the FBI, later said that the girl suffered from bipolar disorder and was taking medicines. Its forensics department noted that \"Lissette was not a healthy girl,\" and that \"this time the crisis was predictable.\"\n\nLissette spent more than half of her life in and out of the agency's shelters, including the last few years. Her mother, Juana Poblete, decided she could no longer care for her and began placing her under the state's care when she was as young as 5.\n\nPoblete, who lives in a wooden shack on Santiago's outskirts, told The Associated Press her daughter was institutionalized because of violence in the family. \"Her dad abused her and tried to kill her twice,\" she said.\n\nLissette died the night of April 11, when her caretaker and a colleague were alone by themselves at the shelter. They called an ambulance after the child became unresponsive.\n\nThe subsequent police report showed that the weight of an adult on her back caused her to choke and breathe vomit through the lungs before she suffered a fatal heart attack. It also showed that the girl could have been saved if the staff had provided cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n\nA special prosecutor is investigating the deaths of Lissette and all the other children who died in the agency's care.\n\nOne of the caretakers who was with Lissette when she died later acknowledged in comments to Chile's local Channel 13 that she did not have first aid training. It was unclear whether she was the adult who allegedly sat on the child's back.\n\n\"Perhaps I harmed her,\" she said in an interview that concealed her identity.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.03012895584106, "HarmVice": 11, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 637, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.4275620588699995, "HarmVirtue": 12, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161103050000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.49450549450549, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/26/scholars-fret-about-fate-holy-grail-german-abbey-books.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [83]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1160, "scraper_regex": 1227}}, "headline": "Scholars fret about fate of 'holy grail' German abbey books", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1227, "date": "20161226120000", "story_content": "ALTOMUENSTER, Germany \u2013 \u00a0It was filthy, cramped and in major disarray, but when art historian Eva Lindqvist Sandgren entered the library in Altomuenster Abbey, off-limits to all but the German monastery's nuns for more than five centuries, she immediately knew she was looking at a major treasure.\n\nThe dusty shelves held at least 500 books, by her estimate, including precious illuminated manuscripts from the 16th century, chants used by the uniquely women-led Bridgettine Order and processionals bursting with colorful religious and ornamental decoration in their margins.\n\nUnlike most Bridgettine libraries, the tomes had survived the Protestant Reformation, the 30 Years War and Germany's \"secularization,\" when the state took most church property. It represents the most complete collection of the order known today.\n\n\"I had entered a time capsule,\" said Lindqvist Sandgren, a senior lecturer at Sweden's Uppsala University.\n\nSurprised by the spontaneous decision by Altomuenster's last remaining nun, Sister Apollonia Buchinger, to open the library, 20 scholars including Sandgren made plans to return and meticulously catalog the remarkable collection. But before they could, the Vatican ordered the abbey in the Bavarian town of 7,500 closed and locked up the library, which also contains some 2,300 statues, paintings and other works of art.\n\nIf plans go ahead to close it down, all of the abbey's property \u2014 the books, the artworks, the city block-sized abbey, and the acres of forests and fields that make up the monastery grounds would be turned over to the dioceses of Munich and Freising.\n\nAltomuenster is the end of a subway line from Munich, one of Germany's most expensive cities, and its land alone is thought to be worth tens of millions of euros (dollars) \u2014 assets that Sister Apollonia thinks the dioceses are eager to get their hands on.\n\nSince 1496, the former Benedictine abbey in Altomuenster has housed a female religious order founded by Saint Bridget in Sweden in the 14th century. It is one of three monasteries of the original branch of the scholarly, monastic order operating today. But with its numbers in decline, Sister Apollonia now lives there alone. The Vatican requires at least three nuns to train novices to become nuns, prompting the decision to shut the abbey down.\n\nThe Franciscan nun the Vatican put in charge of the closure, Sister Gabriele Konrad, says the collections are just being kept safe, but she's refused to grant the scholars or anyone else access to the books.\n\n\"The value of the library is the ensemble, because it's never been taken apart and probably nobody's removed a significant number of books \u2014 it's a working library,\" said Corine Schlief, an art historian at Arizona State University who visited the library with Sandgren. \"If this should be taken apart and divided up between books that collectors would give tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for and those only of interest to scholars, it would lose a lot of its value.\"\n\nSchlief, Sandgren and other academics have written an open letter to the Vatican, Sister Gabriele and the Munich dioceses \u2014 which will inherit Altomuenster's property once it's closed \u2014 urging that the library be kept together and made available to the public and offering to catalog it.\n\nVolker Schier of Arizona State University, another expert, estimated the Altomuenster collection represents around 80 percent of all known Bridgettine books.\n\nSister Gabriele and the Munich dioceses insist there is no plan to sell the books, and that their experts are perfectly qualified to handle them.\n\nScholars had known previously there was a library and had been able to ask nuns to bring them specific books to study in common areas of the monastery. But in October 2015, with such a large group of Bridgettine academics visiting, Sister Apollonia decided it made more sense for them to just look for themselves.\n\nAfter the Vatican, a month later, ordered the monastery closed and Sister Apollonia appealed for more time, the 62-year-old nun with rosy cheeks appealed to the public for support, starting a blog, a Facebook page and a Twitter account to generate interest. She also gave The Associated Press unprecedented access to areas in the labyrinthine monastery previously restricted to nuns.\n\nSister Apollonia is convinced that, with help from other Bridgettine Orders to bolster her numbers, she can again start training her own novices. She currently has one postulant, a 38-year-old who left a law career last year, but she cannot advance to become a novice without more nuns to train her.\n\n\"They say there are too few, but there are some other women who want to join,\" Sister Apollonia said, expressing hope that perhaps the Vatican might be reconsidering the order to shut down.\n\nThe Vatican office in charge has refused to comment on its plans.\n\nSister Gabriele says the decline of Altomuenster has been going on for decades and previous attempts to bring in others had failed. Two Bridgettines from Mexico came in 2012, only to return home after two weeks because they were homesick.\n\nMunich-Freising Vicar General Msgr. Peter Beer, Cardinal Reinhard Marx's deputy in charge of administration, dismissed speculation of any land-and-treasures grab by the dioceses. He said for cultural, social and religious reasons it was the dioceses' responsibility to preserve monasteries when they close.\n\n\"There's a false impression that we're taking in riches and gems and gold and everything imaginable \u2014 that's nonsense,\" he told the AP at his office in Munich. \"We are taking on costs more than anything.\"\n\nHis office also downplayed the library's potential value or historical significance, telling the AP it includes \"a large number of antiphonaries from the 18th century, most in very used and some in damaged condition,\" and that six antiphonaries \u2014 books containing religious chants \u2014 from the Middle Ages have \"already been studied by scholars.\"\n\nThat's made the group of scholars who wrote the open letter and others even more suspicious. From the hundreds of photographs they took, they know there's much more \u2014 including an illuminated manuscript from the 1500s in Belgium, which might be expected to fetch 100,000 euros ($105,000) or more if sold to a private collector, said Schier.\n\nSchier noted that even financially insignificant books are historically important. Ledgers, cookbooks and even antiphonaries help tell how the nuns lived over the centuries.\n\n\"Altomuenster is the holy grail,\" he said.\n\nBeer bristled at the offer of help from the group of scholars.\n\n\"You can be assured that we do not need any help from the U.S.A. to understand how to treat cultural assets of significance for Europe. We have a slightly longer history and slightly longer experience,\" Beer said.\n\nReferring to the letter from American and European academics, he added, \"It's a little irritating to have things thrown out in public in an open letter without the facts.\"\n\nThe dioceses plan to digitize all books dating from before 1803 and make them available online for researchers \u2014 but Schlief says that's not enough.\n\n\"Digitization is laudable, but it never replaces the books themselves, which now need to be carefully studied and catalogued,\" she said.\n\nFor her part, Sister Apollonia said if the Vatican decides to give her more time in the monastery, she'd be more than happy to open the library to the scholars again.\n\n\"They need to be made available to the public,\" Sister Apollonia said. \"Maybe we could charge a fee and it could be a source of income.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow David Rising on Twitter at https://twitter.com/davidrising\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.608364999294281, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1160, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.99310502421, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 4, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161226120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.5, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2017/01/03/denver-beermakers-create-pro-women-making-noise-pussy-riot-beer-ahead-trumps-inauguration.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [350, 431, 1258, 1907, 2015, 3484, 3486, 3488, 3490, 3492, 3494, 3496, 3498, 3500, 3502, 3504, 3506, 3508, 3510, 3512, 3514, 3516, 3518, 3520, 3522, 3524, 3526, 3528, 3530, 3532, 3534, 3536, 3538, 3540, 3542, 3544, 3546, 4147, 4284, 4320, 4350, 4500, 4503]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 646, "scraper_regex": 716}}, "headline": "Denver beer makers create pro-women, 'Making Noise: Pussy Riot' beer ahead of Trump's inauguration", "wordcount_as_scraped": 716, "date": "20170104170000", "story_content": "Female brewers in Denver, Colo. are taking a stand against oppression, sexism and anti-LGBT sentiments by collaborating to produce a series of craft brews that will be released leading up to president-elect Donald Trump's inauguration later this month.\u00a0\n\nThe first batch of \"Makin Noise: A Pussy Riot Beer\" was produced on Dec. 28 at\u00a0Goldspot Brewing.

When she first heard about \"Making Noise\" through Heiber's first call-to-action post on Facebook, Lay says knew she wanted to be apart of the effort.\n\nBREWERY APOLOGIZES FOR 'DATE GRAPE' BEER, ADMITS RAPE CULTURE ISN'T FUNNY\n\nThe group's mission statement, first posted on Dec. 6 by Heiber, read:\n\nWe felt it necessary to take action and decided to use our art to make our voices heard. We are coming out in support of those most at risk in our community and doing what we can to stand together as a united voice against hate and intolerance. This beer works to combat the hate and oppression while also lending support and solidarity to the fight for equality. We believe in this beautiful community, and we feel it is necessary to work together to protect it.

The attacker, Abdule Razak Ali Artan, was killed Monday after he drove into a group of pedestrians on campus, then began stabbing people with a butcher knife.\n\nArtan was born in Somalia and was a legal permanent resident of the U.S., according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the case and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. He was a student at Ohio State who had once criticized the media for its portrayal of Muslims.\n\nA law enforcement official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said Artan railed on Facebook against U.S. interference in Muslim lands and warned, \"If you want us Muslims to stop carrying lone wolf attacks, then make peace\" with the Islamic State group.\n\nThe official was briefed on the investigation but wasn't authorized to discuss it publicly.\n\nHere are things to know about Somalis in the U.S.:\n\n___\n\nSOMALI DIASPORA\n\nJob opportunities and the relatively low cost of living have drawn Somali immigrants to Columbus, Ohio, which has the second-largest Somali population in the U.S., estimated at anywhere from 13,000 to 40,000.\n\nMinnesota has the nation's largest Somali community, with census numbers putting the population at 57,000, mostly in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Somalis began coming to Minnesota in the 1990s after a civil war broke out in Somalia. Other waves of refugees followed and the community prospered, thanks to the state's welcoming social programs.\n\nThe community has largely prospered. Somali-owned restaurants, mosques, clothing shops, coffee shops and other businesses are well-established in some Minneapolis neighborhoods, including one dubbed \"Little Mogadishu,\" named after the capital of Somalia.\n\nLarge Somali communities are also concentrated in Lewiston and in Portland, Maine, and in the Seattle and Washington, D.C., metro areas.\n\n___\n\nTERROR RECRUITING\n\nIn the past decade, law enforcement and Somali community leaders around the country have struggled with terrorist groups luring some of its young men overseas. The problem first surfaced in 2007, when more than 20 young men from Minnesota began going to Somalia to join al-Shabab, which is classified as a terror group by the U.S. government. The group wooed young Americans with jihadist videos that appealed to patriotic and religious ideals.\n\nIn more recent years, the Islamic State has found recruits in the U.S. Roughly a dozen young men and women from Minnesota's Somali community have left to join militants in Syria, and nine Minnesota men were recently sentenced on terror charges for plotting to join the Islamic State group.\n\nIn September, a Somali-American stabbed and injured 10 people at a central Minnesota mall before he was killed by an off-duty police officer. Authorities have said the actions of Dahir Ahmed Adan, 20, suggested he had been radicalized, but the investigation continues. If that attack is ultimately deemed a terrorist act, it would be the first carried out by a Somali on U.S. soil; and Artan's attack at Ohio State would be the second.\n\nAuthorities say others have been stopped before carrying out attacks. In Columbus, Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a U.S. citizen born in Somalia, awaits trial on charges alleging he received weapons, combat and tactical training in Syria, then returned to the U.S. with a plan to attack a military base or a prison.\n\n___\n\nCONCERNS, EFFORTS TO STOP RECRUITING\n\nFederal officials have said one of their biggest fears was that a radicalized American who left the country to join the Islamic State or al-Shabab might return home to carry out attacks on U.S. soil. That was before the Islamic State began urging sympathizers to carry out \"lone wolf\" attacks in their home countries with whatever weapons they have available. In recent months, authorities have raised concerns about online propaganda that encourages car-and-knife attacks, which are easier to pull off than bombings.\n\nStopping recruiting has been a high priority in cities with large Somali populations. Law enforcement has invested countless hours in community outreach, and trying to engage youth who may feel disenfranchised or caught between two worlds.\n\nIn Portland, Maine, police have hired Somali teens as summer cadets and worked with them through a leadership and esteem program. In nearby Lewiston, police have worked to recruit Somali police officers. Somali community leaders in Columbus meet frequently with federal law enforcement, and a mosque gives youngsters an outlet for their energies.\n\nMinneapolis has been participating in a federal pilot program designed to curb terror recruiting. As part of the pilot, about a half dozen organizations that work with Somali youth received grants for programs including youth sports activities, job opportunities and a program to empower Somali parents.\n\n___\n\nCOMMUNITY ACTIVISM\n\nSomali and Muslim community activists have been quick to condemn terror attacks wherever they occur, and that's true in the Ohio State case. Leaders of Muslim organizations and mosques in the Columbus area condemned the attacks while cautioning people against jumping to conclusions or blaming a religion or an ethnicity.\n\nAfter the mall stabbing in St. Cloud, Minnesota, the Somali community was on edge. Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of Council of American-Islamic Relations' Minnesota chapter, said some local Somali-Americans were nervous about being viewed as \"guilty by association.\"\n\nAfter Monday's attack, he said: \"We must not let the act of one individual, no matter what his motive or background, to further divide our community or our nation. ... We have faith in our fellow Americans to do the right thing. This is a very dangerous time to be Muslim or perceived to be Muslim in the United States, and this week must be an opportunity for all Americans to show that they can stand together against violence of all forms.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Steve Karnowski contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Amy Forliti on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/amyforliti .

Here's the incredible reason why", "wordcount_as_scraped": 811, "date": "20161115110000", "story_content": "The liberal media is setting Donald Trump up to succeed. How? By making Trump out to be such a vile, erratic, destructive loon that unless he reenacts the Slaughter of the Innocents he will outperform expectations.\n\nThe New York Times, CNN, the New Yorker and other mainstream outlets have set the bar absurdly low for Trump. He enters office with no yoke of optimism hung around his neck. By contrast, when Barack Obama was elected, people expected miracles, which was strange given his meager resume. It was also damaging, as it opened the young president to ridicule. That Nobel peace prize? Premature at best. Those tens of thousands cheering at the Brandenburg Gates? Soon to be disappointed.\n\nMuch of America is pessimistic about the four years ahead. They are being told that Trump threatens their very well being, that his presidency will endanger Muslims and gays and women, for instance. These charges are scary, and they are ill-founded \u2013 political hyperbole that has left a bitter residue. Trump has sometimes spoken injudiciously, (and offensively), but he has never been unsupportive of the LGBT community, and has a solid record of hiring and promoting women, including Kellyanne Conway, the first female to successfully run a national campaign. As for Muslims, suggesting that we limit refugees from countries fomenting Jihad is not an assault on people living in this country.\n\nThose who should be nervous about Trump's election are the people at the top of the political food chain. Trump vowed to Drain the Swamp, after all, and the swamp rats could hardly rejoice. Whether he will be able to lessen the grip of big-money donors, lifetime politicians and lobbyists on the workings of our government remains to be seen. But, trying to rein in the offensive spread of federal intrusion into the lives of everyday Americans appears high on his to-do list; good for him.\n\nBut, it is not those political elites who are gathering each day in front of Trump buildings in New York and across the country. Instead, it appears to be groups organized by numerous outfits like Black Lives Matter and the National Action Network.\u00a0 Some of the gatherings do not appear organic, since buses deliver the crowds to designated hot spots, and buses must be hired by someone.\n\nPerhaps the organizers want to underscore that Trump has only a weak mandate to rule. That message stems from his failure to win the popular vote. However, since the GOP has won the majority of seats in the House and the Senate, occupies 31 of 50 governors' mansions and controls two-thirds of state legislatures, the charge to Republicans seems clear. One Democrat strategist commented on Fox News the other night that his party was in the worst shape it had been in since Reconstruction. That looks like a mandate.\n\nAsked to explain their protestations, demonstrators would likely fall back on charges that Trump is a bigot, a fascist, that he threatens their well-being in some way. For this perception we can thank Trump's carelessness and we can also thank the media.\n\nThe over-the-top defamation of Donald Trump by the mainstream media has been extremely damaging to the reputations of once-admired newspapers and networks. They were on Hillary's side and by the end of the campaign, made no effort to disguise their bias.\n\nIn the New Yorker, David Remnick published an extraordinary rant the morning after under the title An American Tragedy, in which he describes Trump's election as a \"sickening event\" and a \"triumph\u2026of nativism, authoritarianism, misogyny, and racism.\" He describes the president-elect as \"vulgarity unbounded\" and a leader who will \"strike fear in the hearts of the vulnerable, the weak, and, above all, the many varieties of Other whom he has so deeply insulted.\"\n\nRemnick warns that commentators will try to rationalize the election outcome and \"downplay the virulence of the nationalism displayed\"; in that one sentence Remnick shows how far removed he is from those who celebrate \"nationalism\" -- but call it \"patriotism.\"\n\nIt is fair to say that the New Yorker editor will never understand how people could have rejected Hillary Clinton and instead voted for Trump. In New York, more than any other place, the echo chamber is iron-clad. Manhattan liberals counted on a Hillary win, because that's all they read in the New York Times and heard on CBS.\n\nRemnick says that the election will cast the country into a period of economic, political and social uncertainty. For many of us, that sounds like the past 8 years. \n\nTrump may surprise people like Remnick; let's hope so. One thing is for certain, thanks to voices like his, expectations are very low, and relatively easy to beat.\n\n\n\nLiz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

Saturday's court filing to withdraw the case said the Green Party-backed voters who filed it \"are regular citizens of ordinary means\" and cannot afford the $1 million bond ordered by the court by 5 p.m. Monday. Green Party-backed efforts to force recounts and analyze election software in scattered precincts were continuing. The court's order can be read\u00a0here.\u00a0\n\nThe Wisconsin recount began on Thursday, while a potential recount could begin in Michigan next week.\n\nNo Republican presidential candidate had captured Pennsylvania since 1988.\n\nStein announced Pennsylvania's recount purpose was to ensure \"our votes are safe and secure.\"\n\nThey have unsuccessfully sought to get various counties to allow a forensic examination of their election system software.\n\nTrump's lawyers and the state Republican Party claimed there was no evidence or allegations that tampering occurred with Pennsylvania's voting systems. Pennsylvania law does not allow a court-ordered recount, they argued, and a lawyer for the Green Party had acknowledged that the effort was without precedent in Pennsylvania.\n\nRepublican lawyers also argued that the case has threatened the state's ability to certify its presidential electors by the December 13 federal deadline.\n\nOn Saturday, a GOP lawyer, Lawrence Tabas, said the case had been meant \"solely for purposes to delay the Electoral College vote in Pennsylvania for President-Elect Trump.\"\n\nThe state's top elections official, Secretary of State Pedro Cortes, a Democrat, has said there was no evidence of any sort of cyberattacks or irregularities in the election. Cortes predicted that a recount would change few votes.\n\nAs of Friday, Trump's margin of victory in Pennsylvania was 49,000, or less than 1 percent, out of 6 million votes cast, according to state election officials.

The girl was reported to be alert and unhurt.\n\nPOLICE SEEK NEW INFORMATION ABOUT WOMAN'S 1981 DISAPPEARANCE\n\nThe two were near their SUV, stuck on a dirt road on private property where a man found them, police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said. The two apparently survived on snacks and drinks they'd brought with them, according to investigators.\n\nThe property owner had spotted the SUV from a distance and when he went to check on it, he found the two seated nearby, authorities said. Maj. William Knott of the Dinwiddie County Sheriff's Office said the man had seen news reports about the missing travelers, realized who the Brileys were and called 911.\n\n\"This person probably saved them,\" Knott said.\n\nGUILTY VERDICT IN MISSING MAUI PREGNANT WOMAN'S DEATH\n\nThe SUV, a silver Toyota RAV4, was more than a mile from the main road,\u00a0WTVR reported.\n\nThe two had been the focus of a multistate search. Police said they did not believe foul play was involved in the disappearance. The county where crews found them was south of Richmond, Virginia's capital.\n\nBarbara Briley was flown by helicopter to VCU Medical Center in Richmond where she was in serious condition, police said. Authorities said the child appeared alert and unhurt and received a medical evaluation before being reunited with a family member.\n\nBarbara Briley was \"not responsive to questions\" when authorities arrived, but Knott said the child was \"in good shape and very talkative\" and has since been reunited with a relative.\n\nThe Brileys had left New Jersey on Christmas Eve to visit relatives in North Carolina but never arrived. They were last seen last weekend at a gas station in Ruther Glen, Virginia, about 30 miles north of Richmond.\n\nSurveillance video from the gas station shows Barbara Briley walking inside about 5:40 p.m. Saturday. She exits and re-enters before eventually pulling away just after 6 p.m., authorities said.\n\nGas station clerk Joanna Strange told local media that Briley came inside to say she was lost and she then helped the woman with her GPS before Briley went on her way.\n\nPolice said the evidence points to Briley having pulled onto a dirt road, which she then followed a short distance into the woods in Dinwiddie County. There she drove over a small tree and got stuck in a remote area of the property when she tried to back up, according to police.\n\nFamily members have said Barbara Briley was a former driver for New Jersey Transit and had made the long trip numerous times. They also said she didn't have any known medical issues.\n\nA relative of Briley's reached by The Associated Press declined comment, and VCU Medical Center didn't immediately return a message.\n\nLt. Travis Nutter of the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, which released the video, said nothing in the footage indicated any kind of suspicious activity at the gas station where the travelers were seen.\n\n\"That video is the last anybody saw of her,\" he had said.\n\nState troopers had searched around Ruther Glen area and along the Interstate 85 corridor from south of the Virginia capital city of Richmond to the North Carolina line, state police spokesman Sgt. Stephan Vick said.\n\nThey used a helicopter and hunted for signs of guard rail damage or other evidence that a vehicle may have run off the road, he said.\n\nThe North Carolina Highway Patrol also aided in the search. The investigation was being led by Hamilton Township, New Jersey, police, who didn't immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.16472542285919, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 568, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.82466981236, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.049295774647891, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/31/french-far-right-short-on-funds-can-russia-help-again.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [64]}}, "headline": "French far right short on funds.

But it's still a daring prospect for a party whose finances have already drawn unwanted scrutiny.\n\nAlleged funding irregularities have prompted multiple legal investigations and an impending trial for several party officials and associates, and a 2014 loan from a Russian bank raised concerns over Moscow's potential influence on French democracy. Not to mention the U.S. decision this week to impose sanctions and expel Russians over alleged cyber-meddling in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe French National Front says it's the target of a smear campaign, and notes that other candidates have also had financial troubles.\n\nLe Pen's firm rejection of foreign influence would make fishing for finances outside French waters a no-go, were it not for her Russia-friendly stance and what party officials say is the refusal of French banks to lend money to the anti-immigration National Front.\n\nFunds are needed to finance campaigning for the April-May presidential vote and June parliamentary elections. Party officials deny recent reports that they have already received a new loan from a Russian establishment \u2014 but no one is denying that the party may be asking for one.\n\n\"We are looking everywhere. We are working discreetly,\" party treasurer Wallerand de Saint Just told The Associated Press. The National Front needs 20 million euros for its electoral campaigns, and already has a portion of it, he said in a telephone interview, without specifying the amount in hand. They're not ruling out funding requests from sources including Russia, the United Arab Emirates, or even the United States, he said.\n\nThe party borrowed 9 million euros in 2014 from the small First Czech Russian Bank, but the bank's license was revoked this year, Saint Just said. Other Russian banks might consider a new loan.\n\nMoscow has courted far-right parties in Europe in an influence-building campaign as friction between Russia and the West has mounted over Ukraine and the Syrian civil war. Some leaders like Le Pen have hobnobbed in Moscow and at embassy events at home. Chieftains of Hungary's anti-Semitic Jobbik and Austria's Freedom Party also have made the trip.\n\nLe Pen envisions a concept of Europe that stretches \"from the Atlantic to the Urals,\" that would encompass Russia instead of pressuring it over Vladimir Putin's authoritarian policies.\n\nIn a shifting of views in Russia's favor, some mainstream politicians, from France's conservative Francois Fillon, a top presidential contender, to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, are sympathetic to a friendly approach to Moscow.\n\nFinding ways to raise money has run like a leitmotif through Le Pen's quest to make the National Front an alternative to mainstream political parties \u2014 and has led to run-ins with the law.\n\nThe party treasurer, Saint Just, is among seven people called to stand trial for alleged schemes to bolster party coffers. Le Pen is not implicated, but the party has also been called in for judgment, along with two concerns run by old Le Pen friends. They allegedly helped raise funds through a complex system that judicial authorities deem illegal.\n\n\"I will be acquitted,\" Saint Just said. \"We have absolutely done nothing wrong.\"\n\nA trial date has not been set, but a judicial official said it was unlikely to take place before the elections, so as not to \"interfere with democracy.\"\n\nThere is concern now that any new effort to tap Russian banks for loans could do just that, however, by making France vulnerable to influence from the Kremlin.\n\n\"There is an ambient Russia-phobia that is now leading to theories of plots,\" the National Front's No. 2 official, Florian Philippot, said Thursday on the iTele TV station.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies suspect that Moscow hacked into private email accounts to interfere with the U.S. political process in favor of Trump \u2014 a claim shrugged off by Putin, who said recently that the hackers could have been located anywhere.\n\nA Russia-friendly approach to geopolitics runs in the Le Pen family. Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front's co-founder, his daughter Marine and her niece Marion Marechal-Le Pen have all made numerous visits to Moscow over the years. Russian guests were present at the party's congress in 2014.\n\nMarine Le Pen even remarked in a May interview with RT France, a Kremlin-backed television network, that France could recognize Crimea as Russian \"if I were elected president.\"\n\nRelations between Russia and the West degenerated after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea amid fighting between Moscow-backed separatists and Ukraine government troops.\n\nFrench satirical and investigative weekly Le Canard Enchaine last week published excerpts of what it said was a letter by U.S. Republican Rep. Mike Turner, on the Select Committee of Intelligence, worried about ties between Putin and Le Pen. He reportedly asked James Clapper, director of national intelligence, for supplementary information on a vast disinformation war against the U.S. and other countries whose interests are opposed to Russia's.\n\nThe letter as reported by Le Canard Enchaine cited Le Pen's remark on Crimea and claimed her party had asked Russia in February for a $30 million loan. France's governing socialist immediately demanded clarification, calling the reported amount \"astronomical.\"\n\nTreasurer Saint Just called the reported request \"mysterious.\" February would have been too early to seek a loan, he said, adding \"and I always said we want 20 million euros maximum. We don't want more.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.36453199386597, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 892, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.1360342382999997, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 5, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161231110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.36322869955157, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/01/05/brooklyn-train-crash-renews-talk-operator-health-precautions.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [74]}}, "headline": "Brooklyn train crash renews talk of operator health precautions", "wordcount_as_scraped": 591, "date": "20170105130000", "story_content": "NEW YORK \u2013 \u00a0A commuter train crash at a busy New York City terminal on Wednesday morning was the latest of several accidents that have focused attention on how rail agencies monitor the health of their operators, especially sleep disorders.\n\nThe cause of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) derailment, which injured more than 100 people at Brooklyn's Atlantic Terminal, remains unknown. But officials immediately drew comparisons to a similar crash in Hoboken, New Jersey, in September that involved a driver who apparently suffered from a sleep disorder.\n\n\"This is minor compared to what happened in Hoboken,\" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference. \"But the same question: why did the operator not stop the train before it hit the block?\"\n\nThe Hoboken crash, which killed one person and injured more than 100, remains under investigation. An attorney for the engineer of the NJ Transit train has cited undiagnosed severe sleep apnea, which restricts breathing during sleep, causing daytime drowsiness and attention deficits. The condition can be triggered by obesity, family history and age and is more often seen in men.\n\nThe disorder has been linked to other crashes as well, including the 2013 derailment of a Metro-North Railroad commuter train in New York City. A National Transportation Safety Board report concluded that the driver had undiagnosed sleep apnea that contributed to the accident.\n\nThe NTSB has also found sleep apnea likely played a role in several freight crashes, including a 2011 collision in Iowa and a 2013 accident in Missouri.\n\nA union representative for LIRR engineers could not be reached on Wednesday.\n\nLast month, U.S. regulators at the Federal Railroad Administration issued an advisory citing the Hoboken crash and recommending that rail agencies screen crews for sleep apnea.\n\nThe agency in March began the process of drafting a rule in conjunction with the U.S. trucking regulator that would require railroads and truck companies to ensure medical examinations for drivers include sleep apnea screening.\n\nA spokesman for the FRA said there was no timeline for issuing a final regulation.\n\nAirlines are already required to screen pilots for sleep apnea. Those diagnosed with the disorder are barred from flying unless they show the problem has been treated and obtain a special permit.\n\n\"It's playing a part in every transportation area, including trains,\" said Bob Swint, a rail accident expert and consultant.\n\nAfter the 2013 crash, the Metropolitan Transportation Agency, which operates both Metro-North and the LIRR, conducted a pilot program to test operators for sleep apnea. In April, the agency said it would expand the effort to all MTA employees, including LIRR, though the screening has not yet started.\n\nThe MTA is in the process of selecting a medical firm to handle the screening and expects to award a contract in the coming months, according to spokesman Aaron Donovan, who said the program was the first of its kind in the nation.\n\nAfter the Hoboken crash, NJ Transit also improved its sleep apnea screening process, which had been in place since at least 2005, a spokesman, Jim Smith, said in an email. Any rail employees with \"safety-sensitive\" jobs who exhibit sleep apnea symptoms are removed from operation until they can certify that the condition has been corrected or controlled.\n\nNJ Transit also made other safety changes including adding a second crew member in the cab when a train arrives at terminals in Hoboken and Atlantic City.\n\nU.S. train engineers are required to undergo vision and hearing testing every three years, but federal regulations do not specify other medical examination standards.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.33386850357056, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 586, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.6747968966199993, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0716723549488103, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/12/02/latino-veterans-among-thousands-forming-human-shield-around-n-dakota-protesters/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [814, 1625, 2611, 3406, 3701]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 589, "scraper_regex": 623}}, "headline": "Latino veterans among the thousands forming human shield around N.

They said they chose Dec. 3 because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has announced they would close the protest camp Dec. 5. \u00a0Officials have said they will not forcibly remove protesters, but all those refusing to leave will be subject to prosecution and arrest.\n\n\"When we get there, we're not just Latinos, blacks or whites, we are veterans,\" Erick Lizandro Marroquin, on the Veterans Standing for Standing rock members told Russia Today. \"So, they will be shooting or threatening the uniform of the United States military.

Local law enforcement announced plans to block supplies from entering the camp, but reversed course and said they would simply check vehicles for prohibited supplies and issues fines as much as $1K for violating the governor's order.\n\nDalrymple has said that it's probably too late to reroute the pipeline, but according to Reuters, he has requested a meeting with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council to restore their tenuous relationship.\n\nCalderon calls himself a \"Chicano-power Latino\" and says he expects to get on the bus from Los Angeles to North Dakota, and arrive to connect with loving people, join hands, pray and provide spiritual strength to the protestors.\u00a0\n\nAbout the anticipated violence of having the veterans there, standing between the protestors and law enforcement, Calderon says, \"The elders there are no strangers to talking down an angry warrior and turning them into peaceful men and women.

Bush era and a longtime Trump Organization official to become members of his inner circle when he assumes office next month.\n\nThomas Bossert will become an assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. A statement from Trump's transition team said Bossert will advise the president on issues related to homeland security, counterterrorism and cybersecurity, and coordinate the Cabinet's process for making and executing policy in those areas.\n\nThe president-elect also appointed one of his main advisers on U.S.-Israel relations during the campaign and transition as special representative for international negotiations. Jason Greenblatt has worked for the Trump Organization for over two decades and currently serves as its executive vice president and chief legal officer.\n\nThe homeland security position notably \"is being elevated and restored to its independent status alongside the national security adviser,\" the statement said. Policymakers have long debated whether such national security jobs should operate independently from the White House.\n\nBossert will work closely with Trump's pick for national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. Bossert is currently president of the risk management consulting firm CDS Consulting. He previously served as deputy assistant to the president for homeland security under Bush.\n\nDonald Trump's West Wing is shaping up to have multiple power centers. Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior adviser Steve Bannon will work as \"equal partners,\" according to Trump, and counselor Kellyanne Conway is also expected to have autonomy. Trump's influential son-in-law, Jared Kushner, will have a direct line to the president as well.\n\nTrump has long stoked rivalries among his staff in business and during his presidential campaign. But some critics fear doing so in the White House could sow confusion and slow decision-making.\n\nDiscussing the appointment of Greenblatt, Trump said he \"has a history of negotiating substantial, complex transactions on my behalf,\" and has the expertise to \"bring parties together and build consensus on difficult and sensitive topics.\"\n\nTrump recently named his other top adviser on Israel, David Friedman, as his pick for U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n\nThe billionaire-turned-president-elect is spending the holidays at his Florida resort, where he's held a steady stream of meetings with senior staffers, advisers and business executives. A number of key posts in his administration remain; his transition team says he will fill those positions in the coming days.\n\nMeanwhile the president-elect continued the debate over whether he would have won an election against President Barack Obama.\n\nTrump posted on Twitter Tuesday, \"President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in very important swing states, and lost. The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether Trump was referring to Obama's own presidential runs, or the campaigning the president did in 2016 on Hillary Clinton's behalf. Obama swept most key swing states in his two bids for the White House, but Clinton fell short, losing to Trump.\n\nA dispute erupted a day earlier between Obama and Trump, spurred by Obama's hypothetical musings that had he run again, he would have been victorious. Obama suggested he still holds enough sway over the coalition of voters that elected him twice to get them to vote for him once again.\n\nTrump's response: \"NO WAY!\"\n\nLater Tuesday, Trump thanked himself for a surge in a key gauge of consumer confidence. He wrote on Twitter that The Conference Board had reported that its consumer confidence index had climbed to 113.7 in December.\n\nTrump noted that's the highest the index has climbed in more than 15 years, then added, \"Thanks Donald!\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Laurie Kellman in Washington and Julie Pace in Buffalo, New York, contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.152207002043724, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 581, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.19089614087, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161228090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.7865748709122204, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/30/lifting-russia-sanctions-wont-be-beneficial-to-all.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [73]}}, "headline": "Lifting Russia sanctions won't be beneficial to all", "wordcount_as_scraped": 908, "date": "20170130170000", "story_content": "DUBROVSKOYE, Russia \u2013 \u00a0Russian businessman Oleg Sirota is such a big fan of Donald Trump that he's built a snowman of the new U.S. president outside his factory.\n\nIt's an irony then that he fears Trump could spell his business' ruin.\n\nSirota is one of Russia's winners from international sanctions. A ban on Western food imports has made it possible for the former programmer to fulfil his dream of becoming a cheesemaker.\n\nSirota has become something of a darling in Russian media with his patriotic gestures, notably his wheel of cheese that is inscribed with Russian President Vladimir Putin's name. Sirota insists it must be collected in person.\n\nDemand is so high that Sirota has a three-month waiting list for new customers and he plans to increase production 10 times over this year with new facilities and a hiring push \u2014 provided the warm words between his two political heroes, Trump and Putin, don't bring about an end to sanctions.\n\n\"I was backing Trump in my heart, but Hillary in my head,\" Sirota said. \"If sanctions are canceled, this will all collapse.\"\n\nSanctions have reduced foreign competition in some sectors of the Russian economy, helping entrepreneurs like Sirota to expand rapidly to plug the gap. Often heavily in debt, many will struggle without sanctions, and some are considering whether to go public with their protests.\n\nSanctions were not mentioned directly during Trump's first phone call with Putin last Friday, though the Russian government said the two leaders discussed \"restoring mutually beneficial trade and economic ties.\"\n\nThe U.S. and the European Union slapped Russia with sanctions in 2014 when it annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The sanctions have focused on individuals close to Putin, as well as major companies in the energy, defense and banking sectors.\n\nRussia responded with bans on fresh food imports from the U.S., EU and other Western countries. Since then, food prices in Russia have risen sharply, but the agriculture and fisheries sectors have performed strongly against the backdrop of much-reduced competition.\n\nSirota, who has borrowed large sums from banks and relatives, and taken government grants, predicts that the removal of a Russian ban on food imports would flood Russia with cheap milk imports, sweeping away fledgling businesses like his.\n\n\"It's like sending a small boy out to box a world champion,\" he said. \"We need five or six years of sanctions, minimum, to break through. This shield has been protecting us and we need it to keep doing so.\"\n\nSirota sees himself as the proud heir to a Russian agricultural tradition devastated by war and revolution in the 20th century. He's strongly anti-globalization and backs Putin's signature foreign policy moves in Ukraine.\n\nNow he and other farmers are considering taking to the streets.\n\n\"If there's serious talk of canceling the sanctions, we'll definitely appeal to Vladimir Putin for support. Maybe we'll even have protests in favor of keeping them because it's hugely detrimental for us,\" he said. If sanctions go, Sirota wants higher tariffs on imported products, asking \"why can the Americans do it and we can't?\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Russian officials have made conflicting statements on whether their \"counter-sanctions\" will stay. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called on Russians to \"shed the illusions\" that sanctions against Russia would soon be lifted while Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov has said key government ministries should operate on the assumption that they will be.\n\nWithout providing details, Putin has said Russia would support farmers while admitting Russia's membership of the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules for global trade in a way that no one country is discriminated against, could leave the domestic agriculture sector vulnerable.\n\n\"For Putin, removing the sanctions, the Russian sanctions, would actually hurt several important constituencies within Russia,\" said analyst Dmitry Trenin, director of the Moscow Carnegie Center. \"Maybe removing them too fast, too soon, is not what Putin would want.\"\n\nThe Russian food ban mostly affects European countries and is unlikely to be scrapped before the removal of EU sanctions, which were last extended in December for a six-month period.\n\n\"There is a very big chance that this was the last extension of the sanctions,\" said Hendrik Vos, a professor in international relations at Belgium's Ghent University, pointing to countries like Italy, Greece and Hungary which favor closer ties with Russia. \"There are simply too many member states that also don't have an interest in extending sanctions.\"\n\nPotential winners of any dropping of sanctions would likely include Russia's oil and gas industry, which would find it easier to access foreign financing and expertise. Retailers could also benefit from extra competition among suppliers, while consumers would welcome lower food prices.\n\nLorenzo Getti, an Italian who runs cafes and a restaurant consultancy in Moscow, has swapped Italian produce for products from Mexico or the unsanctioned mini-state of San Marino, as well as buying salami from Russian suppliers.\n\n\"Unfortunately it is not the same level as the Italian ones and it will not be for some years,\" he said of Russian-sourced salami.\n\nIn his cheese storeroom outside Moscow, Sirota muses on how the annexation of Crimea made his dreams come true, but reconciliation could kill them.\n\n\"Crimea is in the heart of every Russian,\" he said, pointing to a cheese colored dark red with Crimean wine, \"and without Crimea none of this would have happened.\"\n\n___\n\nRaf Casert in Brussels, Belgium, and Ekaterina Chernyaeva in Moscow contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.28690218925476, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 865, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.6160353486, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170130170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.84971098265896, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/01/13/digital-maintenance-5-ways-to-spruce-up-and-protect-your-gear.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a9": [6388], "\u00a0": [944, 1388, 1680, 2325, 2391, 3240, 3805, 4008, 4512, 4545, 4694, 4697, 5327, 6175]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1035, "scraper_regex": 1097}}, "headline": "Digital Maintenance: 5 Ways to Spruce Up and Protect Your Gear", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1097, "date": "20170114010000", "story_content": "It's time to treat your online accounts, laptops, and phones the way you handle a garage or a closet. Digital accounts and electronics need regular cleaning and maintenance, just like shelves full of motor oil and cleaners.\n\nOtherwise, they turn into a frustrating mess, which can even harbor some hazardous materials. Honestly, when was the last time you even looked at your router settings? But that's something you should do, to keep yourself safe from hackers.\n\nThough the year is young and the days are short, set aside a morning for digital housework. In just a few hours, you can clean up your inbox, free up storage space, and protect your personal data from online criminals.\n\nHere's your digital maintenance to-do list for this weekend:\n\n\"If I had to pick the most important online safety strategy of them all, it would be safely managing your passwords,\" says Gary Davis,\u00a0chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security. (And, yes, that's his real title.) \"Having a truly complex password, and changing it regularly, is one of the most important things you can do to secure your online life.\"\n\nTry to create new passwords for each of your app and website accounts. This prevents one compromised password from creating multiple breaches.\n\nWhen it comes to passwords, the longer and more nonsensical, the better.\u00a0\n\nDavis recommends using a password manager, which can be a huge time-saver. \"Integrated password managers can automatically log users into websites and applications,\" he says, \"which is tremendously convenient and can generate ridiculously complex passwords that you never need to type in.\"\u00a0\n\nIt seems as if we hear of a new data breach almost every week. To see whether your personal info was swept up in the hacks at LinkedIn, Adobe, Dropbox, or Yahoo, plug your email addresses and user names into haveibeenpwned.com.\n\nThe website takes your user info and matches it up with the publicly leaked data. It also lets you sign up to receive notifications if your accounts get compromised in the future.\n\n\"Consumers should take seriously every online interaction they have,\" says Mike Baukes, the co-CEO of cybersecurity firm UpGuard. \"They should also be vocal in holding their favorite brands accountable for their security practices.\"\u00a0\n\nIt's also not a bad idea to review the privacy settings on your\u00a0Google and Facebook accounts.\n\nIf you're anything like me, you have few qualms about handing out your personal email address for a free app download or 10 percent off on a tube of toothpaste. But, sooner or later, that cavalier attitude nets you an overstuffed inbox.\n\n\nThough you could spend an afternoon opening every last email and clicking on the unsubscribe link, there's an easier way to clean house. It's called Unroll.me, and it wades through your inbox and compiles a list of subscriptions. From there, you can pick and choose what to keep and what to jettison.\n\nIn my case, it helped me whittle the list from 474 to 13.\n\nAnd the next time you feel tempted to swap an email address for an online deal, make it a point to use a site such as 10MinuteMail.com, which offers a secure, temporary email service that self-destructs in 10 minutes.\u00a0\n\n\nThe days of 16GB storage capacity are coming to a close, but even a 64GB smartphone isn't a bottomless pit. With large apps, 4K video, and high-res photos becoming the norm, we may all be destined to suffer through limited space headaches. Here are some solutions:\n\nDelete unused apps. Perform a quick audit and get rid of the ones you haven't accessed in a while. (This is also good for privacy and security\u2014the fewer apps you have, the fewer companies there are collecting data on you.) It's also worth checking out how much space the apps you do use command.\u00a0\n\nFor iOS users, go to Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage > Manage Storage.\n\nFor Android users, go to Settings > Storage & USB > Internal Storage (or Storage) > Apps.\n\nClear your browser cache.\u00a0When you visit a website, your smartphone temporarily stores files so that the next time you go to the site, it will load faster. As a result, the browser cache can get quite large. To fix that, you should clear it out every so often.\n\nEach mobile browser has a different method to accomplish this. But here are a couple of examples.\n\nSafari users should go to Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data.\n\nFor Android users with Chrome, go to the Chrome app and select More > Settings > Advanced\u00a0> Privacy > Clear browsing data.\u00a0Next, select a time period (such as the past hour or from the \"beginning of time\"). Select Cache and tap Clear data.\n\nSend your photos to the cloud.\u00a0If\u00a0estimates from market research firm Infotrends are accurate, more than 1 trillion photos will be shot in 2017. That's a lot of images, and they all have to go somewhere. You could squander precious onboard storage on your rarely viewed snapshots, but why not move them to the cloud?\n\nFor iOS users, make sure your iCloud Photo Library is on. Now go to Settings > iCloud > Photos and turn on Optimize Storage, so that when your phone is low on space, a smaller image file will take the place of each full-resolution picture (which will be sent to the cloud).\n\nFor Android users, make sure to have the Google Photos backup enabled.\u00a0Open the Google Photos app and select Menu > Settings and turn on Back up & sync. (Google Photos is also available to iPhone users; download the app.)\n\nNeglecting your router could put your home network and even your online accounts at risk. So it's important to regularly update the firmware to obtain the latest security features.\n\nThough some newer routers provide automatic updates, many older models require you to do the work. At the least, you'll need to log into your router through a browser using the device's IP address and accept any updates that the router company has prepared for you. But you may even need to download the update from the manufacturer's website, then do the installation. Here are links with step-by-step instructions on how to update the models from some popular brands: Apple, Asus, D-Link, Linksys, and Netgear. \u00a0\n\nTo prod yourself to check for future updates, set up a quarterly reminder in your calendar. You can also consult with the manufacturer to see whether there's a way to get security notices via email.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2005-2017 Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.

Huge crowds have been shouting his name and lining the roads to salute the funeral procession carrying his ashes from Havana to the eastern city of Santiago.\n\nIn the cities some of the ceremony has been undercut by grumbling about Cuba's autocratic government, inefficient bureaucracy and stagnant economy. The outpouring has seemed the most heartfelt in Cuba's east, the region his ashes are crossing Friday.\n\nCastro was born in eastern Cuba. His revolution started here, and it's here and in other parts of rural Cuba where his campaigns for literacy, social welfare and land redistribution had their deepest impact.\n\n\"Before the revolution, the countryside wasn't what you see now,\" Toledo said. \"My parents were sharecroppers, cane-cutters. They did what they could to support a family of 12, but they couldn't even sign their names. When they died they were literate and had a house with electricity, television and a refrigerator.\"\n\nFor many foreigners, landing in Havana feels like traveling back in time, to an era of 1950s cars and Art Deco homes unpainted for decades. Heading into the countryside is another step back \u2014 to a region where farmers plow with oxen and people travel by horse-cart. But, thanks to Castro's programs, there are also neighborhood health clinics, small-town libraries and specialized high schools with dance and arts instructors.\n\nBefore the revolution, El Guayabo was a family estate with a cheese factory owned by a Cuban family who fled to the United States after Castro and his rebel army took power. The land was distributed to those working it under agricultural reforms that Castro began in 1959.\n\nStill, while rural Cubans' lives have improved with the arrival of doctors and teachers in once-ignored backwaters, it has been a struggle to earn a living under the island's one-party socialist government and its stifling economic rules.\n\nMore than five decades after the revolution, much of the countryside is deeply unproductive and Cuba imports a large percentage of its food. Weeds choke unproductive fields and ranches are without cattle. Many young people are moving to the cities, or leaving Cuba entirely.\n\nYudisleidy Borges and her husband, Julio Cesar Camejo, want to start a small dairy in Santa Elena in central Cuba's Ciego de Avila province but are struggling with a centrally planned system that maintains a monopoly on all agricultural inputs.\n\n\"The issue of getting the supplies that we need, the feed and the equipment, is serious,\" Camejo said.\n\nYet, Borges said, the problems of life in the countryside don't sour the appreciation she feels for Castro's socialist system.\n\n\"In central and eastern Cuba, people have always followed Fidel,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Weissenstein in Havana contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAndrea Rodriguez on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ARodriguezAP\n\nMichael Weissenstein on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mweissenstein\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.313479632139206, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 564, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.1354541815299999, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4184397163120601, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/06/3-in-custody-in-robbery-wife-missouri-governor-elect.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [70, 137, 146, 2610, 3021]}}, "headline": "3 in custody in robbery of wife of Missouri governor-elect", "wordcount_as_scraped": 553, "date": "20161207010000", "story_content": "ST.

She was unharmed.\n\nSheena Greitens, 34, said she was thankful for the outpouring of support she received.\n\n\"We are also aware that what happened to me and to our family last night happens to far too many people and far too many families across this city and this state, and that cannot continue,\" she said.\n\nEric Greitens, a Republican who defeated Democratic Attorney General Chris Koster in the November election, was emotional during the three minutes in which he spoke to the media. He declined to take questions.\n\n\"As a husband my first thought was for Sheena's safety,\" Greitens said. \"My second thought was for justice. I'm glad that the men and women of law enforcement found these young men before I did.\"\n\nNeither he nor his spokesman, Austin Chambers, would elaborate.\n\nPolice said the suspects, ages 14, 15 and 19, were involved in several crimes Monday.\n\nSheena Greitens had just arrived shortly after 6 p.m. at a coffee shop in the Central West End, a wealthy area of the city, where she planned to do some work, Chambers said. She was looking at a cellphone in her car when a young man opened the door, pointed a gun, and demanded her belongings, police said.\n\nThe suspect took her phone and laptop and ran, along with the others. As police were investigating that crime they learned that another car in the same parking lot had been broken into. Police were able to track that victim's cellphone, which was in a moving car on a nearby street.\n\nWhen officers got behind that car it tried to flee, prompting a brief chase that ended in a crash, police said. The suspects ran but were quickly caught.\n\nPolice then determined that the car had been stolen and had been used in another robbery attempt moments before the attack on Sheena Greitens.\n\nThe 19-year-old suspect, Marquay Beard of St. Louis, was charged Tuesday with second-degree tampering with a motor vehicle. Susan Ryan, a spokeswoman for the circuit attorney's office, would not speculate if additional charges would be filed against him but said the investigation is ongoing.\n\nIt was unclear if the younger suspects would be charged as adults. Juvenile court records in\u00a0Missouriare not open to the public.\n\nEric Greitens fought back tears as he expressed sorrow for the families of the suspects. He said he hopes to meet with those families to discuss ways to battle crime.\n\n\"If we continue down our current path, it will continue to lead to more disorder, more lawlessness, more chaos, people living further and further apart from each other, divided by fear,\" he said.\n\nMissouri\u00a0Highway Patrol Capt. John Hotz said the patrol now is providing security for Sheena Greitens. The patrol provided security for the governor-elect immediately after the election, but Hotz said security detail for the spouse typically begins once the new governor takes office.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.09337854385376, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 538, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.6006197147, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.60223048327138, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/11/26/in-early-morning-hours-miami-cubans-hit-streets-to-celebrate-castro-death/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [94], "\u00ed": [7]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 750, "scraper_regex": 788}}, "headline": "'Cuba s\u00ed, Castro no!'

Honking and strains of salsa music from car stereos echoed against stucco buildings, and fireworks lit up the humid night sky.\n\nPolice blocked off streets leading to Cafe Versailles, the quintessential Cuban American hotspot where strong cafecitos \u2014 sweetened espresso \u2014 were as common as a harsh word about Fidel Castro.\n\n\n\n\"Cuba si! Castro no!\" they chanted, while others screamed \"Cuba libre!\"\n\nCelebration, not grief, permeated the atmosphere. That was no surprise. Castro has cast a shadow over Miami for decades, and in many ways, his policy and his power have shaped the city and its inhabitants.\n\nCubans fled the island to Miami, Tampa, New Jersey and elsewhere after Castro took power in 1959. Some were loyalists of Fulgencio Batista, the president prior to Castro, while others left with the hope they would be able to return soon, after Castro was toppled. He never was.\n\nMany others believed they would not be truly free under Castro and his communist regime. Thousands left behind their possessions, loved ones, and hard-earned educations and businesses, traveling to the U.S. by plane, boat or raft. Many Cubans died on the ocean trip to South Florida. And many never returned to see their childhood homes, their neighborhoods, their playgrounds, their businesses, their cousins and aunts and uncles, because Castro was still in power.\n\nThe ones that made it to Miami took a largely, and vehemently, anti-Castro stance.\n\nOn New Year's Eve every year, Cubans in Miami utter a toast in Spanish as they hoist glasses of liquor: \"Next year in Cuba.\" But as the Cuban exiles aged, and as Castro outlived them, and as U.S. President Barack Obama eroded the embargo and younger Cubans returned to the island, the toast rang silent in many households.\n\nIn Miami, where Havana is closer both geographically and psychologically than Washington, the news of Castro's death was long anticipated by the exiles who left after Castro took power, and in the decades since. Rumors have come and gone for decades, and Castro's death had become something of a joke \u2014 mostly because it seemed to happen so frequently.\n\nThis time, though, it was real.\n\n\"We're all celebrating, this is like a carnival,\" said 72-year-old Jay Fernandez, who came to Miami when he was 18 in 1961. He and his wife and another woman held up a bilingual sign he'd made four years ago when Castro first became ill. \"Satan, Fidel is now yours. Give him what he deserves. Don't let him rest in peace.\"\n\nSeveral blocks away, at the Bay of Pigs memorial, Antonio Hernandez, 76, rode his bicycle up in a light rain and stood at the eternal flame that honors the men who tried, and failed, to wrest Cuba from Castro's grip in 1961.\n\n\"Everybody's happy. Now this guy won't do any more damage,\" said Hernandez, who came to Miami on the Mariel boat lift in 1980. \"His brother will now go down, too. But the world has to pay attention to this, not just we Cubans.\"\n\nWrote Valentin Prieto, a prominent Cuban-American blogger, on Facebook: \"A few hours of sleep tonight is the very last thing fidel castro will ever rob me of.\" In his writings on his blog, Prieto never capitalized Castro's name.\n\nMany Cubans made successful livings and raised families in Miami despite having to learn a new language and start their lives over. Exiles who arrived as teenagers with no money in their pockets became millionaires, political leaders, clergy members, teachers \u2014 influential members contributing to the sturdy fabric of American society.\n\nCemeteries in South Florida abound with the remains of those who fiercely wished Castro had died before them. Their children weep today because they could not see their parents and grandparents return to Cuba under a democratic regime, to see their homeland one more time.\n\nGabriel Morales, a 40-year-old financial executive, monitored social media early Saturday from his home in Miami. His parents both left Cuba decades ago. His father left Cuba before Castro took over, and then returned to visit during Castro's regime. He vowed never to return until the regime changed, Morales said.\n\nMorales' mother left after Castro assumed power; her family had their property appropriated by the government, Morales said.\n\n\"Feels weird,\" Morales said in a text message to an Associated Press reporter. \"Been waiting to hear this news all my life. Seems unreal.\"\n\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.8159806728363002, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 750, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.38132675889, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161126130000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.46666666666667, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/05/richest-americans-live-seven-to-10-years-longer-than-poorest.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 507, "scraper_regex": 544}}, "headline": "Richest Americans live seven to 10 years longer than poorest", "wordcount_as_scraped": 544, "date": "20161205190000", "story_content": "Poverty cuts an average of almost 10 years off American men's lives and seven off women's, a new study shows.\n\nEager to tease out socioeconomic disparities that can hide in state-level data, researchers reclassified all the U.S. counties into 50 new \"states\" based on household income instead of geography. Then they examined longevity, smoking, obesity, childhood poverty and other health information from the richest and poorest places.\n\nMen in the poorest spots died on average nearly 10 years earlier, at 69 years old, than men in the wealthiest ones, and women in the poorest places died on average seven years sooner, at 76 years old, the research team reports in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\n\"The results should be deeply disturbing to all persons in the country,\" the study authors write. \"Life expectancy in the poorest 'state' falls below that of more than half the countries in the world, meaning that, in essence, there are several developing countries hidden within the borders of the United States.\"\n\nSenior author Dr. Randy Wykoff said in a phone interview that he expected to see differences in smoking and obesity rates - and that's indeed what the study showed. Adults in the poorest places were twice as likely to smoke and 50 percent more likely to be obese.\n\nBut the life-expectancy gap surprised him, said Wykoff, who is dean of the College of Public Health at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City.\n\nAlso stark were the numbers about race and children living in poverty.\n\nNon-Hispanic African-Americans were 4.5 times more likely to live in the poorest regions than in the richest, the study found. Also, more than 48 percent of children in the poorest spots lived below the federal poverty line, while less than 9 percent of children in the wealthiest did.\n\n\"Nearly half of young children grow up in low-income families that cannot provide them with adequate resources to thrive,\" Dr. Neal Halfon wrote in an email addressing the study.\n\nHalfon directs the Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was not involved in the research.\n\n\"It is not hard to see that individuals born in these low-income and deprived places with few resources are likely to have much lower lifelong health trajectories,\" he said. \"The public sector and civic sector have not been able to put together a comprehensive anti-poverty campaign.\"\n\nThe study authors suggest that public health programs should be targeted more narrowly than by state, focusing instead on the poorest counties.\n\nResearchers found that five states - Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas - housed both the richest and the poorest people in the nation, suggesting that poverty stems not only from a lack of resources but from their unequal distribution.\n\nWykoff warned that failure to address economic, educational and health disparities in the poorest spots could lead to a further widening of the gap between the nation's rich and poor.\n\n\"We hope this study reinforces the understanding that poverty really is a major factor that impacts health,\" he said.\n\nOther countries have had some success combating poverty, Halfon said.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" he said, the U.S. has \"not had the political will nor the inclination to take this on in spite of the devastating long- and short-term consequences.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.4246575832366903, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 507, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.7200807207700002, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 7, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205190000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.3806706114398402, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.636363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/03/gregg-jarrett-avalanche-evidence-may-now-bury-hillary.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [331, 333, 334, 393, 426, 1256, 1375, 1446, 1598, 1629, 2057, 2059, 2061, 2062, 2392, 2435, 2437, 2641, 2642, 2700, 3193, 3361, 3409, 3455, 3470, 3516, 3545, 3620, 4021, 4361, 4591, 4737, 4957, 4959, 5010, 5188, 5328, 5518, 5593, 5653, 5880, 6188, 6972, 7008, 7340, 7342, 7536, 7537, 7572, 7573, 7574, 7733, 8222, 8388, 8502, 9011, 9235]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1378, "scraper_regex": 1466}}, "headline": "Gregg Jarrett: An \"avalanche of evidence\" may now bury Hillary", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1466, "date": "20161103200000", "story_content": "Americans who lived through the nightmares of both the Watergate and Lewinsky scandals recall vividly how every day seemed to produce new evidence of wrongdoing. The drip, drip of deceptions and lies finally overflowed into a cascading pool of criminality and disgust. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe first scandal culminated in Articles of Impeachment.\u00a0 The other an impeachment trial.\u00a0 Is America now hurtling toward the same political abyss? It looks like it. So, fasten your seat belts and brace for impact.\n\nSources tell Fox News's Bret Baier that the FBI has uncovered an \"avalanche of evidence\" in the Clinton Foundation investigation.\n\nAgents are \"actively and aggressively pursuing this case,\" calling it a \"very high priority.\"\n\nArmed with newly discovered email evidence and additional documents revealed by WikiLeaks, these sources say that agents will likely try to get Huma Abedin and others to cooperate in an effort to bring criminal charges against Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt is a stunning development. But that's how avalanches happen. Suddenly, you're buried before you know it.\n\nIf this is true, and if Clinton is elected president in a few days but thereafter indicted, several scenarios could unfold.\u00a0\n\nShe could resign before or after inauguration, leaving President Tim Kaine sitting behind a desk in the Oval Office.\u00a0\n\nPresident Obama could pardon her before he departs that same office.\u00a0\n\nClinton, as president, could try to invoke broad constitutional immunity from prosecution, delaying her criminal trial until after she leaves office.\u00a0 Or she could pardon herself. \u00a0\n\nHowever, all of that may not matter much if a Republican House of Representatives moves to impeach her. Neither immunity nor pardons apply to the ultimate constitutional remedy of impeachment.\n\nThus, Americans will again be forced to suffer through another impeachment horror show. But Hillary may not be able to beat the rap the way her husband did back in 1999 when he was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat began as an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents\u2026 has now morphed into suspicions of rampant corruption involving Clinton's charity. Specifically, that she used her position as Secretary of State to confer benefits to donors who lavished money on her foundation and personally enriched the Clintons. \u00a0And the case against her is accelerating. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt was inevitable, I suppose, that her emails would intersect somehow with the incredible wealth amassed by the Clintons since they left the White House. There's always a paper trail. Or pesky emails. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOr, in the case of Richard Nixon, those damnable tapes.\u00a0\n\nTwo Investigations Merge\n\nHillary Clinton used her unauthorized, private email server not only to conduct State Department business involving thousands of classified documents, but it appears she also used the server for some of her foundation's communications. The FBI has devoted more than a year to investigating whether the Clintons illegally leveraged their foundation for personal gain -- that is into tens of millions of dollars in potential self-dealing and so-called \"pay-to-play\".\u00a0\n\nAs I pointed out in a previous column, all of this, if proved, could constitute bribery, fraud, and illegal use of a non-profit charity which smacks of racketeering.\u00a0\n\nWhat's that? Operating a criminal enterprise.\u00a0 It is often associated with organized crime.\u00a0 (See \"mafia\")\u00a0 There is also the related matter of perjury.\u00a0 And obstruction of justice.\u00a0 The same charges that were leveled against Bill Clinton back in the day. \u00a0\n\nImportantly, the newly discovered Weiner/Abedin electronic devices appear to contain email evidence relevant to both the classified documents case and the Clinton Foundation case. In addition, sources confirm that laptops belonging to Clinton's top aides, Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, are now in the possession of the FBI and are being \"exploited for more evidence.\" The floodgates are open.\u00a0\n\nWhile the foundation probe is now center stage, a reinvigorated look at whether Clinton mishandled classified documents has obviously been resurrected. It is possible that FBI Director Comey could reconsider his opinion of Clinton's legal \"intent\" under the Espionage Act and reverse himself in his recommendation on prosecuting Clinton.\u00a0 Sources say there is a 99 percent chance that up to 5 foreign intelligence agencies may have accessed Clinton's emails and stolen them, putting a lie to President Obama's claim that Clinton did not jeopardize national security. \u00a0\n\nThe Clinton Foundation\n\nAs \"Fox News Sunday\" anchor Chris Wallace pointed out in the final debate, \"emails show that donors got special access\"\u00a0 to Clinton while Secretary of State. While that is surely unseemly or improper, it is illegal only if Clinton used her position to confer a benefit in exchange for money. That is, if donors rewarded Clinton with cash. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSo, here is an example of what might be illegal.\u00a0 It has been reported that Clinton helped UBS avoid the IRS. Bill then got paid $ 1.5 million dollars and their foundation received a ten-fold increase in donations by the bank.\u00a0 If the money was a reward for Clinton's work on behalf of UBS, then that could be considered bribery under federal law. And racketeering. \u00a0\n\nAnother example: it has been reported that Clinton's state department approved billions of dollars in arms sales to several nations whose governments gave money to the Clinton Foundation.\u00a0 Again, if it can be proven there was a quid-pro-quo, it would be illegal.\u00a0\n\nThis is where the WikiLeaks hacked emails come into play.\u00a0 Messages show that charity official Doug Band, while raising money for the foundation, also steered millions of dollars to Bill Clinton. The cash came from foundation donors who had business before Hillary's state department.\u00a0 Band's emails, in which he brags about his prowess in funneling up to $66 million to Bill, make explicit how the Clintons appear to have used their foundation for personal profit.\n\nOrganized crime and Illegal syndicates tend to use legitimate-looking businesses as a \"front\" to try to fool law enforcement.\u00a0 Often, they devise a \"dual purpose\" company -- one which operates lawfully from the front door, but unlawfully out the backdoor. There is little doubt that the Clinton Foundation operated as a charity. But if there was a secondary, hidden purpose devoted to self-dealing and personal enrichment, and if the foundation was merely a conduit, then prosecution could be pursued under federal anti-corruption statutes.\n\nDid DOJ Obstruct The FBI?\n\nIt's beginning to look that way. Even after Comey announced in July that he would not recommend prosecuting Clinton, the investigation into her foundation was still being actively pursued by some agents within the FBI. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department became angry over this and agents were told to \"stand down.\"\u00a0 Whether that happened is disputed.\u00a0\n\nHowever, it appears that FBI agents wanted to examine emails on non-government laptops that were part of the Clinton classified documents case. They felt there might be evidence that the foundation was being used illegally by the Clintons, as noted above. But Justice Department prosecutors allegedly stopped them from doing it. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWhy? Was Justice protecting Clinton? Can we be assured that the renewed investigation of Clinton won't be obstructed by an attorney general with allegiances to both Hillary and Bill Clinton? \u00a0\u00a0\n\nTime For an Independent Counsel \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nGiven these reports of DOJ's interference, there are serious and legitimate doubts about the integrity of the government's ability to investigation Clinton.\u00a0\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch was compromised from the beginning. She was first elevated to the position of U.S. Attorney by Bill Clinton. She met privately with him just days before a decision was made as to whether his wife would be prosecuted.\n\nAs if that were not enough, Lynch's boss, President Obama, defended Clinton publicly last April on \"Fox News Sunday\" by declaring, in essence, she did not break the law. He made the same argument during an earlier \"60 Minutes\" interview.\u00a0 He prejudged the outcome of the case.\n\nThis sent a pretty clear message to those in charge of just how the president wanted the question of prosecution to turn out.\u00a0 Now, it appears that Lynch's Department is heeding that message by actively obstructing the FBI's investigation.\u00a0\n\nThe attorney general has failed or refused to appoint a Special Prosecutor to ensure that these investigations are fair and impartial. President Obama could demand one, as well. He likely will not. His conflict of interest is as glaring as Lynch's.\n\nAfter all, the president has been campaigning vigorously for Clinton to succeed him. Why would he now jeopardize the chance of preserving or even burnishing his legacy? Donald Trump is vowing, if elected, to unwind much of what Mr. Obama has accomplished. \u00a0\n\nTherefore, it is up to Congress to reauthorize the Independent Counsel Act to accomplish the same. It would direct the attorney general to petition the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to appoint one. No choice.\u00a0\n\nSadly, this may be the only way the public's trust can be restored.\n\n\n\nGregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 7, "mft_min": 1, "tone": -3.85109114646912, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1378, "FairnessVirtue": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.64418901314, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 43, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161103200000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 3.12046444121916, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/07/10-reasons-your-eyes-are-bloodshot.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [500, 513, 706, 719, 993, 1088, 2010, 2076, 2436, 3079, 3733, 3780, 3788, 3954, 4134, 4412, 4487, 4536, 4585, 5150, 5419, 5447, 5922, 6019, 6134, 6846, 6906, 7120, 7760, 7870, 8488, 8600, 8732]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1312, "scraper_regex": 1558}}, "headline": "10 reasons your eyes are bloodshot", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1558, "date": "20161207110000", "story_content": "Red eyes can spark a lot of annoying questions from people wondering if you're sick, upset, or hungover.\n\nBut bloodshot eyes can be caused by a bunch of different things. They're often a sign of another problem\u2014like dry eyes, too little sleep, or even overdoing it on certain eye drops, says Andrew Holzman, M.D., ophthalmologist and regional medical director of TLC Laser Eye Centers in Maryland.\n\n(For 2,000+ other tips on how to live your best life, check out the\u00a0Men's Health\u00a0Better Man Project.)\n\nHere are 10 possible culprits, and how you can fix them.\n\n#1. CAUSE OF RED EYES: YOUR EYES ARE DRY.\n\nWhen your eyes are dry, they become irritated and inflamed. It's that\u00a0inflammation\u00a0that causes the redness.\n\nDry eye is more common in adults over 50, but it often affects younger people who spend a lot of time staring at computer screens, says Dr. Holzman.\n\n\"We don't blink as much when we look at screens, which causes dryness,\" he says.\n\nOther symptoms:\u00a0Burning, stinging, and a gritty sort of feeling\u2014like something is in your eye.\n\nHow to fix it:\u00a0Artificial tears can moisten your eyes, which reduces inflammation and eases the redness.\n\nTo keep the problem from coming back, try to blink more when you're at your computer, says Dr. Holzman.\n\nYou can also try the 20-20-20 rule to help reset your blinks and reduce the dry-eye issues caused by staring at your computer: Every 20 minutes you're in front of a screen, focus on something 20 feet away from you for 20 seconds.\n\nIf that doesn't help, you could have chronic dry eye, so see your doctor.\n\nHe or she might prescribe eye drops that reduce dryness-related inflammation, like Restasis.\n\n#2: CAUSE OF RED EYES: YOU HAVE SEASONAL ALLERGIES.\n\nAllergens like pollen and grass can cause swelling and inflammation in your eyes, which can lead to redness.\n\nBecause allergies also tend to make your eyes itchy, you end up rubbing them, which creates even more inflammation and redness, Dr. Holzman says.\n\nOther symptoms:\u00a0Itchiness, sneezing, congestion, and watery eyes.\n\nHow to fix it:\u00a0Ease the redness and inflammation by applying cold compresses to your eyes for 15 minutes several times a day, says Dr. Holzman.\n\nThen, talk with your primary care doctor to figure out the best way to keep your allergies under control. He or she might recommend antihistamines, which decrease your body's response to allergens and ease inflammation.\n\nRelated:\u00a0How Your Allergy Meds Can Affect Your Gains At the Gym\n\nBut because antihistamines make your eyes dry, you might also have to use artificial tears to prevent dryness and redness.\n\n#3: CAUSE OF RED EYES: YOU'RE TAKING CERTAIN MEDS.\n\nAntihistamines aren't the only medications that can potentially dry out your eyes and leave them red.\n\nSleeping pills, anti-anxiety meds, and even pain relievers like ibuprofen can also cause dryness and redness.\n\nThese medications can reduce blood flow to tissue in and around your eye, making it dry and red, says Jeffrey Anshel, O.D., optometrist and founder of the Ocular Nutrition Society.\n\nHow to fix it:\u00a0Get quick relief from the dryness\u2014and redness\u2014with artificial tears.\n\nBut for longer-term relief, talk with the doctor who prescribed your medication. He or she may be able to adjust your dose, or offer an alternative prescription with fewer side effects.\n\n#4: CAUSE OF RED EYES: YOU HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP.\n\nWhether you stayed up late watching Netflix or spent half the night tossing and turning, your eyes will probably look a little bloodshot in the morning.\n\n\"The eyes need to be closed for an extended period of time for your tear layers to regenerate and replenish. And loss of tears leads to redness,\" says Dr. Anshel.\n\nOther symptoms:\u00a0You might find yourself squinting.\n\n\"The eyes'\u00a0muscles\u00a0need to recharge overnight,\" Dr. Anshel says.\n\nIf they don't get enough rest, you'll have a harder time focusing on things both close up and far off.\n\nHow to fix it:\u00a0Again, artificial tears can help you re-moisturize your parched tear layers, Dr. Anshel says. Getting the recommended 7 to 8 hours of sleep can keep the dryness from coming back. \u00a0\n\n#5. CAUSE OF RED EYES: YOU DRANK TOO MUCH.\n\nIt's not just the fact that you didn't get home until daybreak.\n\n\"Alcohol causes your blood vessels to relax,\" Dr. Holzman says. That allows more blood to flow through the vessels in your eyes, so they look redder.\n\nOther symptoms:\u00a0Headache, dehydration, nausea, and feeling like garbage overall.\n\nRelated:\u00a011 Ways to Cure a Nasty Hangover\n\nHow to fix it:\u00a0Use an over-the-counter eye whitening drop, like\u00a0Visine.\n\n\"It works by constricting blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to your eyes so they look less red,\" says Dr. Holzman.\n\nIt'll ease the redness within 15 minutes or so. Just don't go overboard (See #10.)\n\n#6. CAUSE OF RED EYES: YOU'RE A SMOKER, OR HUNG OUT WITH ONE.\n\nCigarette smoke causes the blood vessels in your eyes to constrict, which dries out the surface of your eyes, Dr. Anshel says.\n\nWhen your body senses the dryness and lack of blood flow, it tries to compensate by dilating your blood vessels. And that means more redness.\n\nOther symptoms:\u00a0You might notice dryness in the short term.\n\nIn the long-term, the blood vessel constricting-effects of smoking (or exposure to secondhand smoke) can raise your risk for macular degeneration and cataracts\u2014which can cause vision loss and even blindness.\n\nHow to fix it:\u00a0If you smoke, take steps to\u00a0quit smoking.\n\nIf not, seek fresh air. \"Your eyes should clear in about an hour,\" Dr. Anshel says.\n\n#7. CAUSE OF RED EYES: YOU HAVE PINK EYE.\n\nPink eye, or conjunctivitis, is a viral or bacterial infection that can strike in one or both eyes.\n\nIt's highly contagious, so it's easy to spread from one eye to the other by just rubbing your eyes, Dr. Holzman says.\n\nThe infection causes inflammation in and around your eye, which makes it look red and swollen.\n\nOther symptoms:\u00a0Itching or burning, watery eyes, mucus-like discharge, and sensitivity to light.\n\nHow to fix it:\u00a0See your eye doctor, who can examine your eyes to determine whether your pink eye is viral or bacterial.\n\nRelated:\u00a0Why You Should See Your Eye Doctor Regularly\u2014Even If You Think Your Vision Is Great\n\nIf it's viral, you'll probably have to wait it out, which can take two to three weeks. (Steroid eye drops could help the redness and swelling for really bad viral infections, Dr. Holzman says.)\n\nIf it's bacterial, your doctor will prescribe antibiotic eye drops, which will start soothing your symptoms within a couple of days.\n\n#8. CAUSE OF RED EYES: YOU JUST WENT SWIMMING.\n\nThe salt in ocean water is drying, which leads to redness.\n\nAnd pools contain caustic chemicals, like chlorine, that actually kill off some of the good bacteria in your eyes\u2014which can lead to irritation and redness, Dr. Anshel says.\n\nOther symptoms:\u00a0Your eyes might also feel dry or irritated.\n\nHow to fix it:\u00a0Flush your eyes with saline solution or artificial tears, which will wash out the irritating gunk and ease the redness, Dr. Anshel says. And if you wore contacts while swimming, take them out and clean them ASAP. \u00a0\n\nNext time, wear goggles to keep the salt and chemicals out of your eyes.\n\n#9. CAUSE OF RED EYES: YOU POPPED A BLOOD VESSEL.\n\nPopped blood vessels can happen if you were straining (like coughing intensely), if you slept in a weird position that put a lot of pressure on your eye, or experienced some kind of trauma\u2014like getting punched or being in a car accident.\n\nWhen a blood vessel bursts, blood gets trapped under the surface of your eye.\n\nThat can cause a bright red splotch, or make the entire white of your eye turn blood red.\n\nBut popped blood vessels aren't actually serious\u2014they just look bad, Dr. Holzman says.\n\nOther symptoms:\u00a0Popped blood vessels don't hurt, but your eye might feel slightly heavy from the extra blood.\n\nHow to fix it:\u00a0Unfortunately, there's nothing you can do to reduce the redness or speed up the healing.\n\n\"It should go away on its own in about a week,\" says Dr. Holzman.\n\n#10. CAUSE OF RED EYES: YOU WENT CRAZY WITH THE VISINE\n\nWeirdly, eye whitening drops can actually make your redness problem worse.\n\nThat's because the drops work by constricting the blood vessels in your eyes to reduce blood flow.\n\n\"If you use the drops on a regular basis, your body will adapt to the drops,\" Dr. Holzman says. \"Then when you stop, you end up getting a rebound effect where your blood vessels dilate and your eyes start to look red.\"\n\nRelated:\u00a0Gambling Addictions, Purple Sweat, Driving While Asleep\u2014the Scary Side Effects Of Popular Meds\n\nOther symptoms:\u00a0They'll vary, depending on the underlying issue that's making your eyes red (like drinking, smoking, or allergies).\n\nHow to fix it:\u00a0Using eye whitening drops once in a while (like after a night of drinking) is fine.\n\nBut if you're using them every day for more than a week or two, see your eye doctor to figure out what's actually causing your redness (often, it's dryness, Dr. Holzman says).\n\nOnce you figure out the root cause, you can treat it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MensHealth.com.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.79710149765015, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1312, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.04446593573, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 11, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.838414634146342, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/17/judge-napolitano-gross-mismanagement-our-nations-premier-law-enforcement-agency.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [6321]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 972, "scraper_regex": 1044}}, "headline": "Judge Napolitano: The gross mismanagement of our nation's premier law enforcement agency", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1044, "date": "20161117060000", "story_content": "When Hillary Clinton delivered a campaign post-mortem to her major supporters in a telephone conference call late last week, she blamed her loss in the presidential election on FBI Director James Comey. She should have blamed the loss on herself. Her refusal to safeguard state secrets while she was secretary of state and her failure to grasp the nationwide resentment toward government by the forgotten folks in the middle class were far likelier the cause of her defeat than was Comey.\n\nYet it is obvious that law enforcement-based decisions in the past four months were made with an eye on Election Day, and the officials who made them evaded the rule of law.\n\nHere is the back story.\n\nThe statutory obligation of the FBI is to gather evidence to aid in the prosecution or prevention of federal crimes or breaches of national security. The process of complying with this obligation necessarily involves making some legal judgments about the relevance, probity and even lawfulness of the gathered evidence. These judgments are sometimes made on the streets in an emergency and sometimes made after consultation and consensus. But the whole purpose of this evidence-gathering and decision-making is to present a package to the Department of Justice, for which the FBI works, for its determination about whether or not to seek a prosecution.\n\nIn cases in which subpoenas are needed, the FBI must work in tandem with the DOJ because subpoenas in criminal cases can be issued only by grand juries and only DOJ lawyers can ask grand juries to issue them. Usually, the FBI and the DOJ work together to present what they have to a grand jury in order to build a case for indictment or to induce a grand jury to issue subpoenas and help them gather more evidence.\n\nFederal judges become involved when search warrants or arrest warrants are needed. These are often emergent situations, as the evidence to be seized or the person to be arrested might be gone if not pursued in short order. They require the presentation of evidence to a judge quickly and in secret. It is the judge's role to decide whether the DOJ/FBI team has met the constitutional threshold of probable cause. Probable cause is met when the prosecutorial team shows the judge that the evidence the team seeks from the execution of the warrant more likely than not will implicate someone in criminal behavior.\n\nHaving issued many search and arrest warrants myself, I know that judges need to be curious and skeptical. After all, only one side is appearing before the judge, and the whole appearance is often quick, unorthodox and in secret. A healthy curiosity and skepticism will cause a prudent jurist to ask whether the grand jury really needs what the search warrant seeks. If the reply is that there is no grand jury, most judges will terminate the application and conclude that it is a fishing expedition -- or going \"sideways,\" as law enforcement says -- not a serious criminal investigation worthy of judicial involvement.\n\nAll of this is commanded by law to be kept secret so as to preserve evidence, avoid tipping off a potential defendant capable of flight and preserve the reputation of a person not indicted.\n\nThat is at least the way these things are supposed to work. Yet none of this happened in the recently reopened and re-terminated investigation of the misuse of emails containing state secrets by Clinton.\n\nIn that investigation, the DOJ did not present evidence to a grand jury. Thus, it did not obtain any subpoenas. And it did not seek any search warrants. It cut deals left and right, promising not to prosecute those from whom it sought problematic evidence. After accumulating a mountain of evidence of Clinton's guilt, the FBI did not present it to the DOJ.\n\nRather, Director Comey held a news conference on July 5, at which he declared that he and his colleagues in the FBI -- not the DOJ -- had concluded that \"no reasonable prosecutor\" would take the case; so Clinton would not be prosecuted. He then proceeded to outline in detail the gathered evidence against Clinton.\n\nHe endured a firestorm of criticism for his public presentation of the gravity of the evidence in the case and his unilateral determination of no prosecution. The firestorm was generated largely by his own FBI agents who had become convinced of Clinton's guilt of the failure to safeguard state secrets (espionage), as well as their collective belief that someone somewhere had told Comey what to do.\n\nThen, just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, Comey saw a chance to redeem himself with his critics. He unlawfully announced the unexpected discovery of a treasure-trove of 650,000 emails that he and his team had not then examined but that they thought might affect the decision not to prosecute. This caused a second firestorm, in which this writer and others accused Comey of profound violations of federal law, not the least of which was an assault on Clinton's right to due process.\n\nKnowing this announcement -- not the resumption of the investigation but the announcement of it -- was unlawful, Attorney General Loretta Lynch did nothing to prevent it.\n\nClinton began to sink in the polls. Her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, now the president-elect, began to gloat and celebrate. Then, two days before the election, Comey announced that the FBI had reviewed all 650,000 recently discovered emails in a week and concluded that none of them affected the decision not to prosecute Clinton. Shortly thereafter, a DOJ official announced that the email investigation was closed -- for a second time.\n\nWhat have we here?\n\nWe have the gross mismanagement of the nation's premier law enforcement agency. We have a DOJ uninterested in the truth and willing to shield a target of a criminal investigation for political reasons. We have the improper and unlawful revelation of matters the law quite properly commands be kept secret.\n\nWe have the dangerous injection of the FBI into elective politics, which can do ruinous harm to the rule of law.\n\nAnd we had a candidate who should blame only herself for the whole controversy.\n\n\n\nAndrew P.

Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong.\n\nCelebrex, or celecoxib, belongs to a class of NSAID called Cox-2 inhibitors that were designed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding common with many NSAIDs.\n\nThe primary goal of the 24,000-patient trial was to demonstrate that Celebrex did not cause an increased risk of serious heart problems compared with the other two drugs. The main measures of heart attack, stroke or death occurred between 2 percent and 3 percent of patients for all three medicines, a statistically significant result for non-inferiority.\n\n\"I think it's incontrovertible that celecoxib is not worse than these older NSAIDS,\" said Dr. Steven Nissen, the study's lead investigator.\n\nU.S. regulators ordered the study after pulling Merck & Co's blockbuster pain drug Vioxx from the market for causing heart attacks and deaths, leading many in the medical community to assume that the entire class of Cox-2 inhibitors was similarly tainted.\n\nMerck at one point offered the theory that naproxen, to which Vioxx was compared in studies, protected the heart.\n\n\"Everybody thought: 'Oh, naproxen is the safest; Celebrex is probably like Vioxx,'\" said Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American Heart Association's scientific meeting in New Orleans. \"Everybody thought they knew the answer, and the entire world was wrong.\"\n\nAnnual sales of Celebrex, which is now off patent, have declined to about $775 million for Pfizer. The drug is available as a generic from many companies, including Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\n\nCelebrex sales were about $3 billion in 2014 and could have been far higher but for safety concerns. In 2005, U.S. regulators ordered Pfizer to withdraw another Cox-2 pain drug, Bextra, over a host of safety issues and added a safety warning to the Celebrex label.\n\nNaproxen is the active ingredient in Bayer AG's Aleve, while ibuprofen is the main component of Pfizer's Advil.\n\nThe older drugs in the study were taken at higher doses and for far longer than the recommendations for the over-the-counter versions. Researchers stressed that safety issues seen in the study should not lead to conclusions about occasional use of the OTC products.\n\nCardiology researchers also said it was unclear how these results might affect prescribing habits of the primary care doctors who most often treat arthritis patients.\n\nPatients in the study took the drugs for 20 months on average and were followed for another 14 months. But 27 percent of those enrolled dropped out. Researchers said many chronic pain patients seek additional or alternative therapy.\n\nOn some secondary measures of the study, Celebrex actually fared better. Death for any reason was 25 percent higher with naproxen than Celebrex, although that did not quite reach statistical significance, while kidney problems were 64 percent higher with ibuprofen than Celebrex.\n\n\"I was completely surprised at the excess of renal toxicity with ibuprofen,\" Nissen said.\n\nThere was also a significant excess of gastrointestinal problems with ibuprofen and naproxen, such as severe anemia likely due to internal bleeding.\n\nDr. Elliott Antman, a past AHA president who critiqued the study, noted several limitations, including that those taking ibuprofen or naproxen were allowed to increase their dosage but not the Celebrex group. He called for a much more detailed analysis of the data.\n\nDr. Clyde Yancy, another past AHA president who also was not involved in the study, cited a need for better drugs.\n\n\"Clearly we need an additional therapeutic option for patients who have known cardiovascular disease and a chronic pain syndrome,\" he said. Available therapies have enough limitations \"that we're not where we need to be.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.77489757537842, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 646, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.62851496269, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114150000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.4055727554179596, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/23/mr-trump-now-that-youre-president-dont-leave-forgotten-americans-behind.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4857, 4923, 4956, 5089, 5115, 5130, 5149]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 760, "scraper_regex": 845}}, "headline": "Mr. Trump, now that you're president, don't leave the 'forgotten Americans' behind ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 845, "date": "20170123210000", "story_content": "Early last year, I wrote an oped for Fox News about the \"forgotten Americans\" and the fact that they were getting involved once again in the political process. \n\nThe term \"forgotten Americans,\" actually originated with late President Richard M. Nixon. Before he called them the \"silent majority,\" Nixon called them the forgotten Americans.\n\nWell, in 2016 the forgotten Americans stayed involved in the process and came out to vote in record numbers in Rust Belt states and in rural America. Because of them, America has its second true populist President since Andrew Jackson and the forgotten Americans have a commander in chief they can call their president.\n\nAfter the holidays, my wife and I were driving back to Washington, D.C., through rural Eastern North Carolina. \n\nWe went through town after town with closed up shops and stores. We saw homes and trailers in need of repair. We saw small businesses that looked like they were barely open, and we saw schools that were falling in. \n\nThere is something else, though, we saw along the way. We saw Trump sign after Trump sign in front of the little stores, trailers and homes that still showed the damage from Hurricane Matthew. \n\nEastern North Carolina is the place where Donald Trump received a huge \"over vote\" that propelled him to victory in North Carolina. It is also the place, like so many others in America, where the forgotten Americans live.\n\nAs we continued to drive through rural Eastern North Carolina and saw more homes and businesses still with Trump signs out front, my wife looked at me and said, \"He can't let these people down.\" \n\nMy wife is right. Besides keeping America safe, our new president's greatest priority must be to rebuild the economy in rural America and in our Rust Belt states. He must show them that we will have a new America that does not leave them behind.\n\nThe forgotten Americans love their families and want a better life for their kids. The forgotten Americans work hard \u2013 they weren't born on third base and thought they hit a triple. They worship their God and they go to church. They pay their taxes and obey the law. \n\nYes, the forgotten Americans love their country, but today they believe their government and its leaders have let them down. \n\nSomething is wrong and the forgotten Americans know it. They see the America they love slipping away and worry about their children's future in an America with less freedom and opportunity.\n\nThe forgotten Americans really aren't political, but in 2016 they got involved in the political process like never before. Many of them saw it as the last opportunity to save the America they once knew. \n\nFortunately, two of President Trump's most important and best appointments show that he understands the need to build the American economy in rural America and the Rust Belt and to give hope to the forgotten Americans of a better future and way of life for them and their families. \n\nMake no mistake, the appointments of Wilbur Ross to be Secretary of Commerce and Dr. Peter Navarro to be Director of the National Trade Council, are two of the Trump administration's best appointments. \n\nAsk anyone who knows them and you'll find that both of these men care about America's working class and understand the importance of creating real jobs for the American worker at the outset of the Trump Administration.\n\nFor years, Wilbur Ross has been known as a man who would go into economically depressed areas of America and buy distressed companies and even some in bankruptcy, and then turn them around to save and create thousands of American jobs. Not surprisingly, he often had the support of union workers. \n\nPeter Navarro is a noted economist, whose book \"Death by China\" shows a keen understanding of the real threat that China poses to the American economy and worker. A former U.S. Peace Corps worker, Navarro has a passion for helping people. \n\nPresident Trump could not have made two better appointments than Ross and Navarro for rebuilding the economy for the forgotten Americans.\n\nAs President Trump's \"Economic Team\" moves forward, they will hopefully be guided by the understanding that America doesn't need \"Wall Street Capitalism.\" \n\nWhat America needs, as so eloquently described and coined by economic strategist, David Smick, is \"Main Street Capitalism,\" that can create an economy and jobs for all the American people.\n\nThe forgotten Americans have given the Republican Party one more chance to get it right. \n\nThey have their president in Donald Trump. \n\nTrump and the Republican leadership must hear their voices and rebuild an America that will enable the forgotten Americans to provide for their families and build a better future.\n\n\n\nVan D.

The list includes such common chemicals as asbestos and trichloroethylene that have for decades been known to cause cancer, yet EPA lacked the legal authority necessary to ban their use.\n\nOver the next three years EPA will study whether the listed chemicals present an \"unreasonable risk to humans and the environment.\" The agency will then have another two years to mitigate that risk through new regulations, which could include banning the chemicals from use in the United States.\n\nOnce EPA completes its review of the initial 10 chemicals, studies will begin on dozens of other suspect chemicals. With tens of thousands of chemicals manufactured each year within the U.S. or imported from other countries, EPA is prioritizing those that are the most dangerous and widely used.\n\n\"Under the new law, we now have the power to require safety reviews of all chemicals in the marketplace,\" said Jim Jones, assistant administrator of EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. \"We can ensure the public that we will deliver on the promise to better protect public\u00a0health\u00a0and the environment.\"\n\nValued for its resistance to heat and corrosion, asbestos was widely used for decades in such products as building materials, pipe insulation and floor tiles before studies linked it to lung cancer and other diseases. EPA first tried to ban the use of asbestos in 1989, but its decision was struck down two years later by a federal appeals court that ruled the agency had exceeded its authority.\n\nThough most domestic manufacturers voluntarily stopped using asbestos in commercial products, it can sometimes still be found in imported products such as automotive brake pads.\n\nEPA's action comes less than two months before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, a frequent critic of EPA regulations that might negatively impact business profits. Overseeing Trump's transition team for the agency is Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank funded by corporate interests.\n\nThe institute runs a website that promotes the \"life-enhancing value of chemicals\" while sowing doubt about \"fear-mongering\" scientific studies that show risks to human\u00a0health\u00a0and the environment from pesticides and other products. Earlier this year, CEI issued an opinion article criticizing the expansion of EPA's authority to regulate toxic chemicals and questioning the need for an asbestos ban.\n\nEnvironmental and consumer safety advocacy groups on Tuesday praised the EPA's move, but also expressed concern about whether the incoming administration will embrace the process.\n\n\"Today's historic action by the EPA will finally begin the process of restricting the remaining sources of asbestos, which is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans,\" said Sonya Lunder of the Environmental Working Group Action Fund, which studies toxic substances. \"We expect the incoming Trump administration to uphold the EPA's commitment and honor the past, current and future victims of asbestos-triggered diseases.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.7168140411377, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 509, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.46630181205, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161129220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 4.12573673870334, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/24/trump-signs-orders-reviving-pipeline-projects-transcanada-says-it-will-reapply-for-keystone.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [394, 1225, 3847, 5261]}}, "headline": "Trump signs orders reviving pipeline projects, TransCanada says it will reapply for Keystone", "wordcount_as_scraped": 813, "date": "20170124230000", "story_content": "President Trump signed executive orders on Tuesday effectively reviving the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, as a major builder said it will reapply to build one of the projects which had been stalled by the Obama administration under pressure from environmental and other groups.\u00a0\n\nThe president said the projects would be subject to a \"renegotiation of the terms.\" But he made clear the government was resuming consideration for both pipelines, describing them as a potential boon to construction workers.\n\n\"We're going to put a lot of \u2026 steel workers back to work,\" Trump said. \"We'll build our own pipelines, we will build our own pipes.\"\n\nBuilder TransCanada said Tuesday afternoon it was \"preparing the application\" for the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\n\"We appreciate the President of the United States inviting us to re-apply for KXL,\" TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said in a statement.\n\n\"KXL creates thousands of well-paying construction jobs and would generate tens of millions of dollars in annual property taxes to counties along the route as well as more than $3 billion to the U.S. GDP,\" Cunha added.\u00a0\n\nAccording to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Trump directed agencies to approve it without delay -- and told agencies to expedite reviews and approvals for the remaining parts of the Dakota project.\n\n\"There's an energy revolution that's going to happen in this country,\" he said.\n\nThe president also signed three other orders related to pipeline construction, including one expediting the environmental permitting process for infrastructure projects and one directing the Commerce Department to maximize the use of U.S. steel.\n\nLooking ahead, Trump also announced he planned to nominate a justice for the Supreme Court next week, moving swiftly to try to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The president was summoning top senators to the White House later Tuesday to discuss his upcoming nomination.\n\nThe moves on the pipelines had been widely expected, as Trump last year blasted his predecessor for effectively blocking the projects.\n\nRepublican allies hailed Tuesday's orders, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying in a statement, \"It's about time.\"\n\nNorth Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer said: \"Today's executive orders affirm President Trump's respect for the rule of law and his support for responsible infrastructure development, energy production and job creation.\"\n\nFormer President Obama stopped the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in late 2015, declaring it would have undercut U.S. efforts to clinch a global climate change deal that was a centerpiece of his environmental legacy. The pipeline would run from Canada to Nebraska where it would connect to existing lines running to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. The U.S. government needs to approve the pipeline because it would cross the nation's northern border.\n\nSeparately, late last year, the Army Corps of Engineers declined to allow construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe, saying alternative routes needed to be considered. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters say the project threatens drinking water and Native American sites, though Energy Transfer Partners, the company that wants to build the pipeline, disputes that and says the pipeline will be safe.\n\nThe pipeline is to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. The project had been the subject of fierce protests until the Army Corps of Engineers stepped in.\n\nThe moves are likely to spark a new fight with environmentalists. Even before Trump's orders were official, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune put out a statement blasting what he called the \"dangerous\" decision. \u00a0\n\n\"The Keystone pipeline was rejected because it was not in the country's interest, and the environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline was ordered because of the threats it poses to the Standing Rock Sioux. Nothing has changed. These pipelines were a bad idea then and they're a bad idea now,\" he said.\n\nThe moves come as Trump makes the economy and jobs the centerpiece of his administration's first week in office.\n\nHe met Tuesday morning with representatives from the auto industry including GM and Ford, after meeting a day earlier, separately, with business and union leaders.\n\nThe pipelines were among the few issues that put the Obama administration at odds with labor unions, some of whom have voiced hope the Trump administration can work with them to promote job creation. Trump said Tuesday during his meeting with auto industry bosses that he considers himself an environmentalist, but called current regulations \"out of control.\"\n\nThe pipeline orders follow earlier executive actions covering everything from trade to ObamaCare.\n\nTrump on Monday signed measures withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and instituting a hiring freeze for most of the federal government. He also ordered federal agencies on his first day in office to ease the regulatory burden of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFox News' John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.11560693383216901, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 803, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.77245344023, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.23785803237858, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/14/family-fights-for-release-us-pastor-jailed-in-turkey-on-terrorism-charges.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1236, 2122, 2742, 2756, 3404, 3431, 3693, 3727, 4233]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 613, "scraper_regex": 662}}, "headline": "Family fights for release of US pastor jailed in Turkey on terrorism charges", "wordcount_as_scraped": 662, "date": "20161214170000", "story_content": "EXCLUSIVE: The family of a U.S pastor imprisoned in Turkey launched a campaign Wednesday for his release, saying the North Carolina native is being held on false terrorism-related charges and that his life is in danger.\n\nAndrew Brunson, 48, pastor of a Protestant church in Izmir, was locked up Friday after first being detained in October. The government accuses him of having ties to an American-based cleric, Fetullah Gulen, who Ankara blames for a July coup attempt.\n\n\"The government of Turkey -- led by an Islamic party -- has begun increased crackdowns on Christians, and Pastor Andrew, if convicted, may face years in prison based on extremely serious -- and false -- charges,\" said Jordan Sekulow, executive director of the American Center for Law and Justice, which is representing Brunson's family.\n\nBrunson and his wife, Norine -- originally from Black Mountain, N.C. -- have lived in Turkey for 23 years, running a Christian church with the full knowledge of local authorities, according to the ACLJ.\n\nOn Wednesday, after weeks of silence, the family called the charges against Brunson \"unfounded\" and \"shocking\" and demanded his immediate release.\u00a0\n\n\"Andrew's strong faith has always been at the center of his life and that has never been more evident than his pastorship in Turkey,\" his family said in a statement. \"His love and concern for the people of Turkey is unmistakable, as he has dedicated 23 years of his life serving them.\"\n\nBrunson was summoned to a local police station in Izmir on Oct. 7. According to the family, Brunson, a U.S. citizen, thought he would be receiving a long-awaited permanent residence card. Instead, Brunson was told he was being deported because he was a \"threat to national security.\"\n\nBrunson was arrested and fingerprinted while awaiting deportation. Officials confiscated personal items, including his phone, and denied him access to a Bible. They also prevented him from consulting an attorney and kept him in isolation for a period of time.\n\nBut Brunson's ordeal would soon take a dark turn. \u00a0\n\nOn Friday, after 63 days in captivity, Brunson was taken to a counter-terrorism center in Izmir. After further questioning, he was charged with \"membership in an armed terrorist organization,\" and a judge ordered he be imprisoned instead of deported.\n\nLawyers for the ACLJ told FoxNews.com Wednesday that the charging documents include no evidence to support claims the man broke any law. If convicted of such terrorism charges, Brunson could face years of imprisonment.\n\n\"We are launching a global campaign to call attention to his plight demanding that Turkey \u2013 a NATO member \u2013 release Pastor Andrew without delay,\"\u00a0Sekulow said.\u00a0\n\nThe family said the U.S. State Department as well as a member of Congress have been quietly negotiating his release over the last several weeks.\n\n\"We have seen reports of U.S. citizens in Turkey being detained and deported,\" a U.S. State Department official told FoxNews.com Tuesday, though the official did not mention Brunson by name, citing privacy concerns.\"\n\n\"The Department of State takes its obligation to assist U.S. citizens arrested abroad seriously. When a U.S. citizen is detained overseas, we seek to visit as soon as possible and to provide appropriate consular services,\" the official said.\n\nThe Brunsons, with help from the ACLJ,\u00a0launched a global campaign\u00a0Wednesday to raise awareness of the pastor's plight and pressure the U.S. government as well as the United Nations and NATO countries to act on his behalf. Turkey is a member of NATO. An online petition is also being circulated to help secure Brunson's release.\u00a0\n\nBrunson's 18-year-old daughter,\u00a0Jacqueline, who grew up in Turkey and attends college in North Carolina, called her father's imprisonment \"both troubling and disturbing.\"\n\n\"I grew up in Turkey and saw firsthand how much he loves Turkey and the Turkish people,\" Brunson said. \"He has exhibited nothing but love, mercy and grace during his time there.\"\n\n\"The best Christmas present our family could receive this year is the release of my father,\" she said.\n\nCristina Corbin is a FoxNews.com reporter.

They met in a living room used to receive residents just a few blocks away from the battle, some seeking help, others being questioned, while the unlucky ones faced interrogation or stern reprimands for various infractions. Ahmed asked his full name be withheld for fear of reprisals.\n\nWith heavy weapons less useful in the dense urban alleyways of Iraq's second city, local intelligence is growing in value. Special forces on the front lines are beefing up efforts to win civilians' trust, passing out food and medicine and gleaning real-time information about the extremists they are fighting in pitched, house-to-house combat.\n\nIn doing so, officers are also taking on classic counterinsurgency roles, becoming actors of local governance, addressing grievances and dispensing swift battlefield justice.\n\nThe offensive to free Mosul of IS militants is now in its second month, and progress has slowed as troops try to avoid mass civilian casualties that could give the impression the Shiite-heavy military was riding roughshod over the city's majority Sunnis.\n\nWhile tens of thousands of civilians have fled the fighting, over a million remain in their homes \u2014 some following official requests by the government to stay there, others preferring the risk of crossfire to spending the winter as an anonymous number in cold displacement camps.\n\nIn the Bakr neighborhood, parts of which are still contested, civilians lined the streets. Smiling children waved and greeted the troops, while younger men and elders watched convoys of Humvees pass with an air of skepticism.\n\nAutomatic rifle fire and heavy machine guns blasted all day from both sides, while mortars lobbed shells across neighborhoods, the city's relentless soundtrack. In the dusty wasteland to the east, a family pushed a relative's body on a cart back toward an aid station.\n\nPart of the intelligence gathering is rough \u2014 in the Samah neighborhood, soldiers arrested at least two suspected IS militants, wrapping T-shirts over their heads and beating them in the street as they dragged them off. Not every combatant shares the government's optimism that sectarian reconciliation can happen here. \"Why do you speak to them? They're all (IS),\" one soldier said of civilians leaving homes to visit relatives further from the crossfire.\n\nBut the softer approach, as advancing forces have learned countless times in modern warfare, can yield more value, and keeping civilians on one's side has become a major part of operations for Iraq's special forces, known officially as the Counter Terrorism Forces.\n\nSpeaking in the Bakr apartment, Lt. Col. Ali Hussein said his forces have strict orders to take care of civilians to win the peace, but that they went a bit further, buying medicine for the old and infirm.\n\n\"We pay with our own money, it's the humane thing to do,\" he said. \"It's a modest neighborhood and we have to keep a good reputation and show the civilians we are on the same side \u2014 Daesh has brainwashed them for two years,\" he said, using the Arabic acronym for the group.\n\nIS forces as well, driven underground and unable to group into formations for risk of attracting airstrikes, also realize the importance of information. On Friday alone, they sent three reconnaissance drones to scout positions in the district \u2014 the same amount as over the previous two weeks.\n\n\"It was a big push, much more than normal,\" Hussein said, showing off a damaged commercially available DJI Phantom 4 drone the size of a record player.\n\n\"We shot down two.\"\n\nFighting in built-up areas has slowed to a slog, as small numbers of IS snipers and suicide bombers in heavily-armored vehicles infiltrate neighborhoods to surprise troops and stunt advances. Battles play out on rooftops with IS forces holed up in buildings just a street or two away, with troops often jumping walls between houses to reach their positons.\n\nOn patrol, Iraqi forces here said that IS was now sending in two cars at a time packed with explosives. The first one destroys the giant sand barriers the army builds on side streets to create safe zones, and the second one races through the opened passage to attack troops. As a response, the special forces now line up parked civilian cars in front of the barriers.\n\nTroops also listen in on IS radio traffic, where they can sometimes hear the extremists directing suicide bombers who can't see through the heavy armor plating protecting their moving vehicles. Many of the dialects are foreign, including Gulf Arab and Egyptian.\n\nAs Hussein walked the streets with his troops, a man approached, beseeching the soldiers for help to protect his family on the IS-controlled side. After a brief stand-off, and the man lifting his shirt to show he wasn't wearing explosives, he became the latest informer.\n\n\"They are knocking down walls so they can move house to house, and they're approaching this line,\" said the man, who also asked that his name be withheld for fear of IS reprisals. \"They dig all night, we can hardly sleep.\" After sunset, IS was burning tires and homes to obscure night vision scopes used by the special forces.\n\nThe patrol went to the neighbors to confirm the story, lecturing the man for crossing over the front line via a rooftop but letting him go after locals vouched for him. Speaking with elders, Hussein told families to stay indoors and explained that cars must have their tires flattened or be considered a security risk.\n\nAnother man was scolded for trying to break into a house, claiming his uncle had sent him to secure belongings. Soldiers pushed him by the shirt collar to the area's de facto governor, who waved him off after some angry words.\n\n\"We cannot allow this,\" said Hussein. \"When civilians return they must not think that the special forces looted their homes.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Brian Rohan on Twitter at www.twitter.com/brian_rohan\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.2830524444580096, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1016, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.3105936413, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161127090000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 2.65748031496063, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/07/judge-refuses-to-release-4-accused-beating-disabled-youth.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [70]}}, "headline": "Judge refuses to release 4 accused of beating disabled youth", "wordcount_as_scraped": 758, "date": "20170108020000", "story_content": "CHICAGO \u2013 \u00a0A Chicago judge refused to allow four black people caught on cellphone footage taunting and beating a mentally disabled white man to post bail and leave jail, saying they are accused of such \"terrible actions\" that they are a danger to society.\n\n\"Where was your sense of decency?\" Cook County Circuit Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked them on Friday during their first court appearance, sounding baffled that the suspects could be charged with such cruelty toward the 18-year-old victim.\n\nThe beating was captured on cellphone video by one of the assailants and has since been viewed millions of times on social media. The graphic footage shows the suspects taunting the victim with profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nProsecutors offered new details of the assault, explaining that one of the suspects demanded $300 from the mother of the victim, who is schizophrenic and has attention-deficit disorder. They also said the beating started in a van when the same attacker became angry that the mother had contacted him asking that her son be allowed to come home.\n\nA prosecutor told the judge that the suspects forced the victim to drink toilet water, kiss the floor and then allegedly stuffed a sock into his mouth and taped it shut as they bound his hands with a belt.\n\nThe four are charged with two counts of committing a hate crime \u2014 one because of the victim's race and the other because of his mental disabilities.\n\nOn the video, the male suspects use knives to cut the victim's hair and his sweatshirt. One of the females can be seen laughing. A female also laughs as she punches the victim.\n\nOne of the men pulls the cord from the victim's sweatshirt around the victim's neck and holds him up while the victim groans in pain, according to a document read in court. The victim can be heard screaming when one of the men walks up to him with a knife and asks if he should \"shank\" him.\n\nAt one point, the prosecutor said, someone on the video can be heard saying that he did not care if the victim was schizophrenic.\n\nThe four suspects were identified as Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, both of Chicago, and Jordan Hill, of suburban Carpentersville. All are 18. A fourth suspect was identified as Covington's 24-year-old sister, Tanishia Covington, also of Chicago.\n\nThey stood quietly as the prosecutor read the allegations. Some of their relatives also listened, including a woman who wiped tears from her eyes.\n\nDefense attorneys portrayed the suspects as hardworking, responsible and religious. Cooper, for example, takes care of his twin brother, who is in a wheelchair. Tanishia Covington has two small children. Her sister attends college and has a job. Hill, the judge was told, goes to church with his grandmother.\n\nAll four have experienced brushes with the law, some for serious and violent crimes.\n\nHill, for example, was arrested as a juvenile in 2015 on allegations of armed robbery, possession of a stolen vehicle and residential burglary. Chicago police said they did not know the disposition of those arrests by suburban officers.\n\nTanishia Covington was arrested in 2007 on attempted armed robbery and aggravated battery charges. Police records do not show any convictions as a juvenile. As an adult, she was arrested on charges of battery and aggravated assault, but those charges were dropped.\n\nThe uproar over the beating intensified the glare on Chicago after a bloody year of violent crime and protests against Mayor Rahm Emanuel and a police department that has been accused of using excessive force and hushing-up wrongdoing. The department has also been the subject of a long civil-rights investigation by the Justice Department, which is expected to report its findings soon.\n\nThe incident also stirred emotions still raw after a presidential campaign that split the nation. Some conservatives suggested it was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement. Police said there was no indication of any connection.\n\nThe incident began New Year's Eve, when the victim and alleged assailant Jordan Hill met at a suburban McDonald's, and then called his parents later to say he was staying with Hill for a sleepover.\n\nInstead, Hill drove the victim around in a stolen van for a couple of days, ending up at a home in Chicago, where two of the other suspects lived, police said.\n\nThe victim's parents reported him missing Monday evening, two days after last hearing from him. The victim eventually escaped and a police officer spotted him wandering down a street, bloodied and disoriented.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -12.3595504760742, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 742, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.2575405213, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170108020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.63881401617251, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/17/wave-ethnic-killings-engulfs-town-in-south-sudan.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [70, 5631, 5641]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1101, "scraper_regex": 1196}}, "headline": "Wave of ethnic killings engulfs town in South Sudan", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1196, "date": "20161117210000", "story_content": "YEI, South Sudan \u2013 \u00a0Infants hacked with machetes. Charred bodies with their arms bound. Women who were gang-raped. Men who were spared death but arbitrarily detained.\n\nThese are the tales of horror told in Yei, a formerly peaceful town surrounded by farms in southern South Sudan near its border with Uganda and Congo.\n\nOnce a beacon of coexistence, Yei is now a center of the country's renewed civil war, gripped by a wave of killings among South Sudan's dozens of different ethnic groups.\n\nAnd things could get worse.\n\n\"The signs are all there for the spread of this ethnic hatred and targeting of civilians that could evolve into genocide, if something is not done now to stop it,\" said Adama Dieng, the U.N.'s Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, after visiting Yei last week.\n\nCivilians and local government officials in Yei told The Associated Press of army troops and, to a lesser extent, the rebels terrorizing the population and killing people based on their ethnicity.\n\n\"Some leaders will not hide their (loyalty) to their ethnic groups. They cannot hide it. Genocide is not an event that one day comes. It builds and it builds up. The indicators are there,\" said Jacob Aligo, a minister in the Yei state government.\n\nAt night, gunshots echo through the town and soldiers prowl the streets, looting and raping, according to more than a dozen residents and government officials interviewed by the AP.\n\nA woman who identified herself only by her first name of Betty for fear of reprisal said government soldiers knocked on her door one night in mid-October.\n\n\"My husband pushed me and my two children under the bed and he opened the door. They demanded money, and he had none, and then they shot my husband,\" she recalled, saying he bled to death. She said she later visited a friend who had been gang-raped by armed men.\n\nWhen civil war spread across South Sudan in December 2013 \u2014 more than two years after the country gained its independence from Sudan \u2014 the town of Yei was spared the violence that arose elsewhere.\n\nThe civil war, which killed tens of thousands and displaced more than 2 million people, grew out of a political split between President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Rick Machar. The conflict often pitted Kiir's Dinka tribe against Machar's Nuer community and other minority groups.\n\nYei became a refuge for all of the country's 64 tribes who wanted to avoid the fighting, and crime was almost nonexistent, residents said. The surrounding area produced food for the entire country and a nearby coffee plantation received support from actor and longtime South Sudan activist George Clooney.\n\nWhen a peace deal was signed in 2015, it seemed that Yei had avoided bloodshed.\n\nBut last summer, after fresh fighting erupted in South Sudan's capital, Juba, between Kiir's army and the rebels under Machar, the renewed civil war came to Yei.\n\nCivilians in Yei began to suffer in August when the army came in to fight nearby rebels, said Gista, a resident who also refused to give her last name out of fear for her safety.\n\nShe said government soldiers swarmed a village on Yei's outskirts, where her daughter and son-in-law lived. He apparently didn't hear the soldiers coming, and \"when he tried to run, the killers were already there,\" Gista said. They killed him and her daughter, as well as her 4-year-old granddaughter, and hacked a 4-month-old granddaughter with a machete, she said. The infant survived after being hospitalized, she added.\n\nThe military, which residents and local government officials say are from the Dinka tribe, attacked other tribes who are natives of Yei and surrounding Equatoria state on suspicion they supported the rebels, the locals said.\n\nA militia called Mathiang Anyoor, which is allied to Kiir and Army Chief of Staff Paul Malong and is Dinka, also terrorized civilians, according to residents, local officials and U.N. officials.\n\nResidents are restricted from moving 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the center of town in all but one direction. Surrounding areas have been declared off limits by the military. When the AP traveled in a government convoy in those \"no-go\" areas, they were deserted, with fields lying fallow and empty houses and shops boarded up.\n\nSanto Domic Chol, a spokesman for the South Sudan army, or SPLA, said the allegations of soldiers targeting civilians were \"baseless,\" and part of a propaganda campaign influenced by the rebels.\n\nIn early November, 11 people traveling from Yei were rounded up by unidentified individuals, placed in a thatched hut, and burned alive, local government officials said. Their charred corpses were still there in mid-November when AP counted seven bodies, some with their arms bound behind their backs.\n\n\"We are living in crazy times,\" said Athanasio Yongule, minister for Local Government and Law Enforcement. Like other local officials, Yongule said South Sudan's army does not answer to them.\n\nSince July, hate speech has been on the rise in the region on social media, according to Stephen Ladu, the acting governor of Yei River State.\n\n\"We can see that the boys in the bushes will be writing on the social media that they will come and attack this community,\" Ladu said.\n\nLetters sent to humanitarian groups and seen by the AP have threatened to kill civilians from Equatoria state who live elsewhere in South Sudan. Ladu and other local officials want U.N. to send peacekeepers to Yei to protect civilians.\n\nNearly 150,000 people have fled to Uganda from the Yei region since July, and 120,000 have moved elsewhere in South Sudan, according to\u00a0estimates\u00a0from the South Sudan Protection Cluster.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency said in September that about 100,000 people are \"trapped\" in Yei by \"military operations,\" and it is distributing items like soap and blankets.\n\nMany civilians are gripped by hunger in a region that once was South Sudan's breadbasket. About 40 percent of the area's population faces food insecurity, according to internal U.N. estimates obtained by the AP.\n\nBecause of the conflict, they don't have access to their farms, said Richard Ruati an assistant external relations officer for U.N. refugee agency in Yei.\n\n\"Sometimes when they go to their farms, they are either accused by the government soldiers of harboring the rebels or the rebels and the armed groups accuse them of harboring government soldiers,\" he said.\n\nCivilians \"are bearing the brunt of both sides, and they don't know where to turn to,\" he said.\n\nDieng, the U.N. adviser on genocide, painted a harrowing picture of his visit to Yei as he left South Sudan last week, recounting stories of \"targeted killings, assault, maiming, mutilation, rape, and the barbarous use of machetes to hack families to death.\" He said: \"Yei is one urgent example among many.\"\n\nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued a stark warning about South Sudan this week.\n\n\"There is a very real risk of mass atrocities being committed in South Sudan, in particular following the sharp rise in hate speech and ethnic incitement in recent weeks,\" Ban said in a report to the Security Council. But he added that U.N. peacekeeping operations don't have the \"appropriate reach, manpower or capabilities to stop mass atrocities.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 8, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.8218297958374, "HarmVice": 16, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1101, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.90403780337, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161117210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6330608537693, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/16/free-speech-clash-justices-considering-offensive-trademarks.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [73]}}, "headline": "Free speech clash: Justices considering offensive trademarks", "wordcount_as_scraped": 766, "date": "20170116090000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0The Slants aren't exactly a household name when it comes to music, but the Asian-American rock band has certainly made its mark in the legal world.\n\nThe Oregon-based group has spent years locked in a First Amendment battle with the government, which refuses to register a trademark for the band's name because it's considered offensive to Asians.\n\nThat fight will play out Wednesday in the nation's highest court as the justices consider whether a law barring disparaging trademarks violates the band's free-speech rights.\n\nThe case has drawn attention because it could affect the Washington Redskins in a similar fight to keep the National Football League team's lucrative trademark protection. The government canceled the team's trademarks last year after finding they are disparaging to Native Americans.\n\nFor Slants founder Simon Tam, the name was chosen not to offend, but to take on stereotypes about Asian culture. He says the band is reclaiming a term once used as an insult and transforming it into a statement of cultural pride.\n\n\"Words aren't equipped with venomous impact on their own,\" he said in an interview.\" They have to be tied to motive and rooted in context.\"\n\nBut the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office didn't see it that way. It refused to register the name in 2011, saying a trademark can be disparaging even if it's meant to be used in a positive light.\n\nA divided federal appeals court handed the band a victory four years later, ruling that the law prohibiting offensive trademarks is unconstitutional.\n\n\"Whatever our personal feelings about the mark at issue here, or other disparaging marks, the First Amendment forbids government regulators to deny registration because they find the speech likely to offend others,\" Judge Kimberly Moore said for the majority.\n\nThe Obama administration has urged the Supreme Court to overturn that ruling. In legal briefs, the Justice Department argues that the law does not restrict speech, but declines to associate the federal government with \"racial epithets, religious insults and profanity as trademarks.\"\n\nIf the decision is upheld, the government warns it will be forced \"to register, publish and transmit to foreign countries marks containing crude references to women based on parts of their anatomy; the most repellent racial slurs and white supremacist slogans; and demeaning illustrations of the prophet Mohammed and other religious figures.\"\n\nYet the trademark office has approved plenty of crude and offensive trademarks in the past. Those include: Afro Saxons and Dago Swagg clothing, Baked By A Negro bakery products, Retardipedia and Celebretards entertainment services, and the hip-hop band N.W.A., an acronym that includes a racial slur against African-Americans.\n\n\"If their intent is to curtail hate speech, it's not working,\" Tam says. \"Trademark registration is not the mechanism to address those types of things.\"\n\nThe government is relying in part on a 2015 ruling in which the Supreme Court said the state of Texas could ban specialty license plates bearing the Confederate battle flag. The high court ruled 5-4 that the ban was allowed since state-issued license plates were a form of government speech.\n\nBut Megan Carpenter, a professor at Texas A&M University School of Law specializing in intellectual property law, said the Texas case may not extend to trademarks.\n\n\"The trademark office has said time and again that issuance of a trademark registration is not an endorsement of the underlying content,\" Carpenter said.\n\nThe Washington Redskins had hoped to piggyback on the Slants case and have the Supreme Court hear their dispute at the same time \u2014 even before the case finishes working its way through lower courts. But the justices declined to take up the unusual request and a Virginia federal appeals court has put the Redskins case on hold pending the outcome of the Slants case.\n\nA loss of the team's trademark would strip the Redskins of certain legal protections, but would not force it to change the name. The Redskins have said their name honors Native Americans, but the team has faced years of legal challenges from groups that say it's a racial slur.\n\nSeveral American Indian groups that oppose the use of the Redskins name filed a brief in the Slants case calling the adoption of \"racial names\" by sports teams \"an especially derogatory trademark that warrants regulation.\"\n\nAs for the Slants, the band just released a new song called \"From the Heart\" about the upcoming case. Tam says it's \"like an open letter to the trademark office saying we're not going to give up, we're going to continue fighting for what's ours.\"\n\nThe song is on the band's latest album \"The Band Who Must Not Be Named.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.273504257202149, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 751, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 10, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.37956914463, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170116090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.66045272969374, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/16/woman-charged-in-adopted-daughters-death-fostered-30-kids.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [73]}}, "headline": "Woman charged in adopted daughter's death fostered 30 kids", "wordcount_as_scraped": 689, "date": "20170116050000", "story_content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2013 \u00a0A woman charged along with her boyfriend in the rape, murder and dismemberment of her adopted 14-year-old daughter took in 30 foster kids before her then-husband was deemed a sexual predator.\n\nFormer adoption worker Sara Packer and her ex-husband fostered the children from 2000 to 2010, when they led a transient life in northeast Pennsylvania, state officials confirmed on Friday. The state's Department of Human Services said it was reviewing the family's history leading up to the torture death of adopted daughter Grace Packer.\n\nSara Packer and her boyfriend, Jacob Sullivan, are charged with killing Grace in their Bucks County home before Packer reported her missing in July. Grace's body was found in a wooded area upstate in October, and the couple were charged with murder on Sunday after a joint suicide attempt.\n\nPacker and Sullivan are being held without bail until a preliminary hearing set for next week. Neither has a lawyer listed in court records. But Sullivan apologized as he was led into court, the Intelligencer newspaper reported.\n\n\"I'm sorry for what I did,\" Sullivan said. \"It was wrong.\"\n\nPacker's ex-husband, David Packer, was convicted in 2011 of raping a foster teen and molesting Grace between 2006 and 2010, when the family lived in Allentown.\n\nThe foster teen, who was learning disabled, initially told police David Packer had had sex with her when she was 18 and Sara Parker knew about it, authorities said.\n\n\"As reprehensible as that may be, it isn't a crime,\" said Lehigh County District Attorney James Martin, whose office prosecuted the case.\n\nHowever, the teen ultimately disclosed the sex had begun when she was 15. David Packer went to prison for about five years on statutory rape and indecent assault charges.\n\nSara Packer was barred from taking in more foster children and lost her $44,000-a-year job as a Northampton County adoption supervisor over unspecified misconduct. But she kept her two adopted children: Grace and her biological younger brother. And there would have been no child welfare checks unless a new complaint was filed, since adoptive parents have the same rights as other parents, Martin said.\n\n\"Grace, who was subsequently raped and murdered, was an adopted child. That adoption was already a fait accompli,\" he said. \"It's a horrific story, but I don't know what else my office or the Allentown Police Department could have done at the time.\"\n\nWithin a few years, Sara Packer and the two children were living with Sullivan, a draftsman, in Glenside, in Montgomery County. In the fall of 2015, they sent Grace to live with a relative in North Carolina, where she spent several happy months, prosecutors said. When she returned home, the couple started plotting her death, a police affidavit says.\n\nSara Packer watched as Sullivan raped Grace on July 8 and then went out to buy Tylenol PM used to sedate Grace before they left her to die, bound and gagged, in a sweltering attic, the affidavit said. When they found her still alive the next day, Sullivan strangled her, police said.\n\nThey packed her body in cat litter and hid it in the house for several months before they cut it up with a saw and dumped it in the woods, police said.\n\nThe Packers had adopted Grace and her brother when she was 3, after a Berks County judge removed them from a home where they had been sexually abused by adults living with their parents. The Department of Human Services has opened a six-month review of the Packer family that will include checks on the welfare of the 30 former foster children, authorities said.\n\n\"If there is a systemic review that comes out of this horrible tragedy, at least we can take some solace in that ... so children like Grace are not forgotten, so they don't fall through the cracks,\" said Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub, whose office is leading the murder investigation.\n\nCourt records show the Packers divorced last June. David Packer's lawyer from a 2010 case said this week he couldn't comment. A man who answered the phone at Sara Packer's father's home declined to comment and hung up.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.21768712997437, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 671, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.6181361349300003, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170116050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.2786885245901605, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/12/can-chemotherapy-drug-turn-back-clock-in-women-s-ovaries.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1193]}}, "headline": "Can chemotherapy drug \u2018turn back the clock\u2019 in women\u2019s ovaries?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 690, "date": "20161212160000", "story_content": "It's generally thought that women are born with a finite number of egg cells, and cannot grow new ones.

And understanding exactly how this happens could aid in the development of fertility treatments that allow women to produce more eggs, the researchers said.\n\nHowever, the researchers caution that the study was small, and the findings do not prove that the chemotherapy treatment caused the production of new eggs. In addition, it's not clear whether the greater number of eggs seen in these women after the chemotherapy treatment would help with their fertility.

Typically, one follicle matures each month, and releases an egg. As women age, the number of follicles in their ovaries declines, which reduces their chances of pregnancy .\n\nSome cancer treatments accelerate the loss of follicles, and thus hurt a women's fertility. But other cancer treatments don't seem to have an effect on fertility.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers originally set out to examine why a common chemotherapy treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma (a cancer of white blood cells) doesn't appear to affect fertility. The treatment is a combination of four chemotherapy drugs \u2014 adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine \u2014 or ABVD for short.\n\nThe researchers analyzed samples of ovarian tissue donated by 8 women who had undergone ABVD, 3 women who had undergone a different type of chemotherapy and 12 healthy women around the same age.\n\nWomen who received the ABVD treatment had a much greater number of immature follicles in their ovaries \u2014up to 10 times higher in some cases \u2014 than healthy women and those who'd received the other chemotherapy, the study found. Women who'd received ABVD also had a much greater number of follicles than would be expected based on their age.\n\nThe follicles in ABVD group also appeared younger \u2014 similar to those seen in girls before they go through puberty.\n\nWhen the researchers tried to grow the follicle in a lab dish, those from the ABVD group didn't grow as well as those from the other two groups - only about 20 percent of follicles from the ABVD group showed growth, compared to 42 to 46 percent in the other two groups, the study found. This limited follicle development is also comparable to what's seen in prepubescent girls, the researchers said.\n\nThe researchers speculate that the ABVD treatment may active stem cells within the ovary to produce new eggs.\n\n\"It could be that the harshness of the treatment triggers some kind of shock effect or perturbation which stimulates the stem cells into producing new eggs,\" Telfer told the Telegraph .\n\nBut there could be other explanations, including that the egg follicles were damaged during treatment and split into two or more parts, David Albertini, laboratory director at the Center for Human Reproduction in New York, told the Guardian .\n\nFuture studies will examine the effect of each of the four chemotherapy drugs separately, to better understand the mechanism that may be leading to an increased number of follicles, the researchers said.\n\nThe study was published online Dec. 5 in the journal Human Reproduction.\n\nOriginal article on Live Science.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.3550136089324998, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 676, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 0.9875254992, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 6, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161212160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.887573964497041, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.545454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/19/worst-worst-blocked-obama-from-keeping-promise-to-close-gitmo.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2654]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 714, "scraper_regex": 771}}, "headline": "'Worst of the worst' blocked Obama from keeping promise to close Gitmo", "wordcount_as_scraped": 771, "date": "20170119220000", "story_content": "President Obama's famous pledge to close the Pentagon's Guantanamo Bay detention facility was ultimately done in by the very evil of the men it houses.\n\nWhile hundreds of enemy combatants and terror suspects have been through the facility since the war on terror began - with many returning to the fight - the most hardcore Al Qaeda operatives ever captured remain there. They are too dangerous to set free, and no one else wants them.\n\n\nDuring its peak, Gitmo held some 778 suspected Al Qaeda operatives. Obama acclerated the policy of his predecessor, President Bush, to free those deemed to no longer be a risk. Within the last week, another 14 were released from the facility, and turned over to other countries willing to hold them.\n\nBut the federal government admits that once they leave Gitmo, there's no guarantee their new countries will keep them locked up. And the Pentagon has estimated that at least 30 percent returned to the battlefield, killing Americans and their allies.\n\n\"The policy of closing Guantanamo Bay has made America less safe,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. \"The best way to gather intelligence long term to help prevent Islamic terror attacks is by capturing those engaged in Islamic terror groups and questioning them over a long period of time.\"\n\nThe Trump administration will reverse Obama's policy and keep Gitmo open, Johnson predicted.\n\n\"As long as the war on terror continues, as long as Islamic terrorists want to attack the civilized world including the U.S. and U.S. interests, we ought to try to find them, and where we can, capture them and question them,\" Johnson said. \"I don't know why we would handcuff ourselves and not have a detention facility.\"\n\nDuring the terms of President Bush, who opened Gitmo after 9/11, the prisoner count swelled to 779. It had dropped to 242 when Obama took office, and now stands at 41.\n\nStill at Gitmo for more than a decade are some of the \"worst of the worst,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe most famous - and most dangerous - occupant is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Pakistani senior Al Qaeda \"recruiter, financer and operational planner\" who the Pentagon calls the \"mastermind\" of the 9-11 attacks. The 52-year-old terrorist also was indicted for his role in the Feb. 26, 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.\n\nRetired Army Maj. Gen. Jay Hood, who oversaw the detention facility, and who has personally interviewed many of the terrorists there, said clearly Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other top Al Qaeda operatives \"should never leave.\" \u00a0\n\nAlso remaining at Gitmo:\n\nAbd al Aziz Ali, 40, a citizen of Pakistan and an Al Qaeda senior member and planner. His military records show that under the direction of his uncle, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, he helped plan 9/11 and was involved in numerous other plots against the US.\n\nAbd al Rahim al Nashiri, 52, a citizen of Saudi Arabia, is considered \"one of Al Qaeda's most skilled, capable and prolific operational coordinators.\" With a long jihadist history, he and has been linked to as many as a dozen plots to attack U.S. and western interests including the successful bombing of the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen on Oct. 12, 2000. He reported directed to Usama bin Laden, according to the U.S. military.\n\nAbd al Hadi al Iraqi, 56, a citizen of Iraq, is a senior member of Al Qaeda, according to the U.S. military, which determined that in addition to serving as an accountant and commander for the terror network, al Iraqi also initiated attacks on coalition forces in Afghanistan.\n\nMustafa Ahmed al Hawsawi, 48, a citizen of Saudi Arabia, is a senior Al Qaeda member who served as a \"facilitator, financial manager and media committee member\" his records show. He is accused of planning the movement of 9-11 hijackers and helping to obtain financing for the terror plot.\n\nRamzi Bin al Shibh, a citizen of Yemen, is a senior Al Qaeda operative who, according to his military file, was the \"coordinator\" of the 9-11 attacks.\n\nWalid Bin Attash, a citizen of Yemen, is a senior Al Qaeda operative who served as a trusted bodyguard for Bin Laden. His military file said the 38-year-old helped coordinate and acquire materials for the USS Cole bombing.\n\nAfter reviewing the background of many of those still at Gitmo, Hood said it is \"obvious why other countries around the world do not want to take them off our hands.\"\n\n\n\nMalia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

But one thing he does know is how to get angry, white men to vote for him.\"\n\nThank you former President Bill Clinton for the endorsement of my book, \"Angry White Male.\" After his wife Hillary's devastating loss, I guess Bill had a lot of spare time on his hands for book reading.\u00a0\n\nBravo Mr. Clinton. You finally got it right. It took you a while. First you blamed the FBI for your wife's defeat. Then Russia. Then the electoral college. But you've finally come to the right conclusion. It was in fact your Democrat Party's inability to appeal to angry white males that cost your wife the election.\n\nYes, angry white males won it for President-elect Donald J. Trump. Trump won white males by 32 points nationwide (63% to 31%).\u00a0\n\nBut Trump didn't just win white males. He won a resounding victory among white people of all kinds.\u00a0Trump beat Clinton among white women 53 percent to 43 percent. Among white voters without a college degree, Trump beat Clinton by a remarkable 72 percent to 23 percent. Trump won among white, non-college women 62 to 34 percent and white college-educated men, 54 to 39 percent. Income didn't even matter either- Trump beat Clinton among white people of all income ranges.\u00a0\n\nYet Bill Clinton just revealed that Democrats learned\u00a0nothing\u00a0from their defeat.\u00a0\n\nClinton's comment about \"angry white males\" sounded bitter and derogatory. Just more disrespect from a leading Democrat. Unlike my book which spoke on behalf of white males and explained why we're angry, Clinton was clearly insulting white males.\u00a0\n\nClinton was insinuating Trump is a dumb white male with no talents, except for getting other white males to vote for him. More sour grapes and vitriol from one of the leaders of a bitter, defeated political party.\n\nBut think for a minute about what this kind of thinking really represents.\n\nFirst, Clinton's comments were racist. Can you even imagine if I said, \"Barack Obama doesn't know much, except how to get angry black people to vote for him.\" Every Democrat and civil rights leader in the country would denounce me as a \"racist.\" Bill Clinton sees white men as dumb and angry for no reason. He thinks they voted for Trump just because Trump is a man and white. How insulting. How racist.\n\nI'm a white male and I voted for Donald Trump because the policies of Obama and Hillary have wrecked the U.S. economy, killed middle class jobs, skyrocketed the price of healthcare, made it almost impossible to start or run a business, and they've spent our country into unimaginable debt and bankruptcy.\n\nSecondly, Democrats should be asking\u00a0WHY\u00a0did so many white males and white people abandon the Democrat Party. Instead of making fun of us\u2026or insulting us\u2026or writing us off like we don't matter\u2026maybe Democrats should try to figure out why we're angry and craft an agenda that appeals to us, resonates with us, provides solutions to our problems.\n\nMaybe Democrats should come to the realization that if tens of millions of members of one group are angry, maybe there's actually a legitimate reason.\n\nThe truth is the Democrat Party offers not a single reason for any angry white male to vote for them. There's not a single thing you offer to someone who works for a living. There's not a single thing you offer to someone who pays taxes into the system. There's not a single thing you offer to someone who desires no handouts from government. There's not a single thing you offer to someone who pays for their own health insurance out of their own pocket.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Mr. Clinton, angry white males are angry at the Democrat Party for good reason. Your party left us a long time ago. You wrote us off. You left us for dead. You made us feel invisible. You made us feel like villains, for working hard, for earning an honest living, for achieving prosperity, for paying taxes, for asking for nothing from government.\n\nYes, we're angry. Yes, we voted for Donald Trump. This is called \u00a0payback.\u00a0\n\nBut the good news is, we're not angry anymore.\u00a0With President Donald J. Trump in charge, we feel vindicated. The future looks bright. We're going to make America great again- for\u00a0people of all races, religions and genders.\u00a0\n\nSo, from now on, please refer to us as...\n\nHAPPY WHITE MALES.\n\n\n\nWayne Allyn Root is a capitalist evangelist, serial entrepreneur, conservative national media commentator, and proud champion of the middle class.

Various government bodies and private organizations chip in to offer material, psychological and medical support to the survivors, still scarred by the horrors they experienced 70 years ago. But all agree that the greatest burden late in their lives is loneliness.\n\n\"It's not pleasant to be alone,\" Weiner said in his apartment south of Tel Aviv. \"It gives a good feeling\" to have people visit.\n\nSome 160,000 elderly survivors remain in Israel, with a similar number worldwide. In Israel, about half receive special government stipends, but a third still live under the poverty line, well above the national 20 percent poverty rate.\n\nThat's where the nonprofit sector gets involved. The Association for Immediate Help for Holocaust Survivors was established nine years ago for the purpose of aiding survivors anywhere in Israel, at a moment's notice. Run solely on donations, it currently has some 8,000 volunteers around the country.\n\nThey help survivors with everything from legal assistance to paying their bills, buying their groceries to driving them to doctor appointments. Several times a year, they throw parties that become a highlight on survivors' calendars.\n\nThe care continues even after death. The association's modest office currently houses a number of orphaned dogs and cats left behind by their owners.\n\n\"Morally, not just as Jews but as people of the world, we must help them finish their life in dignity without them having to beg for warm food,\" said Tamara More, the association's voluntary CEO. \"These are people whose lives were robbed from them because of the world's silence, and we all have an obligation to give them something back in the little time they have left.\"\n\nSix million Jews were killed by German Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust, wiping out a third of world Jewry. Israel's main Holocaust memorial day is in the spring \u2014 marking the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising \u2014 while the United Nations designated Jan. 27 as International Holocaust Remembrance Day, commemorating the date of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp in 1945.\n\nAs the senior adviser to former Finance Minister Yair Lapid, Naama Schultz spearheaded the ministry's efforts to boost previously paltry funding to those who survived camps and ghettos. Besides a monthly stipend, the state also provides expanded health care, free medication and discounts on various living expenses.\n\nBut Schultz said money couldn't address their emotional needs. Many survivors kept their pasts to themselves for decades, often alienating even the people closest to them due to their trauma. Only in their final years are many finally ready to open up, and often then there is no one around.\n\n\"There is always more you can give them, but what they really want most is someone to just be with them,\" she said.\n\nPlenty of organizations try to answer that need by matching soldiers and students with survivors. One highly publicized initiative offered university students rent-free accommodations in return for living with lonely survivors and keeping them company.\n\nNoga Rotman, a 32-year-old computer science student, said she decided to get involved several years ago when her grandfather, a Holocaust survivor, became ill.\n\n\"I couldn't help but think about those who didn't have that,\" she said, amid the balloons and flowers at Weiner's party, which was attended by dozens who were inspired to come by a Facebook post. \"Anytime we have something like this, you just see how much it means to them.\"\n\nWeiner said he especially appreciated the company of youngsters. As for fellow survivors, he had mixed feelings.\n\n\"On the one hand, it feels good to have all these people. On the other hand it reminds you of such tough times,\" he said. \"Happy it can't be, because it was not happy times, but it is nice to have someone listen.\"\n\nWhen the Nazis invaded his native Austria, Weiner and his sister fled to Holland while their parents stayed behind and died of illness. The rest of the family perished.\n\nAfter the Nazis occupied Holland, they were placed in the Westerbork transit camp, from where his sister was sent to her death in Auschwitz.\n\nThanks to his work as an electrician, Weiner got to know the camp well and estimates he escaped deportation about 15 times, once after he was placed on a train for Auschwitz. But the harsh conditions took their toll. In the course of his work, he got so many electric shocks that it caused heart damage, and an accident blinded his right eye. Diabetes later deprived him of sight in his left eye and confined him to a wheelchair.\n\nNow that his wife is gone, Weiner has a caregiver who stays with him and another who visits daily. But the volunteers who arrive several times a week provide most of the conversation.\n\nAt the party, children handed him drawings. Soldiers and scouts gave gifts, and there was even a surprise visit from Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli \u2014 who heard Weiner was a fan and stopped by to snap some pictures with him.\n\nBut the most moving moment was when a Dutch-speaking volunteer whom he has grown close to leaned in to let him know she was there. He teared up, and then she did too.\n\n\"The fact that he is glad, that brings me joy,\" said Liel Van Aalderink, 22. \"I don't do really much extraordinary. I just give him attention and talk to him because he is alone in the world.\"\n\n____\n\nFollow Heller on Twitter at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap .\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.754005670547485, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 952, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.06105164523, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.6806722689075602, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/04/dana-perino-lets-do-this-millennials-here-are-your-top-5-mentoring-tips-for-2017.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [340, 1014, 1196, 1197, 2929, 3450, 4921]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1252, "scraper_regex": 1387}}, "headline": "Dana Perino: Let's do this, Millennials! Here are your top 5 mentoring tips for 2017", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1387, "date": "20170105000000", "story_content": "We dropped the ball at midnight on New Year's Day. The moment was merry and joyful. We even danced (terribly).\n\nI didn't enjoy the moment for long, because my anxiety about my \"to do lists\" never retreats . . . I worry more about forgetting to do something\u00a0than just about anything else.\n\nI have to stay ahead of my anxiety to keep all of the balls in the air. This year, I resolved to embrace the new technology available that can help prevent me from spacing on an appointment or to complete a task (at least once a month I have a dream that despite all my best efforts I show up late to The Five and miss the show. Greg Gutfeld wishes that it would actually happen!).\n\nJust as I try to find ways to be more productive every year for myself, I also look for tips to pass on to young professionals. Here are my top five for 2017.\n\nCome on, millennials \u2013 this is your year. Let's do this!\n\nDana's Five Mentoring Tips for 2017\n\n1. \u00a0Perfect your Poker Face:\n\nYou can tell a lot about a person just by watching their facial expressions. But there are times when it's best to hide your feelings, especially at work. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere's an example: Once when my aide and I were traveling on business, we had to spend the day in a car that smelled strongly of smoke (the driver was a heavy smoker). It was bad \u2013 and too cold and rainy to put the windows down without being completely obvious about our discomfort. We didn't want to be rude.\n\nYou could read how my aide felt about the situation. It made an awkward situation even more uncomfortable - she looked like he was going to suffocate! I had to hold back laughter, but then I realized we were at risk of offending the driver. I felt awful, and so did she when I brought it up afterwards. Lesson of the day? Keep a smile on your face and deal with it in order to keep the day on a positive note. And remember to request a non-smoking car when you book!\n\nThere's another reason for this, especially if you're in management or leading a team. If you are trying to get people to work on a problem together, it's best if they don't know where you as the supervisor/manager stand on the question. I learned that from former Vice President Dick Cheney. He said it is best to keep your thoughts to yourself, maybe ask some questions to help drive the discussion, but not freeze out a healthy debate if the staff thinks they need to be on the side of the boss. Because the boss needs to hear all sides and she may change her mind to agree with you, too.\n\n2. Resist Up-Talking & Apologizing\n\nMany young adults I have communicated with \u2013 both in-person and over email \u2013 constantly apologize before stating their idea, or finish each sentence with a question. Unfortunately, doing so in business puts you at an immediate disadvantage with your boss and work colleagues. Here are some ways to fix this bad habit:\n\nA.\u00a0Stop ending your sentences with a question (Sorry if you think I'm a broken record on this...but it is so important): \"Up-talking\" is a common way millennials communicate with peers, but it reduces credibility in the workplace. Instead of talking in that high pitch voice that gets higher at the end of a sentence (like THIS!), find your strong voice. Speak slowly, and deeply from your diaphragm. Think before you speak. And never question what you are saying while you are saying it \u2013 have confidence in your idea!\n\nB.\u00a0Remove the words \"just\" and \"that\" from your emails: By removing these two words from your email lingo, your correspondence will become more direct and assertive as a result. It's an easy fix, but difficult to implement.\n\nC. Stop apologizing to your boss for doing your job: Often, younger professionals offer an apology when they present something to their boss such as, \"Sorry if this article is not what you want \u2013 I can easily re-do it.\"\n\nIf you apologize when you send an email or present your product, it immediately sheds doubt on your work before your boss has even seen it. It also comes across as insecure \u2013 not a trait you want to portray in the workplace.\n\nBe confident in what you do and take pride in it! No more apologizing for doing your job.\n\n3. Make Posture a Priority \u2013 Seriously.\n\nI'm becoming a nag about this. Young adults are going to have neck and upper back problems as a result of constantly leaning down to look at their phones. Good posture is not just professional, it is also important for the health of the rest of your body and muscles. Trust me, I have experience with this from my days at the White House -- my back has never quite been the same. Good posture simply must be a priority. Period.\n\nThe best way to correct posture is through exercise and good practice of holding yourself properly. But lucky for you, I have a secret weapon: posture correctors! This is an inexpensive tool you can order online that I wear on every flight \u00a0- there are all different styles and brands. Mine easily fits into my bag, so I take it everywhere.\n\nTraveling is a good opportunity to correct your posture for an hour or two. When I'm wearing the corrector on a flight, the few people who've asked me about it have been road warriors who realize their lifestyles are contributing to their bad posture - it's happening all around us.\n\nI promise you will thank me in five years (or ten\u2026) - correct your posture while you still can.\n\n4. Leave Your Home Office\n\nIn the age where working remotely from home has increasingly become the norm for many adults, and where \"the office\" is now centered around your mobile phone instead of a physical building, there are costs as well as benefits to employees.\n\nManagers should require these \"remote employees\" to attend at least one networking event per month. The reasons are simple and more important than you may realize.\n\nThe more time we spend alone, the more we get comfortable with it. Networking is a muscle - it needs to be worked. Don't be left without any support from colleagues and friends - make a point to expand your work/friend circle. You will notice a positive difference in your workweek right away. It's important for career growth, job satisfaction, and personal fulfillment.\n\nThe way to combat this in 2017 is simple: Sign-up for a young professionals group, an art class, or hit up a local seminar or event that sounds interesting to you. Get out there and meet some people.\n\n5. Stretch & Save Your Dollar:\n\nAre you sick of being told you need to have more money in your savings account? Too bad. Because you do.\n\nWhen it comes to money, millennials have some of the highest student loan debt rates of any generation in history. The average millennial has roughly $30,000 in student loans. That's like trying to run a marathon wearing thirty-pound ankle weights.\n\nA recent survey finds that 40 percent of millennials don't have a retirement savings account at all (46 percent of women and 33 percent of men), and 73 percent don't know their net worth.\n\nAmerica's largest generation in the workforce cannot afford to gamble their retirement. Time to make saving a priority and take control of your finances. As difficult as it may be, it is absolutely crucial. Take it from a Gen X'er.\n\nWhatever you need to do, whether meeting with a financial advisor, using mint.com to manage your spending, or utilizing technology and mobile banking to control your debt and savings, make it happen this year. Your savings cannot wait until tomorrow; start now.\n\n\n\nDana Perino currently serves as co-host of FOX News Channel's \"The Five\" (weekdays 5-6PM/ET).

We don't want people to be caught with nothing.\"\n\nEnding ObamaCare without a substitute plan could result in as many as 20 million Americans losing their health insurance, which would be political disaster for Republicans.\n\nObama exited his 90-minute, closed-door meeting without comment but reportedly urged fellow Democrats not to \"rescue\" Republicans on what he suggested be called \"Trumpcare.\"\u00a0\n\nNew Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said afterward that Obama and fellow Democrats had a \"very inspiring\" meeting in which they discussed a strategy to save ObamaCare, then blasted Republicans for their repeal-replace agenda.\n\n\"It would make America sick again, lead to chaos instead of affordable care,\" the New York Democrat said. \"They have no idea what to put in place of [ObamaCare]. They talked about repeal, but for five years they have nothing to put in its place.\"\n\nThe visits come on the second day of the new, GOP-led Congress.\n\nTrump replacing Obama at the White House in 16 days puts the GOP's longtime goal of annulling much of the 2010 health care overhaul within reach.\u00a0\n\nTrump, despite his campaign vows to repeal the law, warned his colleagues on Wednesday not to let Democrats off the hook for a program he called a \"disaster,\" while warning them to be careful in their methods.\n\nThose who voted for Trump and other ObamaCare detractors are already concerned about congressional Republican leaders saying after the election that they'll need two to four years to implement a replacement plan. \u00a0\n\nObamaCare was created as a way to drive down overall insurance costs by reducing emergency-care visits and other uninsured medical expenses.\n\nHowever, lower-than-projected enrollment among younger, healthy Americans as well as doctors and insurance companies dropping out of the program have contributed to significantly increasing premium costs.\n\nOn Tuesday, as the 115th Congress opened, Senate Republicans took the first step toward repealing ObamaCare.\n\nSen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., introduced a resolution that begins the process for repeal legislation and calls for two House and two Senate committees to send over a legislative plan by Jan. 27.\n\n\"Today, we take the first steps to repair the nation's broken health care system,\" said Enzi, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nHe and other leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress are relying on a parliamentary maneuver known as \"budget reconciliation\" to dismantle the law because it avoids a Senate Democrat filibuster and requires only a 51-vote majority for passage in the chamber, not the 60-vote majority.\n\nRepublicans have a 52-to-48 member majority in the Senate and a 241-to-194 majority in the House, which requires only a simple majority for passage.\n\nTrump has provided few specifics about how he would revamp the nation's $3 trillion-a-year health care system. Steps he and congressional Republicans have mentioned include greater reliance on tax credits to help people afford coverage.\n\nAnd he has talked about keeping such provisions as allowing young adults to stay on their parents' plan and providing access to coverage for Americans with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.346820801496506, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 767, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.04111104925, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.04172099087353, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/15/new-york-womans-cross-country-grattitude-project-honors-late-mother.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [6096]}}, "headline": "New York woman's cross-country 'GrAttitude Project' honors late mother", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1063, "date": "20161215150000", "story_content": "In mid-December 2012, Mary Latham sat in her midtown Manhattan office scrolling through the horrifying headlines telling of an armed suspect shooting 20 innocent children and six staff members at a Connecticut elementary school. Latham, who had been working at a law institute during the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary, was worried about how she would explain the senseless killings to the 6-year-old she regularly babysat.\n\nA coworker who swung by her desk and told her about a man who was buying free coffee for strangers at a local Starbucks offered respite, and a routine phone call with her mother, Pat, further helped soothe her.\n\n\"She told me there's always going to be these terrible things that happen, and we have to focus on the guy that got them coffee this morning,\" Latham, now 29, recalled to FoxNews.com.\n\nLatham is still grieving the death of her mother, who lost a battle with recurrent breast cancer at age 61 in 2013. But Latham, a professional photographer, is honoring her message through the GrAttitude Project, a nationwide effort in which she is driving across the country, bunking with strangers, and collecting stories of good deeds for her website. The project takes a similar approach to that of the viral Facebook series \"Humans of New York,\" and is an extension of a short-lived Facebook campaign that Latham and a friend began after her mother's death.\n\nExchanging positive stories in her mother's hospital room helped Latham's family cope, and Latham plans to compile the anecdotes she gathers on her road trip for a book she will distribute to hospitals across the nation.\n\n\"[A hospital] is such a depressing place, and having something like that around would give people hope,\" Latham said.\n\nLatham is making her way across the country in her mom's 2008 Subaru Outback, starting last fall in New England, and raises awareness of her mission through local media and coffee shops where she hands out information pamphlets. She has launched a campaign on GoFundMe.com to help cover costs for gas and food. Although she plans to fly home to Orient, Long Island, for a couple of weddings next year, she does not have a timeline or deadline for the project.\n\n\"I just want to meet as many people as I can,\" said Latham, who has traveled to Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine and New Hampshire so far.\n\nMarianne Morgan, the first stranger Latham stayed with, in Westerly Rhode Island, saw a Sunday article in the area's local paper and reached out to offer Latham a bed for the night of Nov. 4.\n\n\"Negative news seems to catch more people's interest than positive news,\" Morgan told FoxNews.com. \"[Latham's] feeling of spreading hope and that people really are so nice and so kind, but you just hear about the bad ones\u2014 I loved the message, and I wanted to promote that by helping her in any way we could.\"\n\nThe two shared bottles of Angry Orchard apple cider and ate slices of pizza while watching the TV show \"This Is Us,\" and although a stranger, Latham seemed to Morgan like an old friend. The story she offered Latham involved how a wrong email address led her to begin a long-distance friendship with a former stranger she continues to email. In fact, the experience led Morgan to open her home to Latham in the first place.\n\nMorgan said she thinks people don't talk face to face enough, which prevents many stories from being shared and connections from being made.\n\n\"I've found that anywhere in the world that I've gone, if you listen to people, they're more than happy to give you advice or help you\u2014 it's just to let them in that is the biggest hurdle,\" Morgan said.\n\nNot all of the folks Latham has met have opened up immediately. She tells subjects they don't have to share their stories, but has found that after a few minutes of talking, people begin to feel ease.\n\nLatham recalled a story of a Connecticut mom of three whom she met toward the beginning of her trip. The woman described how she spent four months living in a hospital at her husband's bedside as he battled cancer.\n\n\"She was able to meet up and talk to me about how great the nurses had been,\" Latham recalled, \"and she has three young daughters, and I swung by to get a picture of them, and [she] gave me a journal and bag of apples.\n\n\"It's been really overwhelming how cool everyone's been and how excited people are,\" Latham added. \"I think that it is making it very clear that this was really needed.\"\n\nFor Latham, traveling the country with her camera and a trunk full of custom T-shirts that read \"more good\" is continuing to help her cope with the loss of her mother.\n\nOn Christmas Day, she is staying with Kim Roche, of Mansfield, Massachusetts, who saw a friend post about the GrAttitude Project on Facebook and got in touch with Latham to offer her a bed.\n\nSimilar to Morgan, Roche had never hosted a stranger before, but she supports Latham's effort to spread more good.\n\n\"Obviously, there's a lot going in the world that is so negative \u2026 people are grabbed by it more,\" Roche told FoxNews.com. \"You don't see as many of the positive stories, and I'd hope everybody has experienced someone doing something nice, whether it's the person buying your coffee in the morning, or during tough times when people are there for you.\n\n\"Mary is taking such a leap everywhere she goes that how can we not take one for her?\" she added.\n\nLike Latham, Roche, a mother of two 9-year-old twin boys, has lost a parent to cancer.\n\n\"Anybody that loses somebody they love, at the holidays it's different from that point on, and it's something that we still struggle with,\" Roche said.\n\nLatham described her mother as \"a bright light in my life\" who \"made me see the good in people and situations, and to be a good person and optimistic, no matter what.\"\n\n\"For me to do this trip is such a big undertaking, and there will be moments that are discouraging,\" Latham said, \"but think it's important for me to do it, and to do it alone, and try to make this really beautiful thing\u2014 a book that people can read and be uplifted for her.\"\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.909842848777771, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1022, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 7, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.28784387637, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.2504892367906097, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/01/05/dr-manny-cyber-warfare-isnt-just-political-issue-its-medical-concern-too.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3959]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 636, "scraper_regex": 687}}, "headline": "Dr. Manny: Cyber warfare isn't just a political issue; it's a medical concern, too", "wordcount_as_scraped": 687, "date": "20170105190000", "story_content": "If you haven't been paying attention to the reports on the alleged cyberattacks launched by Russia and other foreign nations, it's time you tuned in. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman told lawmakers at a hearing on Thursday that \"every American should be alarmed\" by Russia's alleged attack on our 2016 presidential election, and I'm telling you that as a patient, you should be, too.\n\nCyber warfare is real, the technology is complicated and in the case of patient care it can be deadly. One of the most important takeaways from Thursday's testimony, in my opinion, is that the U.S. is a step behind many others in this dangerous game. As a physician who is involved with administrative regulations, I know how computers and the federal mandates to move patient information and data to electronic records could prove to be a great danger to the American patient, even though technology is a useful tool in health care.\n\nBefore you accuse me of using fear-mongering tactics, consider the multitude of hacking that goes on in the private sector. Simply providing your credit card information to a website, or having it stored on your mobile device leaves you vulnerable to identity theft and in danger of having your financial or personal assets stolen.\n\nIf you don't understand why health care would be a targeted area for cyber warfare, consider that the industry alone accounts for 17.8 percent of our nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). I can tell you confidently that despite its value, the industry remains one of the most vulnerable areas for an attack. Not only are our hospitals unable to identify a possible attack, but they are also extremely ill-prepared to prevent one from happening.\n\nThe first, most obvious implication of this is that every patient's record contains extensive detail of personal information\u2014from social security numbers to financial information and even family history. You could see how a hack at just one, small hospital or medical center could potentially put thousands of Americans in danger.\n\nThe second implication is a danger that was addressed on the Hill today, in which a hacker uses stolen data to create unrealistic scenarios. In the medical world, you have to consider a scenario in which the hacker penetrates medical records of patients admitted to the hospital. Having access to this population's medical records could mean that with a click of a button, vital information regarding diagnosis, medication allergies, blood pressure levels, intravenous dosage schedules and the like could be erased, or altered, without anyone even knowing what happened.\n\nIf it sounds to you like this is a science fiction movie, I've got news for you \u2013 a version of it has already been made a reality. A July report found the health care industry has been hit harder by ransomware than any other industry, with approximately 88 percent of attacks targeting hospitals. That report listed twelve examples, and here are just a few: In Texas, Titus Regional Medical Center was prevented from accessing computer files. In February, hackers shut down the IT systems of Hollywood (Calif. Presbyterian Medical Center). In Kentucky, Methodist Hospital declared an internal state of emergency after a virus limited its use of electronic web-based services.\n\nThere are more examples, including a heart hospital in Kansas that was forced to pay ransom in order to get their computer files unlocked, but I think I've made my point. This is a major, identifiable headache that we need to get ahead of before our patients are put in further danger. Hospitals and medical centers must put budgetary emphasis on cybersecurity in order to maintain patient safety. If a foreign country is able to hack into our electric grid and threaten a major blackout, imagine the damage they could inflict on one of major medical centers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor.

To Kurdish military intelligence officials, the cause of the congestion was clear.\n\n\"I haven't seen anything like this. They are running away massively,\" a Kurdish military intelligence source told FoxNews.com, even as he spoke by phone to an ISIS informant traversing the distant road.\n\n\"Ten minutes ago, the airstrikes hit a bomb factory in Bulayj,\" the official repeated. \"ISIS fighters came to\u00a0Bulayj and arrested all the tribal sheiks and accused them of spying. Families are both willingly and being forced to go to Raqqa.\"\n\nISIS loyalists and victims alike appear to be using every means possible to flee, making the trip in pickup trucks, tractor-trailers and small vehicles.\n\nWhen the exodus was still a trickle earlier in the week, ISIS sought to hide the escape route by burning tires along the roadside. But as FoxNews.com watched, only the dust from dirt roads provided scant cover in the distance as the convoys chugged westward.\n\nThe terror army's escape now depends on a different sort of cover.\n\n\"ISIS often has many different things they do to block vision,\" another Peshmerga officer said. \"But even so, we can't attack them [when they are] loading cars with kids and women. How could we attack kids? They have no part in this fight.\"\n\nSimilarly, the U.S.-led coalition won't unleash airpower with civilians in harm's way, giving ISIS -- and likely its leadership -- free passage to its Syrian base.\n\n\"ISIS is moving more and more of its families to Raqqa, they are kicking civilians out of their homes and occupying them,\" one source connected to Iraqi Forces intelligence explained. \"Then, only the men return to Mosul to keep fighting.\"\n\nAccording to multiple insiders familiar with the Mosul-to-Raqqa route and ISIS tactics, the group takes abandoned roads and moves through friendly, Sunni-populated villages that provide not only cover, but potential safe haven.\n\nThe journey is typically completed in three legs, first going from Mosul to the Syrian and ISIS-controlled city of Abukamal, with one more stop in the town of Shadiya before the journey to Raqqa is completed. Another route stretches from Mosul to the Iraqi ISIS stronghold of Tel Afar, then along dirt tracks to the border town of Ba'aj before Raqqa.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Kurdish officials predict the path will only get busier as ISIS prepares to surrender Mosul and retrenches in its last bastion. Pentagon officials have made clear that a move on Raqqa could quickly follow a successful operation in Mosul, where Kurds, Iraqi military, Shia militias and U.S. advisers are pushing inward to retake a city ISIS overran more than two years ago. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said last week the move to free the Syrian stronghold could commence in a matter \"of weeks.\"\n\nWith Raqqa poised to be the bloodiest battle yet, U.S commanders have expressed concern that it may not be enough to effectively do the job.\n\n\"The U.S. will maintain an advice-and-assist role, and provide air support,\" a Pentagon spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve, the name given to the anti-ISIS mission, told FoxNews.com.\n\nActivists from Raqqa told FoxNews.com that ISIS is bolstering checkpoints throughout the city, searching houses, rooting out suspected spies and sending a renewed wave of fear through the embattled city.\n\n\"ISIS is afraid -- arresting people every day, raiding Internet cafes,\" noted his colleague Tim Ramadan, a nom de guerre for the Raqqa native and activist who fled the fighting and now works documenting Assad regime and extremist atrocities.\n\nISIS is also spreading fear about the Iranian-backed Shia militias, which are sworn enemies not only of ISIS, but also all Sunni Muslims and U.S. troops as well. Derisively dubbed \"the popular crowd,\" the militias are so vicious and volatile that the Iraqi government forbade them from entering Mosul out of fear they would commit atrocities.\n\n\"ISIS is telling the people that 'the popular crowd' is coming to fight you, not just us,\" Ramadan said.\n\nExperts say the U.S. will have to follow through to help instill stability if and when Mosul and Raqqa fall and ISIS is vanquished.

Bowe Bergdahl's request for a pardon, while the soldier's lawyers work on a backup plan to have their client's charges dismissed after President-elect Donald Trump takes office.\n\nBergdahl is the former prisoner of war accused of endangering comrades by walking off his post in 2009 in Afghanistan.\n\nBergdahl's original pardon request was apparently sent Friday to President Obama through the Justice Department, and the secretary of the Army received a copy. But it was not formally requested through the military chain of command, Fox News learned.\n\nIf Obama grants the clemency request before leaving in January, Bergdahl could avert a military trial scheduled for this spring, when he will face charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.\n\nThe misbehavior charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.\n\nHowever, if the pardon isn't granted, Bergdahl's defense team plans to expand its legal strategy by filing a motion arguing Trump violated its client's due process rights with scathing public comments about the case.\n\nBergdahl, of Hailey, Idaho, was held captive by the Taliban and its allies for five years after walking off his post.\n\nThe Obama administration's decided in May 2014 to exchange him for five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prompted criticism that included some Republicans accusing Obama of jeopardizing nation's safety.\n\nSome lawmakers were outraged that the administration didn't give Congress a 30-day notice about transferring the detainees, as required by law.\n\nShortly after Bergdahl was returned to U.S. custody, President Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, said he served his country with \"honor and distinction.\"\n\nThroughout his presidential campaign, Trump criticized Bergdahl, saying repeatedly the soldier is a traitor who would have been executed in the \"old days.\"\n\nDuring a July speech in Indiana, Trump lamented that Bergdahl could wind up with a light punishment.\n\n\"Remember the old days?

The latter pointedly declined to deport the 5 million undocumented immigrants in the United States who are the parents of children born here -- children who, by virtue of birth, are American citizens. Trump has made known his intention to deport all undocumented people, irrespective of family relationships, starting with those who have committed crimes.\n\nIn response to Trump's stated intentions, many cities -- including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco -- have offered sanctuary to those whose presence has been jeopardized by the president-elect's plan. Can they do this?\n\nHere is the back story.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the president is the chief federal law enforcement officer in the land. Though the president's job is to enforce all federal laws, as a practical matter, the federal government lacks the resources to do that. As well, the president is vested with what is known as prosecutorial discretion. That enables him to place priority on the enforcement of certain federal laws and put the enforcement of others on the back burner.\n\nOver time -- and with more than 4,000 criminal laws in the United States Code -- Congress and the courts have simply deferred to the president and permitted him to enforce what he wants and not enforce what he doesn't want. Until now.\n\nEarlier this year, two federal courts enjoined President Obama -- and the Supreme Court, in a tie vote, declined to interfere with those injunctions -- from establishing a formal program whereby undocumented people who are the parents of natural-born citizens may lawfully remain here. It is one thing, the courts ruled, for the president to prioritize federal law enforcement; it is quite another for him to attempt to rewrite the laws and put them at odds with what Congress has written. It is one thing for the president, for humanitarian reasons or because of a lack of resources, to look the other way in the face of unenforced federal law. It is another for him to claim that by doing so, he may constitutionally change federal law.\n\nTrump brilliantly seized upon this -- and the electorate's general below-the-radar-screen disenchantment with it -- during his successful presidential campaign by promising to deport all 13 million undocumented immigrants currently in the United States, though he later reduced that promise so as to cover only the 2 million among them who have been convicted in the United States of violating state or federal laws.\n\nEnter the sanctuary cities. These are places where there are large immigrant populations, among which many are undocumented, yet where there is apparently not a little public sentiment and local governmental support for sheltering the undocumented from federal reach. Trump has argued that these cities are required to comply with federal law by actively assisting the feds -- or at least not aggressively resisting them.\n\nThus the question: Are state and local governments required to help the feds enforce federal law? In a word: No.\n\nThe term \"sanctuary cities\" is not a legal term, but it has been applied by those in government and the media to describe municipalities that offer expanded social services to the undocumented and decline to help the feds find them -- including the case of Chicago's offering undocumented immigrants money for legal fees to resist federal deportation. As unwise as these expenditures may be by cities that are essentially bankrupt and rely on federal largesse in order to remain in the black, they are not unlawful. Cities and towns are free to expand the availability of social services however they please, taking into account the local political climate.\n\nEnter the Supreme Court. It has required the states -- and thus the municipalities in them -- to make social services available to everyone resident within them, irrespective of citizenry or lawful or unlawful immigration status. This is so because the constitutional command to the states of equal protection applies to all persons, not just to citizens. So the states and municipalities may not deny basic social services to anyone based on nationality or immigration status.\n\nThe high court has also prohibited the federal government from \"commandeering\" the states by forcing them to work for the feds at their own expense by actively enforcing federal law. As Ronald Reagan reminded us in his first inaugural address, the states formed the federal government, not the other way around. They did so by ceding 16 discrete powers to the federal government and retaining to themselves all powers not ceded.\n\nIf this constitutional truism were not recognized or enforced by the courts, the federal government could effectively eradicate the sovereignty of the states or even bankrupt them by forcing them to spend their tax dollars enforcing federal law or paying for federal programs.\n\nThus the Trump dilemma. He must follow the Constitution, or the courts will enjoin him as they have his predecessor. He cannot use a stick to bend the governments of sanctuary cities to his will, but he can use a carrot. He can ask Congress for legislative grants of funds to cities conditioned upon their compliance with certain federal immigration laws.\n\nAll of this is part of our constitutional republic. By dividing powers between the feds and the states -- and by separating federal powers among the president, Congress and the courts -- our system intentionally makes the exercise of governmental power cumbersome by diffusing it. And since government is essentially the negation of freedom, the diffusion of governmental powers helps to maximize personal liberty.\n\n\n\nAndrew P.

Among the maneuvers to be dropped starting next year are amphibious landing exercises and beach raids aimed at enhancing the country's territorial defense, military officials said.\n\nDuterte's actions have become a hindrance to U.S. efforts to reassert its presence in Asia, although the U.S. military has vowed to continue patrolling one of the world's busiest commercial waterways.\n\nAfter Duterte met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in October, China allowed Filipinos to fish at disputed Scarborough Shoal.

The exchanges were suspended in 2012 when the Philippines brought its territorial disputes with China to international arbitration under Aquino's presidency, angering Beijing, he said.\n\nChina has also inquired if it can supply armaments to the Philippines, he said.\n\nChina can further expand its influence in the region if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump pursues an isolationist foreign policy, former Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said.\n\n\"If the U.S. relinquishes (its) leadership posture in terms of the region, that vacuum will be quickly filled by our northern neighbor,\" del Rosario said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.354058742523191, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 542, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.8624393618639999, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4760147601476001, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2017/01/30/airlines-airports-maintain-normal-operations-amid-nationwide-protests.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [217, 251, 425, 1265, 3290, 4308, 4504]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 621, "scraper_regex": 680}}, "headline": "Airlines, airports maintain normal operations amid nationwide protests", "wordcount_as_scraped": 680, "date": "20170130180000", "story_content": "Airports around the country say operations have mostly resumed to normal after a series of protests erupted in response to President Donald Trump's\u00a0executive order blocking visitors\u00a0from seven predominantly Muslim nations.\n\nAccording to Skift, U.S. carriers did not receive advance notice of the order or information from the government on how to address \u00a0passport and visa holders from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen\u2014even those who are lawful U.S. citizens.\n\nDespite the immigration confusion, several airport officials confirmed to Fox News Monday that most protests have disbanded and fliers should proceed with travel as booked.\n\nAirports\n\nDespite the dramatic protests that made headlines over the weekend, many airport officials say there were few, if any, reports of travel delays and, by Monday morning activity at arrival and departure terminals was proceeding without incident throughout the country.\n\nPROTESTORS JAM THE PHONE LINES AT TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RESORT\n\nSan Francisco International Airport spokesman Doug Yakel said that as of Monday, there were no reports of passengers missing flights, all security checkpoints were open and there are no delayed flights.\u00a0\n\nAt Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), congested lanes brought traffic to a halt on the airport ramps, reportedly causing a few people to miss flights on Sunday.

But as the fallout from his recent conversation with the president of Taiwan indicates, an increasingly assertive China poses the most vexing and far-reaching challenges for American prosperity and security.\n\nChina has accomplished hyper growth supplying Western consumers with inexpensive goods and attracting Western investment to obtain necessary technology, but it has hardly played by the established rules and norms of global trade. It has subsidized exports, manipulated its currency and engaged in other abusive practices.\n\nTrump has promised to slap a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports to get a better deal through existing international agreements, echoing a strategy advocated by Mitt Romney.\n\nThe $320 billion annual deficit on trade in goods and services with China depresses demand for American-made products, curtails funding for U.S.-based R&D, kills millions of jobs and is a principal cause of the blight in communities like Reading, Pa., and Hickory, N.C.\n\nJust as menacing are the trillions of dollars in cumulative trade surpluses China has amassed that are financing a dramatic pivot in its industrial, military and foreign policies, threatening security in the Pacific and America's standing with allies around the globe.\n\nAs wages rise in Chinese coastal manufacturing centers, jobs move farther west in China and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, causing major social disruptions. For example, Dongguan, near Hong Kong, has endured job losses on a scale similar to large Midwestern cities in the U.S.\n\nTo buffer job losses and limit political unrest, Beijing is pursuing a two-pronged strategy.\n\nIt is imposing tougher restrictions on foreign investment, which further depresses the value of the yuan, ladles on more subsidies for basic manufacturing, tightens administration restrictions on imports and consolidates state-owned enterprises to enhance their monopoly power.\n\nSimultaneously, it is encouraging more technology-intensive activities that strike at the heart of American and European competitiveness through lavish subsidies for startups, acquisitions of U.S. and European businesses and toughened regulation of American and other foreign technology companies operating in China. In the process, many products and components used by its basic assembly and fabrication operations, once sourced in the United States and western Europe, are now made in China.\n\nMost of those tactics either violate World Trade Organization rules or are decidedly asymmetrical. For example, the United States, Germany and other European nations generally permit the Chinese to purchase companies outright, whereas Western investors generally must offer Chinese joint-venture partners a substantial stake when establishing subsidiaries in the Middle Kingdom.\n\nWhile Chinese technology still lags behind Western capabilities in many complex and mundane areas, such as rice cookers, it has managed to leap ahead in some fields \u2014 for example, satellite technology for espionage-proof and encrypted communications.\n\nIn addition, the cash earned from its huge trade surpluses is financing a massive buildup in naval and air power, militarization of the South China Sea and about 20 port facilities the Chinese navy can access in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. It also has established an Asian International Development Bank, and the Chinese government and private investors are plowing billions of dollars into the economies in Asia and Africa through infrastructure projects and direct investment.\n\nPresident Obama has been hesitant to take the advice of U.S. defense leaders in challenging China's artificial islands and militarization of the vital South China Sea, and the combination of Chinese muscle and billions in new investment has encouraged the Philippines and Malaysia, longtime U.S. allies, to tilt toward Beijing.\n\nThe latter substantially undermines the U.S. strategy of resolving sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea and securing the sea lanes from Chinese control by relying on the recent U.N. tribunal ruling denying Beijing's claims and through U.S. military and diplomatic cooperation with regional allies.\n\nThe South China Sea has huge seabed mineral deposits and is a vital passage for some $5 trillion of international shipping annually.

Security Council's condemnation of Israeli settlements (all times local):\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nIsrael's prime minister is taking diplomatic action against the countries that co-sponsored a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Jewish settlement construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced the steps early Saturday a few hours after the United States broke with past practice and chose not to veto the measure.\n\nNetanyahu ordered Israel's ambassadors in New Zealand and Senegal to immediately return home for consultations. He also instructed the Foreign Ministry to end all aid programs for Senegal and to cancel a planned visit to Israel by the Senegalese foreign minister.\n\n___\n\n3:45 p.m.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Samantha Power says the Obama administration was delivering the same message that his Republican and Democratic predecessors have been sending for nearly five decades when it allowed the U.N. Security Council to condemn Israeli settlements as \"a flagrant violation\" of international law \u2014 that Israel must stop building settlements.\n\nPower told the council after its 14-0 vote, with the U.S. abstaining, that then Republican president Ronald Reagan said in 1982: \"The United States will not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlements...\"\n\nShe said \"President Reagan's words highlight the United States' longstanding position that Israel settlement activity in territories occupied in 1967 undermines Israel's security, harms the viability of a negotiated two-state outcome, and erodes prospects for peace and stability in the region.\"\n\nShe noted that since 1967, the only U.S. president who had not had at least one Israeli-Palestinian-related Security Council resolution passed during his tenure was Barack Obama.\n\n\"So our vote today is fully in line with the bipartisan history of how American presidents have approached both the issue and the role of this body,\" Power said.\n\n____\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nDonald Trump is reacting to a decision by the United States mission to the United Nations to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.\n\nThe president-elect took to Twitter following the U.N. Security Council vote Friday saying, briefly, \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\"\n\nTrump didn't elaborate, however the move by the Obama administration brushes aside Trump's demands that the U.S. exercise its veto and provided a climax to years of icy relations with Israel's leadership.\n\nTrump told The Associated Press last December that he wanted to be \"very neutral\" on Israel-Palestinian issues. But his tone became decidedly more pro-Israel as the campaign progressed. He has spoken disparagingly of Palestinians, saying they have been \"taken over\" by or are condoning militant groups.\n\n____\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nThe United States has given its biggest rebuke in recent history to longstanding ally Israel, allowing the U.N. Security Council to condemn its settlements and continuing construction in Palestinian territory as a \"flagrant violation\" of international law.\n\nInstead of casting a veto to support Israel, as it almost always does on council resolutions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the U.S. abstained.\n\nThat gave a green light for the council to approve the resolution by a 14-0 vote with U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power abstaining, a move greeted with loud applause in the packed Security Council chamber.\n\nThe resolution says Israel's settlements on Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, have \"no legal validity.\" It demands a halt to \"all Israeli settlement activities,\" saying this \"is essential for salvaging the two-state solution.\"\n\n___\n\n12:05 p.m.\n\nThe Palestinian mission to the United Nations says the Security Council will vote Friday on a resolution condemning Israel's settlement construction, now sponsored by New Zealand, Malaysia, Senegal and Venezuela.\n\nThe mission said the vote would take place Friday but no time has been set.\n\nEgypt, the Arab representative on the Security Council, initially circulated the resolution and called for a vote Thursday but indefinitely postponed the vote.\n\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has not criticized Israeli construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and has announced he will nominate a pro-settlement ambassador, spoke to Egypt's president early Friday, after the postponement was announced.\n\nThe U.S., along with the Palestinians and nearly all of the international community, opposes Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem as obstacles to peace.\n\nAll eyes will be on the U.S. vote on Friday \u2014 whether the Obama administration abstains or vetoes the resolution.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.34190225601196, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 689, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.7062469474699995, "HarmVirtue": 12, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161224000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.07982583454282, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/07/sen-mike-enzi-my-plan-to-put-congress-on-diet-and-fix-our-broken-budget-process.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [663, 1757, 2463, 2615, 2678, 2771, 3506, 3733, 4127, 4364, 4631, 5177]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 828, "scraper_regex": 875}}, "headline": "Sen. Mike Enzi: My plan to put Congress on a 'diet' and fix our broken budget process", "wordcount_as_scraped": 875, "date": "20161207210000", "story_content": "As this year draws to a close, we are once again approaching a federal budget deadline that will likely be postponed. Over the last 40 years, since the modern budget process was established, Congress has enacted 175 temporary spending bills, formally known as 'continuing resolutions,' to avoid doing its job. It's time to change the way Congress does business.\n\nThe November election results showed that hardworking taxpayers are eager for real change. With a new president taking office on January 20th, Congress has an opportunity \u2013 and responsibility \u2013 to get back to work. \u00a0\n\nThe first step must be fixing America's broken budget process to provide our nation with a responsible fiscal blueprint and help guide our spending decisions now and into the future. As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, this will be one of my top priorities in the new congress.\n\nWe are a nation on course for a fiscal disaster, because when it comes to spending money, Congress is like a binge eater. We don't want to start our diet until right AFTER the next dessert. That attitude has led to a mammoth, oversized national debt that, left unchecked, will crush the prosperity of future generations.\n\nWe must start spending within our means and establish healthy fiscal habits. Unfortunately, America's broken budget process makes it easy for Congress to spend without ever checking its fiscal waist line.\n\nCurrently, only thirty percent of the national budget is annually distributed to federal agencies and programs by Congress. This money funds the activities that most people would associate with good government, such as national defense, education, and infrastructure spending.\u00a0\n\nWe must pass spending bills to fund these government activities every year, forcing a public debate about where taxpayer dollars should be spent.\n\nIn fact, this is the portion of the budget that attracts the most congressional scrutiny and debate, and there are limits in place that make it very difficult to spend more than what's allotted. But it is not growing rapidly and is not the cause of our unsustainable fiscal course.\n\nThe real culprit is the other seventy percent of the federal budget that is spent automatically, without regular congressional action or review.\n\nIn just 15 years, it will consume ALL government revenues, as debt interest payments and entitlements continue to grow rapidly.\u00a0 There are no effective limits to the amount that can be spent on this side of the budget, at least until this spending drives America into bankruptcy.\u00a0\n\nThis is how the budget process makes it easy to spend money.\u00a0 There is regular review and strict limits on the small and shrinking portion of the budget.\u00a0 But the much larger automatic spending programs are not regularly reviewed and can grow almost without limit.\n\nTo make matters worse, the historically low interest rates that America has relied on to pay its debt are poised to surge, according to the latest signals from the Federal Reserve. When these rates rise, we can expect to spend more every year on interest payments for these loans than we spend on national defense.\n\nThe Senate Budget Committee has been working on reforms that would fix America's broken budget process. Many of these reforms strengthen the congressional budget, the only existing tool we have that forces Congress to examine all spending and revenues, including automatic spending, over a ten-year period.\u00a0 This budgeting process should be easier to adopt and harder to ignore. Congress can start by reducing the needless political hurdles to passing a budget and making it harder to ignore overspending once Congress agreed to it. \u00a0\n\nThe congressional budget is easily ignored in the Senate because it takes the same number of votes in the Senate to waive a budget violation that it does to overcome filibuster and pass a bill. The fiscal year 2016 budget was tossed aside in less than 5 weeks. Our rules should make it harder to pass a bill that busts the congressional budget by requiring more votes to waive the violation.\u00a0\n\nWe must also create new rules to ensure Congress passes its annual spending measures on time. The current process has been completed on time only four times in the last 40 years, and the last time it was completed on time was in 1998.\u00a0\n\nObviously this year is no exception to the rule. Congress should set aside specific floor time only for consideration of spending bills and enact legislation establishing a two-year spending cycle, so that it has more time to review spending and complete its work.\u00a0 It should also enact Senator Portman's legislation that would end government shutdowns to prevent our annual, end-of-year spending crises.\n\nThese reforms and others would begin to create healthy fiscal habits that would force Congress to recognize and begin to address the daunting fiscal challenges that face our country.\n\nI will continue to tirelessly work to get as many of these budget reforms as possible enacted in the new Congress. It's time to take seriously the crisis that is threatening the future financial solvency of this country.\u00a0\n\nThe American people have spoken, and we owe it to them to put politics aside and get back to work.\n\n\n\nRepublican Mike Enzi represents Wyoming in the United States Senate where he serves as chairman of the Budget Committee.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.5739768743515, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 828, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.71044433838, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.966183574879227, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/04/mosul-today-heaviest-fighting-yet-in-campaign-to-expel-is.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [68]}}, "headline": "Mosul Today: heaviest fighting yet in campaign to expel IS", "wordcount_as_scraped": 568, "date": "20161104170000", "story_content": "BAGHDAD \u2013 \u00a0Heavy fighting erupted in the eastern neighborhoods of Mosul on Friday as Iraqi special forces launched an assault deeper into the urban areas of the city and swung round to attack Islamic State militants from a second entry point, to the northeast.\n\nHere is a look at the main developments on the 19th day of the Mosul Offensive:\n\nNEW ASSAULT IN NORTHEAST\n\nColumns of armored vehicles wound through open desert to open the new front, pushing through dirt berms, drawing heavy fire and calling in airstrikes to enter the middle-class neighborhoods of Tahrir and Zahara. The area was once named after former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.\n\nSeveral explosives-laden vehicles tried to attack the troops but were destroyed, including a bulldozer that was hit by an airstrike from the U.S.-led coalition supporting the offensive. Two vehicles, however, managed to detonate close the advancing forces. An officer and two soldiers were wounded, the army said.\n\nAt least one of the soldiers was wounded seriously in the first hours of the new advance, which came under heavy fire from mortars, automatic weapons, snipers and anti-tank rockets. Commanders at the scene said his injury to the neck could have been the result of small arms fire or shrapnel from a mortar round.\n\nHEAVY FIGHTING IN EAST\n\nEarlier, at the direct eastern approach to the city's urban center, militants holed up in a building fired a rocket at an Abrams tank, disabling it and sending its crew fleeing from the smoking vehicle, seemingly unharmed. The advance in that area then stalled, although later the regular army's ninth division moved forward into nearby neighborhoods.\n\nThe push had begun early in the morning with artillery and mortar strikes on the Aden, Tahrir, and Quds districts, just west of the special forces' footholds in the Gogjali and Karama neighborhoods. Both sides opened up with small arms and mortar fire after an artillery barrage by the special forces, ahead of their advance.\n\nCIVILIANS FLEE\n\nAs Iraqi forces move westward into Mosul, thousands of people have been displaced and are moving further east for shelter. At a road junction in the town of Bartella, convoys of cars queued up to go through checkpoints that led to displaced persons camps.\n\nMore than 1 million civilians are stuck in the city, complicating the military's efforts to advance without harming innocents. IS militants have driven thousands of them deeper into the city's more built-up areas, presumably for use as human shields, while hundreds of others have fled in the past days toward government-controlled territory despite the uncertainty of resettlement in displacement camps.\n\nU.N. CITES REPORTS OF IS KILLING FOR ALLEGED 'DESERTION'\n\nMeanwhile in Geneva, recent accounts of IS abuses were revealed by the United Nations, which said it has new reports that the Islamic State group has been carrying out mass killings in Mosul. Spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said the reports to the group's rights office alleged that IS killed 50 of its own militants on Monday at the Ghazlani military base for alleged \"desertion.\"\n\nShamdasani told reporters that her office also has reports indicating that four women were killed and 17 other civilians wounded in airstrikes on Wednesday in Mosul's Quds neighborhood. She says it was not the first time that her office had received reports of civilian deaths. She also cited reports that IS has been holding nearly 400 women captive in the town of Tal Afar, near Mosul.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.2026801109314, "HarmVice": 13, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 548, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.66804381851, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161104170000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.0145985401459905, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/10/trump-picks-for-attorney-general-dhs-kick-off-week-confirmation-hearings.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1503]}}, "headline": "Trump picks for attorney general, DHS kick off week of confirmation hearings", "wordcount_as_scraped": 769, "date": "20170110070000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump's nominees to lead the departments of Justice and Homeland Security will appear before Senate commitees Tuesday to kick off what is likely to be a contentious confirmation process.\n\nLate Monday, Sen.

John Lewis, D-Ga., and Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La. \u2014 the head of the Congressional Black Caucus \u2014 as part of an effort by Democrats to portray Sessions as out of the mainstream on civil rights legislation.\n\nBooker is believed to be the first sitting Senator to testify in a confirmation hearing against another sitting senator nominated for a Cabinet position.\n\n\"I do not take lightly the decision to testify against a Senate colleague,\" Booker said in a statement. \"But the immense powers of the Attorney General combined with the deeply troubling views of this nominee is a call to conscience.\n\n\"The Attorney General is responsible for ensuring the fair administration of justice, and based on his record, I lack confidence that Senator Sessions can honor this duty,\" the senator added.\n\nDemocrats don't have the power to block the nomination of either Sessions or retired Marine Gen. John Kelly to head DHS, since Republicans control the Senate and only need a simple majority to confirm both men.\u00a0\n\nHowever, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are expected to try and paint Sessions as being out of the mainstream on issues critical to the party's core voters \u2014 Hispanics, African Americans and women \u2014 ahead of the 2018 election cycle.\n\nSessions has been a leading advocate not only for cracking down on illegal immigration, but also for slowing all legal immigration, increasing mass deportations and giving more scrutiny to those entering the United States. He vehemently opposed the bipartisan immigration bill that the Senate passed in 2013 that included a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who worked with Republicans to craft the immigration legislation, indicated last week that he would have a hard time supporting Sessions, saying \"he has been more anti-immigration than just about any other single member of Congress.\"\n\nIn 1986, Sessions was nominated to the federal bench by then-President Ronald Reagan, but was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations that he had called a black attorney \"boy\" \u2014 which he denied \u2014 and described the NAACP and ACLU as \"un-American.\"\n\nLast week, the NAACP staged a sit-in at one of Sessions' Alabama offices, and its legal defense fund said it was \"inconceivable that he should be entrusted with the oversight of our civil rights laws.\"\n\nHank Sanders, a Democratic state senator in Alabama, points to cases Sessions pursued as a prosecutor against civil rights activists in the 1980s. \"They called them voter fraud cases,\" said Sanders, who won acquittals for the defendants. \"I called them voter persecution cases.\"\n\nHowever, Albert Turner Jr., the son of two of those defendants recently said he believed Sessions \"is not a racist\" and \"was simply doing his job\" when he prosecuted the cases.\n\nSupporters describe Sessions as a man of integrity who fought for desegregation during his career as a local GOP leader, prosecutor and elected official.\n\nAs U.S. attorney, Sessions' office investigated and helped secure convictions in the 1981 Ku Klux Klan lynching of Michael Donald, a black teenager found hanging from a tree.\n\nGreg Griffin, a black Alabama judge who worked as a state attorney when Sessions was Alabama attorney general, told the Associated Press over the weekend that Sessions \"always treated me with respect\" and called him \"one of the best bosses I ever had.\"\n\nWhile in the Senate, Sessions voted to confirm Obama's first attorney general, Eric Holder, the first black man to lead the Justice Department. He also worked with Democratic colleagues on efforts to combat prison rape and to reduce federal sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses, saying the gap unfairly targeted the \"African-American community simply because that is where crack is most often used.\"\n\nKelly, who is expected to be easily confirmed by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the full Senate, would be the first non-civilian to head DHS since the department was created in 2002. He is expected to be questioned closely about his views on border security.\n\nTrump famously vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico when he announced his run for president, and stuck to that vow throughout the campaign.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.94410693645477, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 740, "FairnessVirtue": 7, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.80495429464, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110070000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.0, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/09/why-have-high-hopes-for-betsy-devos-to-lead-trump-s-education-department.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [320, 329, 335, 684, 690, 747, 777, 783, 1034, 1061, 1067, 2055, 2061, 2841, 2847, 3081, 3087, 3959, 4687, 4693, 5051, 5057, 5197, 5203, 5209, 5466, 5472, 5584]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 859, "scraper_regex": 953}}, "headline": "Why I have high hopes for Betsy DeVos to lead Trump\u2019s Education Department ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 953, "date": "20161209230000", "story_content": "I remember the quote well, \"My daughter used to walk over hypodermic needles and through metal detectors -- just to enter the very school that the government deemed a failure. But now, with her scholarship, she's safe and thriving academically.\"\u00a0\n\nBefore\u00a0Betsy\u00a0DeVos, thousands of parents, mostly minority and below the poverty line, like the one I talked to a few years ago, lacked the empowerment to make decisions that shaped their child's destiny. The government, faced with no competition and an appetite for protecting its power, taught one way -- their way, with little to no innovation. That was until\u00a0Betsy\u00a0DeVos began her education reform movement in the 1990's.\u00a0\n\nI've been lucky to work for\u00a0Betsy\u00a0and her various education reform organizations since 2005 in Louisiana, Washington, D.C., and nine other states \u2013 all with the mindset of supporting policy and candidates that passionately want to empower parents to make decisions for their children.\u00a0\n\nAnd that's the legacy of\u00a0Betsy\u00a0DeVos. A change agent that doesn't talk the talk, but walks the walk -by investing her time, people and yes, money, to save children trapped in failing schools. That investment, in a multitude of states, is an overwhelming success because the ultimate outcome is to shift power away from government and give it to parents who simply know how to best educate their child.\n\nIn 1963, Alabama governor George Wallace stood in the schoolhouse door to block Vivian Malone and James Hood from enrolling at the University of Alabama. As a native Alabamian, it still serves as a symbol of hate and discrimination that was an embarrassment to my state, and our nation. That symbol has a new dichotomy today; and it's the very media, government officials and teachers unions that stand in front of poor, mostly minority families, denying their child access to the best education possible. That drug called power does not help children or parents. And Donald Trump should be commended for nominating\u00a0Betsy\u00a0DeVos to blow it up.\n\nBut the school choice opposition's voice is not overt like Wallace in the 60s. They wrap themselves in poll tested phrasing to win the PR war. How long have we heard the media and union officials say education reformers want to \"destroy public education\" and speak in terms of letting their allies create new education plans that will work over time, \"Just give it 10 years\" they say \u2013 only to hear the same verbiage used 10 years later after another failure and lost generation of children.\n\nBetsy's philosophy has always been that we need to stand up for those left behind right now, not in 10 years, not even tomorrow. Children's lives today are worth just as much as those who will be around in 10 years.\n\nCase in point, the state of Louisiana. In 2008,\u00a0Betsy\u00a0worked across the aisle by recruiting two Democratic African-American legislators to sponsor the Louisiana Scholarship Program (with a reform minded governor in Bobby Jindal). And it passed that year for only the city of New Orleans.\u00a0Betsy\u00a0didn't stop there. She immediately began working to expand the program statewide so all children could benefit. The unions, media and even some allies, told her not to do it \u2013 it was going to be treacherous. She kept fighting. By 2012, the Louisiana legislature passed a statewide scholarship law.\n\nBetsy's diligent focus on education reform in Louisiana helped pull students trapped in failing schools out of the abyss. The results? According to the 2015/16 Louisiana Department of Education annual report, the state now has over 74,000 students enrolled in charter schools and it has gone from zero private school scholarships awarded (to students in poor performing schools), to approximately 8,000 today (and the program is in demand, receiving double the amount of applicants every year), bringing the total publicly funded choice enrollment to over 82,000 students.\u00a0\n\nBetsy's organization, the American Federation for Children, has conducted a parent survey in Louisiana, over the past seven years, to gauge the opinions of the parents whose children were being served by the private scholarship program. The results are staggering \u201391.2% of scholarship parents are satisfied with the program, 91.6% of parents have seen academic progress with their child, and 98.6% say their child is safe and welcomed in their school.\n\nBetsy's edict was always clear \u2013 we weren't waiting for the \"10 year plan\" to run its course. She acted fast and swift and it may have saved an entire generation of Louisiana's most vulnerable children.\n\nCharter school laws and the scholarship program were passed because\u00a0Betsy\u00a0DeVos led. She wasn't dogmatic about the vouchers or charter schools; she was dogmatic on making sure we empowered parents to make the best education decision for their kids.\n\nLeadership on the education reform issue means having a tough skin and you know you've hit a nerve when the teachers unions are in full-panic mode since PEOTUS Donald J. Trump named\u00a0Betsy\u00a0DeVos secretary of education-designate. No doubt there will be a contentious confirmation looming once the new administration takes office.\u00a0\n\nBut\u00a0Betsy\u00a0DeVos is standing up to the bullies in the schoolhouse door. She has stood up for those without a voice and she's done it by aggressively championing their stories at the ballot box and in the halls of government. \n\nThe education world has changed and with\u00a0Betsy\u00a0as the next Secretary of Education, more of that is yet to come.\n\n\n\nPhillip Stutts is CEO of Go BIG Media, Inc.\u00a0He has worked for education reform clients since 2005 (including the American Federation for Children, All Children Matter, the Black Alliance for Educational Options, and multiple charters schools). Stutts was also an appointee to the Department of Education under President George W. Bush.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.584795296192169, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 859, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.55876619995, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.86263096623981, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/07/pakistan-airline-chairman-pilot-lost-control-engine-made-mayday-call-before-crash.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3318]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 547, "scraper_regex": 587}}, "headline": "Pakistan airline chairman: Pilot lost control of engine, made \u2018mayday call\u2019 before crash", "wordcount_as_scraped": 587, "date": "20161207200000", "story_content": "The pilot of the ill-fated Pakistan International Airlines plane that crashed into a mountain on Wednesday killing everyone on board reportedly lost control of one of the engines, the airline chairman said.\n\nAzam Sehgal, PIA's chairman, told reporters that the pilot for flight PK661 told the control tower at 4:09 p.m. local time that an engine had developed a technical fault and moments later made a \"mayday call\" shortly before the plane disappeared.\n\n\"We were confident that the plane could land with one working engine,\" he said, adding: \"I think that there was no technical error or human error\u2026 obviously there will be a proper investigation.\"\n\nThe small twin-propeller aircraft was enroute from Chitral to the capital when it crashed near the town of Havelian, about 45 miles northwest of Islamabad.

We have 1,100 excited families looking forward to a happy Christmas when for weeks they had been sick with worry about their futures. And we have a news media unable to report on success.\n\nHow? President-elect Donald Trump convinced Carrier to keep 1,100 jobs in the United States. He was helped by Vice President-elect Mike Pence who had additional interest in and leverage over this decision because he is Governor of Indiana where Carrier is located.\n\nThe people employed at Carrier are ecstatic.\n\nThey were about to face a gloomy Christmas. Now they have their jobs and they are thrilled that the President-elect intervened decisively and successfully.\n\nThis was actually Trump's second intervention. (He earlier convinced Ford not to move one of its assembly lines to Mexico.) But because the media focused so much on the 1,100 jobs, and because Carrier's management had been so much more public about its determination to move to Mexico, the Carrier case has acquired much more intensity and importance than Ford.\n\nThere are several important points about this achievement.\n\nFirst, this was pure Trumpism. Don't wait to be inaugurated. Don't spend a lot of time with staff studying the issue. Don't delegate to someone else and hope for the best.\n\nTrumpism includes intuitive decisions followed by rapid, personal intervention to force success. Its clearest predecessor in style was President Theodore Roosevelt. Trump is similar to Roosevelt in the sheer exuberant energy with which he lives out each day.\n\nWinston Churchill had slips of paper in World War II that read \"Action this Day\". He clipped them to important items in an effort to force the bureaucracy to move faster. Trump is a living example of \"Action this Day\".\n\nSecond, Trump understands that winning the right symbolic victories early can have very big consequences. Scott Adams wrote brilliantly on this technique. Millions of Americans who worry about their jobs feel better today knowing that Donald Trump cared enough to act before he was even sworn in. While the propaganda media (formerly the news media) and the critics may think this was a small achievement, it was symbolically and emotionally a big achievement.\n\nThird, Trump understands that winning is always better than losing. Americans have watched Barack Obama fail to save jobs. In fact, he mocked Trump and publicly asked if he was going to wave a \"magic wand\" to save jobs at Carrier. Now it is Obama who looks impotent and incompetent \u2013 and Trump looks like maybe he has a magic wand.\n\nIn history, winning increases the likelihood of winning. Losing increases the likelihood of losing. Today, President-elect Trump looks like a winner.\n\nFinally, Trumpism is transforming the roles of our two political parties. While Democratic elitists are mocking the Carrier achievement and minimizing its importance, millions of blue collar Americans are glad someone finally cares about them. The isolation of the Democrats into a left-wing club of clueless and out-of-touch elitists continues. The transformation of the Republican Party into the party that cares about families and jobs moves forward.\n\nEleven hundred happy families at Christmas is a big deal.\n\nThis year it is Donald Trump's deal. It is quite an achievement seven weeks before being sworn in as President of the United States.\n\n\n\nNewt Gingrich, a Republican, was speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 1999.

Only their tormenters would have heard their cries since the other children at the school were deaf.\n\nThe clerical sex abuse scandal unfolding at the Antonio Provolo Institute for hearing impaired children in Mendoza province would be shocking enough on its own. Except that dozens of students in the Provolo Institute's school in Italy were similarly abused for decades, allegedly by the same priest who now stands accused of raping and molesting young deaf Argentines.\n\nAnd the Vatican knew about him since at least 2009, when the Italy victims went public with tales of shocking abuse against the most vulnerable of children and named names. In 2014, the Italian victims wrote directly to Pope Francis again naming the Rev. Nicola Corradi as a pedophile and flagged that he was living in Francis' native Argentina. Yet apparently, nothing was done.\n\nAt least 24 students of the Provolo institute in Argentina have now come forward seeking justice for the abuse they say they suffered at the hands of Corradi, 82, another priest, the Rev. Horacio Corbacho, 55, and three other men. The five were arrested in late November by police who raided the school and found magazines featuring naked women and about $34,000 in Corradi's room.\n\nAll the suspects are being held at a jail in Mendoza and have not spoken publicly since their arrest.\n\n\"From the pope down ... all of the Catholic Church hierarchy is the same. They all knew,\" one of the Mendoza victims told The Associated Press through a sign language interpreter.\n\nAnother victim said the priests would rape again if released.\n\n\"This happened in Italy ... it happened again here, and it must end,\" the victim said, insisting on speaking anonymously. \"Enough!\"\n\nVictims and prosecutors say the anal and vaginal rapes, fondling and oral sex by the priests took place in the bathrooms, dorms, garden and a basement at the school in Lujan de Cuyo, a city about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) northwest of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe school has \"a little chapel with an image of the Virgin and some chairs where the kids would get confession and receive the communion. That's where some of the acts were happening,\" Fabrizio Sidoti, the prosecutor who has been leading the investigation since the scandal broke, told the AP.\n\nChildren from other regions of Argentina who lived at the dorms were especially vulnerable and often targeted by the abusers. The tales are harrowing: One of the victims told the AP she witnessed how a girl was raped by one priest while the other one forced her to give him oral sex.\n\nThe prosecutor is expecting more than 20 other people to provide testimony and more victims to come forward.\n\nPope Francis has not spoken publicly about the case and the Vatican declined to comment.\n\nAdvocates of sex abuse victims by priests question how Francis could have been unaware of Corradi's misdeeds, given he was publicly named by the Italy victims.\n\n\"No other pope has spoken as passionately about the evil of child sex abuse as Francis. No other pope has invoked 'zero tolerance' as often. No other pope has promised accountability of church superiors,\" said Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability, an online resource about clerical abuse. \"In light of the crimes against the helpless children in Mendoza, the Pope's assurances seem empty indeed.\"\n\nOn Dec. 11, the pope appeared in a video using sign language to wish deaf people worldwide a merry Christmas \u2014 a gesture that fell particularly flat in Argentina as Catholics struggle with the enormity of the scandal.\n\n\"Either he lives outside of reality or this is enormously cynical ... it's a mockery,\" said Carlos Lombardi, an attorney who specializes in canon law.\n\nThe Provolo case first exploded in Italy in 2009, when the Italian victims went public with stories of abuse after what they said were three useless years of negotiations with the diocese of Verona, where the institute has its Italy headquarters.\n\nThe 67 victims alleged sexual abuse, pedophilia and corporal punishment at the hands of priests, brothers and lay religious from the 1950s to the 1980s. At the time, 14 of the victims wrote sworn statements and videotaped their testimony detailing the abuse they suffered. They named 24 priests, lay religious and religious brothers in a list that was published online.\n\nCorradi was one of those included in the list, which specified he was in Argentina at that time.\n\nIn 2010, the Vatican ordered the Verona diocese to investigate the claims. One of the victims named Corradi during the inquiry.\n\nBut he apparently was never sanctioned. Five other accused were.\n\nThe Italian victims didn't stop.\n\nOn Dec. 31, 2013, they wrote to the pope asking him to institute an independent commission of inquiry to investigate clerical sex abuse in Italy.\n\nOn Oct. 20, 2014, they wrote Francis and the Verona bishop naming 14 priests and lay religious from the institute who were still alive and in ministry who allegedly had sexually abused them. They named Corradi, and noted that he and three others were in Argentina.\n\n\"We must point out that the behavior of the church is not in the least bit in line with the 'zero tolerance' stance of Pope Francis,\" they wrote, listing the 14 priests and their current locations. \"Such behavior makes us think that the church has no interest in the suffering provoked by priests who sexually abused deaf children, priests who continue to live their lives normally, priests who never apologized to victims, priests who never asked forgiveness and for whom the church itself attempts to let the time pass in hopes that everything is forgotten.\"\n\nNo response was immediately received.\n\nMore than two years later, the Vatican's No. 3 official, Monsignor Angelo Becciu, acknowledged receipt of the letters. In a Feb. 5, 2016, response, he said that as far as the Provolo victims' request for a commission of inquiry was concerned, he had forwarded the proposal to the Italian Bishops' Conference.\n\nThe Italian Bishops' Conference didn't respond to an email seeking comment on whether such a commission was under consideration.\n\n\"I'm convinced that some hierarchy covered this up. They sent the wolf to take care of the sheep,\" said Alejandro Gulle, the chief prosecutor in Mendoza.\n\nThe Mendoza Archbishopric says it was unaware of the accusations against Corradi. \"A religious man comes to a diocese and you trust the legitimate superior,\" spokesman Marcelo De Benedectis said.\n\nHe said that allegations aired by the case have been \"so outrageous,\" the Mendoza diocese has taken measures like demanding a sworn statement from religious people stating that they don't have \"backgrounds\" under canon or civil law.\n\nThe Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has been informed about the Mendoza accusations, he added.\n\nUnlike the Verona case, the alleged crimes in Mendoza have not expired due to the statute of limitations and could lead to up to 50-year jail sentences for a conviction.\n\nA prosecutor is also probing accusations by a man who says he was abused at the Provolo Institute in the city of La Plata when Corradi first arrived in Argentina in the 1980s.\n\n\"We want justice to be served. We might be able to get long sentences. I hope they're the maximum,\" said Gulle, the Mendoza prosecutor. \"But we'll never compensate the spiritual damage suffered by these children.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Paul Byrne and AP writers Luis Andres Henao in Buenos Aires and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.5978512763977095, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1195, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 21, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.89859207182, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 6, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161223060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.17991631799163, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/28/controversial-kenyan-railway-plan-divides-conservationists.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [75]}}, "headline": "Controversial Kenyan railway plan divides conservationists", "wordcount_as_scraped": 901, "date": "20161128110000", "story_content": "NAIROBI, Kenya \u2013 \u00a0A controversial Chinese-designed railway that would go over a beloved protected wildlife park in Kenya's capital has divided conservationists in this East African country known for its safari tourism.\n\nSome are staging protests even as other wildlife experts insist the project is environmentally sound.\n\nNairobi enjoys a reputation as the wildlife capital of the world thanks to the expansive Nairobi National Park, which in 1946 became Kenya's first sanctuary for wildlife. Its 117 square kilometers (45 sq. miles) of wilderness abuts the city, and is a key attraction for visitors who are able to see herds of giraffe or zebra roaming free with Nairobi's skyline clearly outlined behind them.\n\nThe Kenya Railway Corporation is in the process of building a new 600-kilometer (370-mile) railway to link Nairobi to the port of Mombasa on the Indian Ocean coast. The estimated cost of the railway line is $3.8 billion, with 90 percent of the financing provided by China Exim Bank. The project's engineers say the most affordable route will bring the railway across Nairobi park and are building a 6-kilometer (4-mile) bridge over the national reserve, at an elevation that they say will not interfere with wildlife movements.\n\nChinese companies are building the railway, envisaged as a modern alternative to the colonial-era line from the coast. It is planned that the railway will eventually be extended to link Nairobi to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.\n\nThose who support the project, including the Kenyan government and railway authorities, say the railway is vital for Kenya's economic development, but its detractors argue that the project is being rushed for political reasons and without sufficient consideration of its threat to the country's wildlife.\n\nAmid protests over the railway, a coalition of Kenyan conservationists has obtained a court order stopping construction within the park until an environmental impact assessment is completed by Kenya's National Environmental Management Authority, or NEMA, and is considered by the court.\n\nA preliminary report by NEMA said the railway will have no adverse effect on the park and its wildlife, drawing the ire of independent groups that accused the government agency of corruption. More protests to march on the NEMA headquarters are being planned.\n\nAkshay Vishwanath, chairman of Friends of Nairobi National Park, which is part of the coalition of conservation groups hoping to stop the railway from proceeding through the park, said they are concerned any incursion into the protected area will compromise the park's integrity.\n\n\"It should not go in, over or under the national park,\" Vishwanath said. \"There is a reason there are national parks, you know. They are protected areas, protected for a certain land use, and that is conservation and habitat for wildlife and biodiversity.\"\n\nBut conservationists associated with the government, including the park managers, Kenya Wildlife Service, have backed the project.\n\n\"It is very clear what the constitution requires and I believe everything that KWS and the railways is doing are within the bounds and limits of the constitution,\" Kenya Wildlife Service Chairman Richard Leakey, who formally announced the railway would be permitted to cross over the park last September, told a news conference. \"Yes, lawyers and activists can query that, but the point is: We are not dirtying the park. What we are doing is putting a railway line across it, above it, and what we are doing is, yes, I can tell you that we are offending the eyesight. People who want to look across the park and say it is very beautiful will see a railway line but so what?\"\n\nThe average height of the bridge pillars is high enough for even the tallest land mammal, the giraffe, to \"pass through very, very comfortably without causing any obstruction to their movements,\" said Christian Odhiambo, a structural engineer with the Kenya Railway Corporation.\n\nKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is due for re-election next year, is strongly in favor of the railway, saying it does not violate any of the country's laws.\n\n\"There are some that are saying if this railway is built it will destroy the Nairobi park. This is nonsense ... The park will still be there and we would like them to stop inciting people, to stop taking people to court,\" Kenyatta said recently. \"Let us build the railway. Kenya wants to develop and the animals will still be guarded and taken care of and the world will go on. I want to assure you that nothing will happen that will destroy the Nairobi park.\"\n\nNairobi National Park is home to Kenya's most successful rhino sanctuary as well as many herbivores, lions and other big cats.

It was a 100-year-old Methodist church with groaning floorboards that announced your arrival for the poll workers before you were halfway across the floor.\n\n Dim, dusty and sacred.\n\n For what is Election Day but the highest holiday of the great civic religion of our republic? Slightly shuffling and self-conscious voters \u2013 a man getting off his shift at the landfill down the road, an old woman in a quilted housecoat and one young newspaper reporter \u2013 waited silently for their turn.\n\n There, in that dignified but humble place, the miracle of the single most successful enterprise in human self-governance was present.\n\n America leads the world by many measures. And surely one of them is in taking gifts for granted. And there at the top of the list of blessings seldom counted is that miracle: that for 227 years Americans have governed themselves and done so mostly with wisdom, temperance and justice.\n\n It would be the envy of all the world if everyone in the world could even conceive of such a possibility. But for those who can dream of a place in which leaders peacefully step aside at the decision of the people \u2013 where the law, not men, rules \u2013 today is an amazement.\n\n We have complained bitterly about this year's election. And we no doubt have had cause. Promiscuous dishonesty, cruelty, fear mongering, hate, conspiracy and an arrogant disregard for the most important issues facing the nation.\n\n We have watched the individuals and institutions tasked with keeping the republic \u2013 the parties, the candidates, the press, the justice system \u2013 fail to live up to their duties. Some of it has been just dereliction. Some of it has been intentional harm.\n\n And for that, we all share some the blame. We have learned to settle for less when only the best should do. We have shrugged off corruption and cruelty within a system bought with the blood and toil of a dozen generations. We have all been unworthy of our heritage, even if only by standing silent in the face of the abuses of others.\n\n But still, 2016 is a gift.\n\n Americans are not free and secure because we are the most prosperous country in the world. We are prosperous because we are free and secure. The stability and adaptability of a system that tempers the demands of the masses with republican restraint but holds leaders accountable to the ultimate authority of the people has allowed the fullest flowering of human potential the world has ever seen.\n\n And a system so free and stable depends on our great charter, but that charter rests squarely on the shoulders of the people. Our Constitution is worthless without a people virtuous enough to accept the responsibilities of freedom.\n\nMuch of what we see today doesn't look very virtuous. Much of what we see reflects brokenness. In big cities and in rural America, we see and feel the unraveling. The old institutions seem unworthy of the challenges of today. Families, congregations, schools, businesses, civic organizations are losing ground in the battle to maintain a culture capable of liberty.\n\n Stand in the pre-dawn fog outside of a methadone clinic in Appalachia and you know. Walk through packs of loitering, sulky young men in a big city and you know. Hear the desperation in the voices of the elderly in a rundown nursing home and you know.\n\n America's remarkable amount of social capital bought this freedom. But maybe we don't have enough left in the bank to keep it.\n\n But go back to that little church in West Virginia and see those voters in line. See them tread respectfully to the front to participate in this pageant.\n\n See that same little miracle play out 100 million times today. In Manhattan high rises. In Texas barrios. In Kansas schoolhouses. Farmers voting before the sun rises. Factory workers voting after the sun has set. Parents with children covered in \"I voted\" stickers. Black voters born in states where they were barred from the ballot box.\n\n Now that's one helluva lot of social capital.\n\n This campaign has reflected the very worst of a system that is failing to live up to its duty or the public trust. But this election is still a reflection of the best of us. The faithful actions of these tens of millions of Americans is an inherently hopeful and, yes, virtuous, thing.\n\n It is reason enough to believe that some of what's wrong may be put right if only because enough Americans still care enough to show up and demand better.\n\n Fox News Halftime Report takes no editorial positions on candidates or policies. We're just political meteorologists here to tell you which way the winds blow. But we've done all the prognostication we can. You know what the polls said. You know what the candidates did. It is, as they would say on the North Fork of Short Creek, all over but the shouting.\n\n But we will take this one position: Election Day ought to be a federal holiday.\n\n This should be a day of obligation and celebration when as many Americans as possible are given the chance to participate and to reflect on the rights with which they were endowed and to consider what kind of government is necessary to protect them.\n\n And whether your preferred candidates win or loses today, thank you for showing your hope, courage and faithfulness by even showing up. And thank you also for your readership throughout this remarkable cycle.\n\n AMERICA'S ELECTION HEADQUARTERS HAS YOU COVERED\nToday is the day that America decides who will lead us through the next four years.

Gen. Michael Flynn on Friday accepted President-elect Donald Trump's offer to be his national security adviser, Fox News confirmed.\u00a0\n\nFlynn, who served as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) between 2012 and 2014, has advised Trump on national security issues for months. As national security adviser, he would work in the White House and have frequent access to the president.\n\nThe position does not require confirmation by the Senate. Whoever holds it is typically shielded from congressional requests to testify or produce documents.\n\nGENERAL VS. GENERAL: POWELL, FLYNN FEUD OVER HACKED EMAIL SLAMS\n\nAfter leaving the DIA, Flynn became a virulent critic of the Obama administration and the Pentagon.\u00a0He took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting ISIS and, more generally, its handling of global affairs.\n\nFlynn asserted that he had been forced out of the DIA because he disagreed with the administration's approach to combating extremism. His critics, however, claimed he had mismanaged the agency and that his efforts to force change had met with internal resistance.\n\n\nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at July's Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by ISIS requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow.\n\nFlynn is also a champion of renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal, another foreign policy theme Trump pushed during the campaign.\n\nBut Flynn's warmth toward Russia has worried some national security experts. Flynn traveled last year to Moscow, where he joined Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials in a celebration of the RT network, Russia's government-controlled television channel. Flynn later explained that he had been paid for taking part in the event, but brushed aside concerns that he was aiding a Russian propaganda effort.\n\n\nFlynn has also been outspoken in his alarms about the dangers of Islamist groups, complaining on CNN in June that the U.S. needs to \"discredit\" radical Islam, but that \"we're not allowed to do that right now.\" He blamed the Obama administration in a New York Post op-ed in July for failing to design a coherent strategy for opposing ISIS. And in August, he spoke at an event in Dallas for the anti-Islamist group Act for America, saying that Islam \"is a political ideology\" and that it \"definitely hides behind being a religion.\"\n\n\nFlynn's dark warnings about Islam have not extended to the Islamist-leaning authoritarian Turkish government headed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In an op-ed for the Washington newspaper The Hill just before the election, Flynn wrote that \"our ally Turkey\" needs support and echoed Erdogan's warnings that a \"shady\" Turkish leader now exiled in Pennsylvania should not be given safe harbor in the U.S. Erdogan has called for the extradition of the exile, Fethullah Gullen, but the Obama administration has made no move to comply.\n\n\nFlynn's military experience might have made him seem like a natural choice to lead the Pentagon. But without a waiver from Congress, he is not eligible to be secretary of defense because federal law says \"a person may not be appointed as secretary of defense within seven years after relief from active duty as a commissioned officer.\"\n\nTwo sources told Fox News earlier this week that Flynn's potential appointment is seen by Trump's team as a way to tap into his national security expertise, without subjecting him to intensive questioning.\n\nDuring the campaign, Flynn was thought of as a potential running mate for Trump. However, he appeared to fall out of favor after implying that he was pro-choice in a television interview.\n\nFLYNN CLARIFIES HIS ABORTION STANCE, SAYS HE'S 'PRO-LIFE'\n\nFlynn told ABC's \"This Week\" in July that women \"have to make the decision [on abortion] because they are the ones that are going to decide to bring up that child or not.\" The day after the interview aired, he told Fox News that he was a \"pro-life Democrat.\"\n\nWith his public and fervent support for Trump, highlighted by his July convention appearance, Flynn challenged the military's apolitical traditions. He was not alone in that role. John Allen, a retired Marine general, spoke at the Democratic National Convention as a Hillary Clinton supporter. Their former colleague, retired Gen. Martin Dempsey, wrote in The Washington Post that Flynn and Allen were wrong to have participated as they did.\n\n\n\"The military is not a political prize,\" Dempsey wrote. \"The American people should not wonder where their military leaders draw the line between military advice and political preference.\"\n\n\nFlynn would not be the first retired general to be asked to serve as part of a president's national security team. Obama appointed retired Army Gen. David Petraeus as CIA director in 2011.\n\n\nColin Powell, who had served as chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff at the pinnacle of his Army career, became secretary of state during President George W. Bush's first term. He also served as national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan from 1987 to 1989 while retaining his Army commission as a lieutenant general.\n\n\nRetired Marine Gen. James Jones, a former commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Europe, served as Obama's first national security adviser.\n\n\nFox News' Ed Henry and James Rosen and the Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.434153407812119, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 641, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.801859144090001, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161118030000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.460218408736349, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/13/trumps-presidential-pen-could-remake-supreme-courts-agenda.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4769]}}, "headline": "Trump's presidential pen could remake Supreme Court's agenda", "wordcount_as_scraped": 750, "date": "20161113200000", "story_content": "Even before Donald Trump chooses a Supreme Court nominee, the new president can take steps to make several contentious court cases go away.\n\nLegal challenges involving immigration, climate change, cost-free contraceptive care and transgender rights all could be affected, without any help from Congress.\n\nThe cases turn on Obama administration policies that rely on the president's pen, regulations or decisions made by federal agencies. And what one administration can do, the next can undo.\n\nIt is not uncommon for the court's docket to change when one party replaces the other in the White House. \n\nThat change in direction is magnified by the high-court seat Trump will get to fill after Senate Republicans refused to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland.\n\n\"We were hoping we'd be looking forward to a progressive majority on the Supreme Court. After the election results, there is a new reality,\" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center.\n\nThe Supreme Court already is set to consider a case involving a transgender teen who was born female, but identifies as a male and wants to use the boys' bathroom at his Virginia high school. \n\nWhen the federal appeals court in Richmond ruled in student Gavin Grimm's favor this year, it relied on a determination by the U.S. Education Department that federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education also applies to gender identity.\n\nThe new administration could withdraw the department's guidance, which could cause the justices to return the case to the lower courts to reach their own decision about whether the law requires schools to allow students to use bathrooms and locker rooms based on their gender identity.\n\n\"It is possible, maybe even likely, that if the first question went away, then the court would send case back to the 4th circuit\" in Richmond, said Steven Shapiro, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Grimm.\n\nTrump already has pledged to undo Obama's plan to shield millions of people living in the country illegally from deportation and to make them eligible for work permits. \n\nThe Supreme Court, down to eight members after Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February, split 4 to 4 in June over the plan. The tie vote effectively killed the plan for Obama's presidency because lower federal courts had previously blocked it.\n\nBut the issue remains a live one in the legal system, and supporters of the Obama plan had hoped that a new Clinton administration would press forward.\n\nNow, though, all Trump has to do is rescind the Obama team's actions, which would leave the courts with nothing to decide.\n\nA similar fate may be in store for the current administration's efforts to get cost-free birth control to women who are covered by health plans from religiously-affiliated educational and charitable organizations. The justices issued an unusual order in the spring that directed lower courts across the country to seek a compromise to end the legal dispute. \n\nThe groups already can opt out of paying for contraception, but they say that option leaves them complicit in providing government-approved contraceptives to women covered by their plans.\n\nThe new administration could be more willing to meet the groups' demands, which would end the controversy.\n\nWomen's contraceptives are among a range of preventive services that the Obama health overhaul requires employers to cover in their health plans. All of that now is at risk, since Trump has called for repeal of the health care law.\n\nObama's Clean Power Plan, calling for cuts in carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants, also could be rolled back once Trump is in office.\n\nThe federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., is considering a challenge by two-dozen mostly Republican-led states that say Obama overstepped his authority. \n\nThe Trump team could seek to undo the rules put in place by the Environmental Protection Agency and it could seek a delay in the litigation while doing so, said Sean Donahue, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund. \n\nTrump's EPA would have to propose its own rules, which allow for public comment and legal challenges from those who object, Donahue said.\n\nEnvironmental groups effectively fought rules that they said eased pollution limits during George W. Bush's presidency.\n\nAs some issues pushed by Obama recede in importance, others that have been important to conservatives may get renewed interest at the court. \n\nAmong those are efforts to impose new restrictions on public-sector labor unions and to strike down more campaign-finance limits, including the ban on unlimited contributions to political parties.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.249687895178795, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 748, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.12811827892, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161113200000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 4.14438502673797, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/25/with-trump-in-white-house-states-could-step-up-on-climate-change.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [436, 458, 498, 531, 557, 600, 615, 1010, 1029, 2026, 2051, 2813, 2907, 2939, 3106, 3128, 3338, 3375, 3531, 4584]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 719, "scraper_regex": 778}}, "headline": "With Trump in the White House, states could step up on climate change", "wordcount_as_scraped": 778, "date": "20161125160000", "story_content": "There are still many unknowns about President-elect Donald Trump's likely course when it comes to climate change policy, but his campaign trail rhetoric has signaled that his administration may drop the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan, more aggressively develop fossil fuels and loosen environmental regulations.\n\nWhile this is not unexpected given\u00a0the president-elect's\u00a0stated skepticism about climate change,\u00a0it is worth keeping in mind that\u00a0states may well choose to\u00a0pursue their own environmental initiatives\u00a0in this arena.\u00a0\n\nFor more than 40 years, the United States has achieved significant environmental progress despite differing regional economic interests, environmental impacts, and levels of environmental concern by allowing some states to lead the way. Enactment of the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Clean Water Act of 1972, and other landmark environmental legislation followed a similar pattern. In each case,\u00a0states led the way\u00a0with new approaches that the federal government later adopted. Each of these laws struck a balance between consistent federal legal standards applicable to interstate commerce (good for business and the economy) and state-centric compliance and enforcement. Indeed, states' rights were a cornerstone of the compromises that Congress struck in the 1970s as it tackled one environmental issue after another.\n\nIt is often said that states are the laboratories of democracy. State level experiments may prove particularly important for addressing climate change, because states have greater freedom to pursue significant institutional and technological innovation. National and global efforts to reduce carbon emissions from all aspects of the economy (known as decarbonization) will proceed more quickly and easily if states can demonstrate decarbonization is possible and affordable.\n\nSome states are already among the most innovative regions in the world in advancing climate policy. For instance,\u00a0California has pioneered\u00a0a carbon trading system and energy efficiency programs that have kept per capita energy use nearly flat for decades amidst a fast growing economy and population. It also has established new low carbon fuel standards and significantly increased its use of low-carbon energy. New York is a leader in deploying technology and a new regulatory system to enable a more efficient, more resilient, and more renewable-friendly smart grid. As part of the Governors' Accord for a New Energy Future, Michigan is aggressively pursuing energy efficiency and renewable energy strategies. These states are betting that their actions will drive innovation within their borders and create new jobs and opportunities for their citizens. They are not alone: 29 states have adopted\u00a0renewable energy standards; and every state offers some form of tax credits or other types of\u00a0incentives for renewable energy\u00a0sources. Their experiences are building America's knowledge base and stimulating new technologies and economic opportunities. There are now more people working in the\u00a0solar energy industry\u00a0than in oil and gas fields.\n\nFederal law gives states significant leeway in these pursuits. For example, for the express purpose of enabling experimentation, the Clean Air Act specifically allows states to set\u00a0more stringent air quality standards\u00a0for all sources of pollution. They should be allowed to keep going unimpeded, even if the federal government moves in a different direction. Some fear that\u00a0President-elect Trump's campaign commitment to bringing jobs back to communities most dependent on the fossil fuel industry will result in scaling back the federal commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the name of harmonizing regulations, it is possible that the new administration could take actions to impede the ability of states to forge more aggressive climate policies if they so choose.\n\nHowever, there is no credible policy purpose, or likely existing legal basis, to hinder states that choose to make different judgments about mitigation of climate change and their economic future by continuing to pursue their own climate policies. Hindering states could do more to damage technological innovation and a growing economy than might initially be apparent.\n\nThe stated goals of the new administration include growing the economy with good jobs, promoting foreign policies that demonstrate strength and leadership and reducing the influence of moneyed interests in Washington. Curbing states' rights to innovate on climate policies\u00a0would move in the opposite direction and undermine an ongoing U.S. leadership opportunity.

Why they can't have a five minute conversation or whatever it was to say congratulations doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\"\n\n \"I think the Trump administration will have to find whatever the right course is, and the right things during their administration, but I wouldn't prejudge what that would be right now,\" Jones said. \"He's not the president of the United States right now, he's the president- elect. He's talking to a lot of people around the world and that's not necessarily a bad thing.\"\n\n Trump is the first president or president-elect to speak with a Taiwanese leader since the United States broke-off relations with Taiwan in 1979 under President Jimmy Carter, when his administration established formal relations with Beijing, marking the start of the one-China policy.\"\n\n \"I think the policy is fine,\" Jones said. \"I think we should lighten up a little bit about the importance of phone calls and signals that may or may not have been sent. I think policy is pretty stable and the Chinese relationship is very important.\"\n\n For the first time, China sent a pair of bombers capable of launching nuclear weapons to circle Taiwan, two US officials tell Fox News. The incident occurred November 26, less than a week before Trump's controversial call Friday with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, angering Chinese leaders who lodged a diplomatic protest the next day.\n\n Japan scrambled eight F-15 fighter jets to intercept the two Chinese H-6K bombers and their two escort planes at one point northeast of Taiwan, according to officials.\n\n Trump's response to critics of his phone call came in a tweet Friday.\n\n \"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.\"\n\n U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have totaled more than $46 billion since 1990. In December 2015, the United States, under President Obama, announced a $1.83 billion arms sales agreement with Taiwan, the first arms sale in four years.\n\n Critics were outraged that Trump had broken decades-long policy by speaking with Taiwan's president. When asked on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" Sunday if he thought Trump was speaking to the leader of a sovereign nation, Trump's future chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said, \"He knew exactly what was happening. But look, we have a lot of problems to solve in this country, and we're not going to solve them by just making believe that people don't exist. This is not a massive deviation of our policy.\"\n\n Since the Chinese civil war in the 1940s, China and Taiwan have been ruled separately. China claims sovereignty over the island.\n\n The White House was on the defensive Monday. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said officials had already made at least two calls to the Chinese.\n\n \"I can confirm that U.S. officials, including senior officials on the national security council, been in touch with their Chinese counterparts to reiterate our country's continued commitment to one-China policy,\" he said.\n\n Trade tariffs are another point of friction. China imposes a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, for instance, while the United States has either eliminated tariffs or charges two and a half percent or less for overseas products - a huge advantage for China.\n\n The flight around Taiwan consisted of two Chinese Xian H-6K bombers, along with two escort planes, a Tupolev Tu-154 and Shaanxi Y-8, flying around the island of Taiwan from mainland China, taking off and landing from two separate Chinese military bases.\n\n The escort jets were used to collect radar information and conduct other surveillance on American allies such as Japan, Fox News was told. The Chinese bombers stayed in international airspace, according to officials.\n\n At different points of the flight, Chinese J-10 and Su-30 fighter jets performed escort duties for the Chinese strategic bombers.\n\n \"China has steadily built up a massive military capability in the area around Taiwan. This isn't simply a matter of flying bombers. Understand that technically, we can't object to flying bombers near Taiwan if we are flying combat aircraft and reconnaissance aircraft near China. This is simply legal under international law,\" said Anthony H. Cordesman, the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"Taiwan faces a much more serious Chinese challenge than it has ever faced before.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nJennifer Griffin currently serves as a national security correspondent for FOX News Channel .

The two were charged with attempted murder and unlawful use of a weapon, police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson.

That is the work of four years,\" Hales added. \"Get involved. But don't come participate in a protest in downtown Portland that has been taken over the last three nights by people who simply want to fight with police.\"\n\nPortland was just one city that saw another night of protests. Tens of thousands of people marched in streets across the U.S. \u2013 including in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, and the smaller cities such as Worcester, Mass and Iowa City, Iowa.\n\nProtesters rallied at New York's Union Square before taking their cause up Fifth Avenue toward Trump Tower, where they were held back by police barricades.\n\nThe Republican president-elect was holed up inside his tower apartment, working with aides on the transition to the White House.\n\nDemonstrators in Indianapolis on Saturday threw rocks at police, slightly injuring two officers, said Police Chief Troy Riggs. Some protesters began chanting threats including \"Kill the Police,\" and officers moved in to arrest seven demonstrators.\n\nPolice briefly fired pepper balls into the crowd during the confrontation.\n\n\"We believe that we have some instigators that arrived in our city,\" trying to start a riot, Riggs said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, an estimated 8,000 people marched through downtown streets Saturday to condemn what they saw as Trump's hate speech about Muslims, pledge to deport people in the country illegally and crude comments about women.\n\nJennifer Cruz, 18, of Ventura, California, carried a sign that asked: \"Legalize weed but not my Mom?\" \u2014 a reference to Californians' Tuesday passage of a measure legalizing recreational marijuana use.\n\nCruz said her parents have been in the United States illegally for 30 years, although her mother has spent years seeking citizenship. She called the possibility of their deportation terrifying.\n\n\"We talk about it almost every day,\" she said. \"My Mom wants to leave it in the hands of God, but I'm not just going to sit back and not do anything. I'm going to fight for my parents, even if it kills me.\"\n\nIn other parts of the country, spirited demonstrations on college campuses and peaceful marches along downtown streets have taken place since Wednesday.\n\nEvening marches disrupted traffic in Miami and Atlanta.\n\nDemonstrations also took place internationally. A group of Mexicans at statue representing independence in Mexico City expressed their concerns about a possible wave of deportations. One school teacher said it would add to the \"unrest\" that's already in Mexico.\n\nAbout 300 people protested Trump's election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy near the landmark Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.\n\nPresident Barack Obama meets in Berlin next week with Chancellor Angela Merkel and several other European leaders, and is expected to confront global concerns about Trump's election.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.77419376373291, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 709, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.75048206268, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161113100000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.94922425952045, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/15/to-preview-trump-presidency-look-at-confirmation-hearings-for-his-cabinet-picks.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [674, 804, 948, 1111, 1524, 1787, 1892, 2033, 2195, 2197, 2223, 2247, 2337, 2475, 2564, 2685, 2826, 2948, 3012, 3077, 3175, 3427, 3586, 3631, 3675, 3756, 3831, 3920, 4056, 4157, 4272, 4359, 4634, 4770, 4885, 5066, 5185, 5242, 5387, 5508, 5637, 5713, 5736, 6009, 6091, 6092, 6242, 6388]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 901, "scraper_regex": 984}}, "headline": "To preview the Trump presidency, look at the confirmation hearings for his cabinet picks ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 984, "date": "20170115200000", "story_content": "Retired General James Mattis, President-elect Donald Trump's choice for Secretary of Defense, capped a series of head-turning confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill this week. \n\nEarly in the week, nominees presented a stark contrast to Senate Democrats. On one side, Americans saw well-prepared, highly dignified appointees appear before elected officials from both parties. On the other side, hostile questioners from the left grilled the nominees, almost reflexively manufacturing attacks on character and asserting gaps in knowledge \u2013 which, to a casual observer, seemed nonexistent.\u00a0 Half dozen nominees have been nothing \u2013 if not meticulously prepared. What does this portend for the coming Trump dministration?\u00a0\n\nFirst out of the box, Senator Jeff Sessions, nominee for Attorney General, and ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson, nominee for Secretary of State.\u00a0 \n\nNot far behind these two, Generals John Kelly (Homeland Security) and James Mattis (Defense). Their opening statements were cogent, if not at times compelling.\u00a0 \n\nRealism seemed to permeate, even about Russia, China and the long road back to domestic tranquility and global American leadership.\n\nBy contrast, a former comic turned Democrat Senator pressed the case for parsing words in questionnaires filed 30 years apart, accusing Senator Sessions first of over- and then by under-inclusion, taking issue with legal terms of which, by his own admission, he knows nothing.\u00a0 \n\nOther Senators knowingly took a dark interpretation of Senator Session's exemplary record on human and civil rights, countermanding the impassioned appeal by liberal Republican Susan Collins of Maine, who sought to preempt character assassination as a tactic.\u00a0 \n\nOne Senator even breached 200 years of tradition to breathlessly grandstand against Senator Sessions.\u00a0\n\nOthers tried to embarrass Rex Tillerson, who steadfastly maintained the dignity of the chamber, against an onslaught of leading questions.\u00a0 Drawn to do so, he demurred when prodded to speculate, decide hypothetical questions, make assumptions based on incomplete data, or declare policy on the spot. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSo, what are we seeing?\u00a0 And what does it mean?\u00a0 What does the solid performance of these appointees, against a shaky backdrop, foretell?\u00a0 \n\nFirst, these Trump appointees are demonstrating high respect for process and truth, something for which every American should be glad.\u00a0 \n\nSecond, we are learning something intangible about the future of this administration.\u00a0 Whether Democrats continue their stubborn resistance and inglorious slide, or choose to arrest it, is really secondary.\u00a0 \n\nPrimary is what we are learning about the quality of preparation, patience and temperament of those who will soon lead major departments.\u00a0\n\nThe unspoken message is heartening. The nominees are not newbies. Nor are they misaligned with their assigned missions.\u00a0 They are seasoned professionals. And they are acting that way.\u00a0 They are proving candid and deep, sensible, at times even sage.\u00a0 They know the ropes, their fields, the challenges that lie ahead of them \u2013 and respect Congress.\u00a0 Or at least that is the distinct impression they leave.\n\nCollectively, these early appointees have endured dozens of hours of leading questions, transparent attempts (largely unavailing) at character assassination, and attempts to derail their focus.\u00a0 \n\nThey have weathered the storm. All the while, Heartland Americans have watched the process, including these spasms of senatorial haughtiness, and wondered:\u00a0 Is there more to this team than we thought?\u00a0 Great depth, more decency, honor and hope?\u00a0\n\nThe tables have somehow begun to turn. Senate Democrats cannot digest reality.\u00a0 Exhaustive witness preparation and performance tells you what lies ahead.\u00a0\n\n Trump appointees have been rocks, displaying mettle, method, and the power of focus. \u00a0If this is how they all shake out, we know how the Trump Aaministration will conduct policy \u2013 they will go after -- and get -- results.\u00a0\n\n No wonder the media is evolving sooner than we thought, to grudging respect for these appointees.\u00a0\n\nHow could they not? The Trump cabinet is listening and learning, proving prepared for what lies only days ahead.\u00a0 \n\nBy all appearances, they are organizing for success, as reflected in the hearings. \u00a0\n\nPreliminary inquiries reveal how this team does business. \n\nSince the president-elect designated his future cabinet, nominees have conducted more than 300 meetings with Senators and staff, met with 87 of the 100 Senators, including 50 Republican Senators and 37 Democrats.\u00a0\n\nBehind closed doors, these nominees have reportedly tallied over 30 practice hearings, including 15 during the first week of January.\u00a0 \n\nBy one count, they have mastered complex binders, collectively answering 2,604 questions in practice sessions. \u00a0\n\nBroken down, they have responded to 120 questions per session, spent more than 70 hours in mock hearings, and fielded questions from 200 volunteers rotating through role playing.\u00a0 Something is afoot on the seven floors of the Trump Transition, at the old GSA Building on 18th and E. in Washington.\u00a0\n\nExtrapolate and you see where the Trump team is going.\u00a0 They take nothing for granted, do not jump to conclusions or assume knowledge. \n\nThey are about outcomes, even before the mission burdens them.\u00a0\n\n They are about self-control, self-awareness, self-discipline, and self-effacing presentation \u2013 in a word, leadership.\u00a0\n\nObviously, we are at a cross roads. We seem to be at the front end of a cone, widening to patient reform and promised results.\u00a0 The hearings suggest predictability and fidelity to process and principle.\u00a0 That is a good start.\u00a0\n\n In front of us, an amalgam of professionalism, purpose and patience, more like George Marshall and George Schultz than George Soros.\n\nAll this is promising. These hearings tell us more than we thought. They are demonstrating a top-shelf team, starting with preparation.\u00a0 \n\nThese appointees' performances are salutary \u2013 indicative of long term success.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nSenate Democrats may be out of touch, but these appointees have a grip. They strike average viewers as respectful and honest, capable and on task.\u00a0 \n\nThe contrast could not be more telling, encouraging, or head-turning. \n\nMay the cone open, and America again demonstrate its innate greatness.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRobert Charles is a former Assistant Secretary of State under George W.

That's a 30.7 percent reduction during the first three years of life.\n\nThe real benefit seemed to be exclusively among the children whose mothers started out with low levels of the two key ingredients in fish oil - eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). That may make them more vulnerable to the inflammation and heightened immune system response that is a factor in asthma and related conditions.\n\n\"If it weren't for the effects in that subgroup, then the results would have not been statistically significant,\" said Kathleen Melanson, a professor of nutrition sciences at the University of Rhode Island in Kingston, who was not involved in the research.\n\nAmong the Danish women with low EPA and DHA levels, the rate of asthma and wheezing in their children was 17.5 percent when the women took fish oil during pregnancy versus 34.1 percent when they took the placebo oil.\n\nOne in five young children are affected by asthma and wheezing disorders. In recent decades, the rate has more than doubled in Western countries. Previous research has shown that those conditions are more prevalent among babies whose mothers have low levels of fish oil in their bodies. The new large-scale test, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine, is the first to see if supplements can actually lower the risk.\n\nWomen can eat fish to get the same benefit but \"you really need to be very fond of fish to get sufficient amounts through your diet\" to have the effect seen in the study, chief author Dr. Hans Bisgaard of the University of Copenhagen told Reuters Health in an email.\n\nThe findings must be tested in other parts of the world, where fish oil consumption is lower.\n\nThat concern is echoed in an editorial in the journal by Dr. Christopher Ramsden of the National Institute on Aging, who said the 2.4 gram dose \"was approximately 15 to 20 times as high as the average U.S. intake from foods.\"\n\n\"Before these findings can be applied to clinical practice, it is therefore imperative to ensure that this dose had no adverse effects on behavior, cognition, or other long-term outcomes,\" he said. \"Future work is also needed to determine whether lower doses are effective and whether these results can be replicated in other populations.\"\n\nMelanson told Reuters Health by phone that the dose used in the study was very high. The World Health Organization recommends no more than 3 grams per day, in part because excessive amounts can increase the risk of bleeding, lower blood pressure, and interact with medicines or vitamins A, D and E.\n\n\"Too much of a good thing is never a good thing,\" she said.\n\n\"It is possible that a lower dose would have sufficed,\" the Bisgaard team said.\n\nFish oil supplementation also lowered babies' risk of lower respiratory tract infections, with the rate going from 39.1 percent with olive oil placebo to 31.7 percent with fish oil.\n\nBut the supplements didn't seem to affect the odds of a baby or toddler developing the skin condition eczema, or an allergy such as a reaction to milk or egg products, or a severe asthma attack.\n\nThe women began taking the fish oil and olive oil capsules at the 24th week of pregnancy and continued until one week after delivery.\n\nThe researchers calculated that 14.6 women would need to be treated to prevent one case of asthma or persistent wheeze.

He revealed once and for all that it's an ideology based on a flawed view of reality and of human nature, and that it has been a destructive force in our country going back to the New Deal, and going forward to ObamaCare.\n\nObama exposed the bankruptcy of the mainstream media and its bogus claims to be an objective information filter, when, in fact, outlets like CNN, NBC and the New York Times are mouthpieces for the Democratic Party.\n\nHe exposed the political bankruptcy of the so-called civil rights movement and groups like Black Lives Matter and showed that, instead of trying to improve the lives of African-Americans, they are geared to raise racial tensions for political gain.\n\nHe exposed the bankruptcy of Keynesian economics. After eight years of trying to use government borrowing and spending to grow the economy, Obama and his advisers have left us poorer, less competitive and with more adult Americans not working than at any time since the days of malaise in the 1970s.\n\nFour years weren't enough to expose these truths. It actually took eight years and Obama's reelection in 2012 to fully reveal the lies, deceptions and fallacies on which his presidency was based.\n\nEight years for him to hollow out the Democratic Party at the national and state levels, so that Trump enters the White House with a Republican majority in both houses of Congress and with only four states out of 50 with Democratic governors and Democratic majority legislatures. The Democratic national leadership has been reduced to a politburo of septuagenarians and refugees from the SDS.\n\nIn the perpetual divide between liberalism and conservatism, Obama has shown us which is on the side of law and order, and which is not.\u00a0 He showed us side which cares about our veterans, and which does not.\n\nHe showed which supports our allies like Britain, Japan and Israel, and which does not.\n\nHe showed which side cares about national security, and which does not \u2014 and which feels free to let a traitor like Chelsea Manning go free.\n\nHe showed which is more concerned about protecting terrorists from Americans, including springing them from Gitmo, than protecting Americans from terrorists.\n\nHe showed the American people that federal agencies like the IRS, EPA and CIA have become politicized to a degree that makes them ineffective and even hostile to American interests.\n\nHe showed this nation and the world that appeasement of our foes, like China, Russia and Iran, doesn't work, and that when America fails to lead, we are all put in peril \u2014 not only the people of Iraq and Syria and Europe, but the relatives of those who were massacred in a nightclub in Orlando, Fla.\n\nFinally, after eight years in office, Barack Obama has left official Washington broken, exhausted and paralyzed by partisan rancor. Even Washington now recognizes it's time for new blood and new ideas, and that whatever happens it's bound to be better than what we've suffered since 2009.\n\nAll in all, it's an opening for our new president like none since Ronald Reagan, or even going back to 1829 and the inauguration of Andrew Jackson.\n\nAnd let's face it. After eight years of Obama, Donald Trump has nowhere to go but up.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHistorian Arthur Herman is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institutein Washington, D.C.

Authorities don't know why he chose his target and have not ruled out\u00a0terrorism.\n\nTerrorism\u00a0may have been a \"potential motivation\" for the attack on Friday that\u00a0killed five people,\u00a0Special Agent in Charge\u00a0George Piro said during a\u00a0news conference.\n\n\nLater in the afternoon, police in Alaska said they had returned a handgun to the Florida airport shooting suspect which was temporarily taken from him when he underwent a mental evaluation late last year, according to a Reuters report.\n\nAnchorage Police Chief Christopher Tolley said it was not immediately clear if it was the same gun used in Friday's deadly rampage. Officials told a news conference the gun was returned to the suspect because the Iraq war veteran had not committed a crime.\n\nWhy the gunman may have chosen South Florida was unclear. He had no clear connection to the state aside from relatives in the Naples area, a two-hour drive away, the\u00a0Sun Sentinel reported.\n\nVIDEO: SEN. RUBIO REACTS TO AIRPORT SHOOTING\u00a0\n\nThe suspected shooter had a history of mental health problems -- some of which followed his military service in Iraq -- and was receiving psychological treatment at his home in Alaska, his relatives said.\n\nFBI investigators questioned Santiago for hours. Piro said investigators were scouring the 26-year-old suspect's social media footprint and looking into where he'd traveled before.\n\nSantiago was not on any no-fly list, according to the FBI. He allegedly carried out the attack with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, Piro added.\n\nFT. LAUDERDALE SHOOTING SUSPECT SAID HE WAS FORCED TO WATCH ISIS VIDEOS\n\nBroward County Sheriff\u00a0Scott\u00a0Israel said six people were wounded in the attack -- not eight, as officials had said Friday. Three were in the intensive care unit and three were in good condition, Israel told reporters.\n\n\"Only thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn't feeling too good,\" Santiago's uncle, Hernan Rivera,\u00a0told The Record newspaper.\n\nSantiago deployed in 2010 as part of the Puerto Rico National Guard, spending a year with an engineering battalion, according to Guard spokesman Maj. Paul Dahlen.\n\nIn recent years, Santiago -- a new dad, family said -- had been living in Anchorage, Alaska, his brother, Bryan Santiago, told The Associated Press from Puerto Rico. Bryan Santiago said his brother's girlfriend had recently called the family to alert them to his treatment.\n\nIn November, Esteban told FBI agents in Alaska that the government was controlling his mind and was forcing him to watch Islamic State group videos, a law enforcement official said. The official was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation by name and spoke Friday on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe FBI agents notified the police after the interview with Esteban Santiago, who took him in for a mental health evaluation.\n\nBryan Santiago said his brother never spoke to him directly about his medical issues.\n\n\"We have not talked for the past three weeks,\" Bryan Santiago said. \"That's a bit unusual ... I'm in shock. He was a serious person ... He was a normal person.\"\n\nEsteban Santiago was born in New Jersey but moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2, his brother said. He grew up in the southern coastal town of Penuelas before joining the Guard in 2007.\n\nFormer neighbor Ursula Candelario recalled seeing Esteban Santiago grow up and said people used to salute him after he joined the Guard. \"He was very peaceful, very educated, very serious,\" she said. \"We're in shock. I couldn't believe it,\" said Candelario.\n\nWhile in Iraq, Santiago cleared roads of improvised explosive devices and at least two members of his company were killed, spokesman Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead told The New York Times. He was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation.\n\nSince returning from Iraq, Santiago served in the Army Reserves and the Alaska National Guard in Anchorage, Olmstead told the AP. He was serving as a combat engineer in the Guard before his discharge for \"unsatisfactory performance,\" said Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, a spokeswoman. His military rank upon discharge was E3, private 1st class, and he worked one weekend a month with an additional 15 days of training yearly, Olmstead said.\n\nShe would not elaborate on his discharge, but the Pentagon said he went AWOL several times and was demoted and discharged.\n\nStill, he'd had some successes during his military career, being awarded a number of medals and commendations including the Iraq Campaign Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.\n\nHis uncle and aunt in New Jersey were trying to make sense of what they were hearing about Santiago after his arrest at the Fort Lauderdale airport. \u00a0FBI agents arrived at their house to question them, and reporters swarmed around.\n\nMaria Ruiz told The Record that her nephew had recently become a father to a son and was struggling.\n\n\"It was like he lost his mind,\" she said in Spanish of his return from Iraq. \"He said he saw things.\"\n\nSantiago was flying from Anchorage on a Delta flight and had checked only one piece of luggage, which contained the gun.\n\nSantiago was charged in a domestic violence case in January 2016, damaging a door when he forced his way into a bathroom at his girlfriend's Anchorage home. The woman told officers he yelled at her to leave, choked her and smacked her on the side of the head, according to charging documents.\n\nA month later municipal prosecutors said he violated the conditions of his release when officers found him at her home during a routine check. He told police he had lived there since he was released from custody the previous month. His Anchorage attorney, Max Holmquist, declined to discuss his client.\n\nLaw enforcement officers were at the girlfriend's home Friday afternoon, and officers guarding the property outside told a reporter who approached the home to step away.\n\nSenator-elect Nelson Cruz, who knew the family and represents the town where they live in Puerto Rico, said he had been talking regularly with Bryan Santiago since the shooting.\n\n\"They're very humble and very Christian people,\" Cruz said of Esteban Santiago's brother and mother. \"They want to tell the families of the victims that they're extremely saddened and extremely upset by what happened.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.285962104797361, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1098, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 14, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.67872643154, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 50, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170108120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.55373406193078, "mft_mean": 4.54545454545}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/15/academics-race-to-save-rare-colonial-documents-in-cuba.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [63]}}, "headline": "Academics race to save rare colonial documents in Cuba", "wordcount_as_scraped": 887, "date": "20170116060000", "story_content": "HAVANA \u2013 \u00a0An American team of academics is racing to preserve millions of Cuban historical documents before they are lost to the elements and poor storage conditions.\n\nMany of the documents shed light on the slave trade, an integral part of Cuba's colonial history that was intertwined with that of the United States.\n\nDavid Lafevor, a history professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, and his brother Matthew, a geography professor at the University of Alabama, have worked since 2005 to make computer copies of millions of documents mouldering in damp storage spaces on the island.\n\nTheir latest project is a partnership between the British Library Foundation and Vanderbilt University to capture almost 2 million documents in digital form, a treasure trove stretching back to the mid-16th century of documents about early island life and the slave trade.\n\nDavid Lafevor said there is nothing like Cuba's documents in the U.S., where slaves were considered possessions, not human beings.\n\nThough no less ruthless when it came to slavery than the Anglos to the north, the Spanish recognized the \"personhood\" of slaves once they were baptized into the Catholic Church. Their births, marital status, national origin and deaths were all duly recorded in the town records and stored in church archives, leaving a historical record of blacks and the lives they led unique in the Americas.\n\nChurches became the repository of much of this history because of its central role in island life and because church officials were painstaking documentarians who often were the most educated in their communities, David Lafevor said in an interview.\n\n\"The documents are not only pertinent to the Catholic Church because the church was often the most substantial building in town, so other documents were kept there as well,\" he said.\n\nFor instance, while digitizing some documents in the town of Colon, a slave trading post in colonial days that is about 175 kilometers (about 110 miles) east of Havana, Lafevor discovered the existence of a nearby town founded by former American slaves who had fled the mainland from what had been Spanish-ruled Florida.\n\nThe town, Ceiba Mocha, was once known as Ceiba Mocha de la Nueva St. Augustine, a reference to the city that was the capital of Spanish Florida in the 18th century. None of the town's residents were aware of its origins.\n\nCuba's Catholic Church has played a major role in the preservation project, granting access to church archives around the island and assisting in identifying important documents.\n\nChurch officials like Deacon Felix Knight of the colonial Santo Espirito Church in Old Havana, tucked away in a warren of narrow lanes in the city's colonial heart, work with the academics to find and preserve old documents.\n\n\"These books reflect life, aspects of the sacramental life of blacks, obviously of whites also. That's how these books where placed \u2014 books for whites, books for blacks. The important thing is to preserve as many of them as possible,\" Knight said.\n\nIt is especially important to preserve the history of the Afro-Cuban community, whose history has not been well documented in Cuba, he added.\n\nSlavery wasn't outlawed in Cuba until 1886, and American slavers had used the island as a transshipment point for African slaves destined for U.S. slave markets in the South.\n\n\"We are working for that, to maintain and recover that which is irreplaceable, a legacy. It's a patrimony, a way of seeing that is very personal,\" Knight said, holding a book from 1674 that contains records of black births, marriages, deaths and civil status.\n\nThe process of digitizing the papers can be painstaking, consisting of carefully removing the ancient volumes from storage, placing them on a black cloth used for background, then opening each page slowly and photographing it. An average book can contain hundreds of pages, all in various conditions of decay, the writing faded from age and the elements.\n\nThe leather-bound volumes are remarkably resistant to decay, considering many are stored in wooden cabinets in places with little climate control. Knight says churches were built in the colonial era to maximize air flow in the heavy tropical climate. High ceilings and thick walls kept the interiors of the churches cool and dry, helping to preserve the paper and leather-bound records.\n\nCheaper travel and more choices for accommodations have made the recovery project easier, Lafevor said, referring to a normalization process begun by the Obama administration two years ago. The Tennessee-based team can now fly directly to the island from the U.S., avoiding expensive third-country travel. But even more important, Lafevor said, the growth of \"casa particulares,\" the private homes that rent rooms to visitors, gives them more and cheaper choices for places to stay, allowing them to work for a month at a time.\n\nLafevor said no one knows how many millions of documents exist in storage, nor how many have been lost to storms, pirate attacks, war and civil unrest, but the project seeks to preserve as many as possible before more are lost to history. He said the current project will run until 2018 and hopes to digitize almost 2 million documents in four cities around the island.\n\nStill, he cautioned, the project is only a small step toward preserving a vibrant historical record, with millions of more documents spanning 500 years left to preserve around the island.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.2889366149902302, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 849, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.843694065449999, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 19, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 42, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170116060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.9469964664310995, "mft_mean": 3.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/02/vegetarian-and-vegan-diets-good-for-kids-and-adults-nutritionists-say.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 531, "scraper_regex": 596}}, "headline": "Vegetarian and vegan diets good for kids and adults, nutritionists say", "wordcount_as_scraped": 596, "date": "20161202150000", "story_content": "Plant-based diets are tied to a lower risk of health problems like heart disease, diabetes, obesity and certain cancers - and pretty much anyone can eat this way, according to a leading group of nutritionists.\n\nVegetarian and vegan diets are appropriate for all stages of life, including during infancy, pregnancy, childhood, adolescence and old age, the authors write in a position statement from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nThat's because people who adopt a plant-based diet tend to consume more fruits and vegetables, fewer sweets and salty snacks, and smaller amounts of total and saturated fats, the statement, published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, asserts.\n\nThe trick is to make sure these diets are well planned out and well balanced, said Vandana Sheth, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\n\"Any diet that is not well planned and balanced can have negative side effects,\" Sheth said by email.\n\n\"Just because foods are plant based doesn't automatically make them healthy,\" Sheth added. \"For instance, pastries, cookies, fried and salty foods may be vegan but don't really provide much in terms of nutritional value.\"\n\nFor younger vegetarians and vegans in particular, it's important to plan meals that include enough iron, zinc, vitamin B-12, and for some, calcium and vitamin D, Sheth said.\n\n\"Well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets containing vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds can be nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of some chronic diseases,\" Sheth noted.\n\nApproximately 3.3 percent of American adults are vegetarian or vegan, meaning they never eat meat, poultry or fish, according to the guidelines. This way of eating is much more common among younger adults than elderly people.\n\nAmong the health benefits noted in the guidelines, people who eat a plant-based diet are less likely to be overweight or obese than adults who consume meat.\n\nVegan diets in particular, which exclude meats as well as animal products like milk, eggs and honey, are associated with a lower risk of heart disease than other ways of eating, the statement also points out.\n\nAccording to the authors, people who adopt a vegan diet reduce the risk of diabetes by 62 percent, the risk of prostate cancer by 35 percent, the chance of being hospitalized for a heart attack by 33 percent, the risk of heart disease by 29 percent and the risk of all forms of cancer by 18 percent.\n\n\"People who adopt vegetarian diets have a lower body mass index, better control of blood pressure and blood glucose, less inflammation and lower cholesterol levels compared with non-vegetarians,\" Sheth said.\n\nJust because a diet is vegetarian or vegan, however, doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy, cautioned Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston.\n\n\"For instance, fries and a coke are vegan,\" Mozaffarian, who wasn't involved in the position statement, said by email.\n\n\"Indeed, much of the harmful stuff in the food supply is vegetarian or vegan: refined grains, starches, added sugars, sweets, trans fats, salt, etc,\" Mozaffarian added. \"People can have a vegetarian or vegan diet that is healthy or terrible; and a non-vegetarian or non-vegan diet that is healthy or terrible.\"\n\nA healthy diet is rich in minimally processed foods, especially from plants, but also from animals, Mozaffarian said.\n\n\"I recommend a high-fat Mediterranean-style diet, rich in fruits, non-starchy veggies, nuts, beans, fish, whole grains, and vegetable oils; and including yogurt, cheese, poultry, and occasional half serving a week of fresh, unprocessed red meat,\" Mozaffarian said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.71875, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 531, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.1354541815299999, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 4, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202150000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.5781544256120497, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/25/family-is-born.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [460, 693, 1385, 1683, 1685, 1963, 3169, 4062, 4714, 8162]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1406, "scraper_regex": 1562}}, "headline": "A family is born", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1562, "date": "20161125160000", "story_content": "We've all seen pictures of the sweet hospital scenes where dads hold their newborn babies for the first time.

He's had a good life, but there was one unfulfilled dream: he wanted to be a dad.\u00a0\n\nHe'd always known that he wanted to adopt rather than have biological children. He says, \"There's a lot of crazy in my family and I didn't want to risk passing it on. I didn't feel the need when there are children who need homes.\"\u00a0\n\nIn November of 2014, he'd dated one of the most perfect women he'd ever met, but it didn't work out. The next week at church a 14-year-old boy got up and talked about how his parents had abandoned him and how he now had a new home. For four weeks in a row, nudges about adopting arrived either in a book Cecil was reading or at church or through a friend.\n\nWith no wife in sight, Cecil decided to move ahead as a single adoptive dad. He'd never felt such peace about a decision. By January, he'd started a seven-week class with the Department of Social Services. He switched to the Children's Home Society to get his license to be a foster parent, the step required before he could adopt. \u00a0\n\nThe process continued with a physical, and an inspection of his home by the fire marshal. Cecil painted, bought bunk beds so he could house multiple children, and stocked his home with the gifts provided at two showers thrown by friends. And on July 22, 2015, the long-awaited approval arrived. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nOn Aug. 3, he got an email from his social worker, a mass email that said, \"We have an 8-year-old who needs emergency placement.\" The boy had been taken from his home when he was five. In the three years since then, he'd been in ten foster homes and eight different schools. \u00a0\n\nCecil says, \"When I read his story, and I learned about his birth parents, and his siblings that had already been adopted, something in me just jumped up to fight for him. I told my social worker I wanted him, but my request was denied. The child's last two placements had been with single dads who'd planned to adopt him, but both men had returned him at the ten-week mark. The county didn't want to risk that again, but I knew he was mine.\"\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Cecil asked his social worker if he could write the county a letter. In all her years there, she'd never heard of that before, but she said she'd deliver it. Cecil says, \"I wrote about my plan for his education, how I'd help him grow up without labels, and that I would fight for him like no one ever had. And I ended the letter mentioning that I already had his shark sheets waiting for him, because on his form it had said that he liked sharks. I knew he was going to be mine.\"\n\nThey read the letter and had Cecil come for an interview the next day. They approved the request after the interview, and his son, Boone, came to live with Cecil on Thursday night, August 6, at 5:15. It was a moment that would change two lives forever. \u00a0\n\nCecil will never forget the first time he saw his son. \"I was shocked at how cute and how little he was. They walked in the door and his social worker said to him, 'You two have something in common. You both think you're the best huggers in the world.' We laughed and I asked if I could give him a hug. He said yes. I hugged him tight and swung him around the room.\n\nWhen I put him down, he said, 'You win. Nobody's ever hugged me like that before.'\" Boone later told Cecil that he knew at that moment that he finally had a dad.\n\nIt was surreal when Cecil saw his son for the first time. \"I knew he was mine and that I was committed to him for the rest of his life, but I had no idea what to expect. In foster care classes, they give you the worst case scenarios of what these children have been through, and Boone had been through some traumatic situations. I just wanted him to be happy.\"\u00a0\n\nThe next two weeks were hectic as they got Boone registered for school, bought clothing, shoes, and new toys, and as Boone met the people in Cecil's life.\n\nThose first weeks were a learning curve for Cecil, days filled with numerous discoveries. One surprise was that his son is so much like him. They enjoy the same things\u2014socializing, old cartoons, Legos, and telling stories.\n\nThen there were the challenges. Because Boone had moved through so many schools, he was behind educationally. The years with his birth family were filled with neglect and emotional abuse, leaving him with anxieties, fears that impacted his ability to sleep each night. \u00a0\n\nBut there has also been much laughter, and many of their memories were documented in Cecil's daily Facebook posts that started \"Parenting an 8-year-old, Day __.\" One of the funniest was on day 5 after Boone's arrival. It read, \"My child knows how to play by himself. Why did someone not tell me that on day one?\"\n\nAnd on Day 17, \"I think my child has amnesia. Every morning when we wake up, he has forgotten who is in charge.\"\n\nAlong with the laughter, though, there have been many poignant moments. One night Cecil was sitting on his son's bed saying good-night when Boone said, \"I came into this house with a broken heart, and I don't know why, but I think you had one too. Now we have a whole heart.\"\n\nOn another day Cecil asked Boone, \"Don't you love coming home after the cleaning lady has been here? The house is so clean.\"\n\nBoone's reply? \"I just love coming home.\"\n\nHaving a home and a dad has changed Boone. It's all captured in his smile. Cecil says, \"I was given his life book. It probably only had 15 pictures in it of his first eight years\u2014and he wasn't smiling in a single picture in a single home. Getting to see that smile now lets me know I've made a difference.\"\n\nCecil summed it up in one of his Facebook posts, \"I love to hear my son singing. Not just because he is good at it, but because unhappy children don't sing.\"\n\nWhen asked what is most special to him about Boone, Cecil says, \"I love his strength. For him to have gone through his birth childhood and ten foster homes and to be so resilient and so innocent and full of hope and kindness at this age is remarkable. I'm also proud because every time we get a call to provide respite for a foster child, regardless of what we have planned that we may have to cancel, he always says, 'Daddy, we have to help the kids.' He's never allowed me to say no to a temporary placement, because he knows where they've been.\"\n\nTo others who are considering adoption, Cecil says, \"To be able to give a child a permanent loving home is a gift. There's nothing greater that you could do for a stranger.\"\n\nFor those who are interested in foster care, he says, \"We're called to take care of these children, and if we don't, then we should be ashamed, because we live in a society of empty bedrooms. The majority of people who meet me or hear my story have an empty bedroom in their house, and I think that's wrong when you have an empty bedroom and a child doesn't have a home.\"\n\nSo what's next for Cecil? \"We pray every night for Boone's brother who's on the way. We think he's between 5-8 years old. We hope to have him in the next 3-6 months. And then we plan for another brother after that. Over the next twenty years, I want to have 5-7 children.\"\n\nA man who didn't have a son is now a dad, and a little boy who desperately wanted a dad now has one. And friends and family who dote on him. And the security of a forever home where he will always be wanted and loved.\n\nBecause of a decision to adopt, two lives have been permanently changed. A family was born. And a little boy who once had to fight to make it through every day no longer has to worry about that\u2014because now he has a dad who will fight those battles for him.\n\nNovember is National Adoption Awareness Month. Could you open your heart to a child who needs a home? One of the best gifts a child will ever receive is someone who loves him and is involved in his life every day. Just ask a little boy named Boone Stokes.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMichelle Cox'is the award-winning bestselling author of \"Just 18 Summers\" (Tyndale House Publishers, Inc., April 1, 2014) and (releasing fall 2016) \"God Glimpses from the Jewelry Box\" and \"God Glimpses from the Toolbox.\" Visit her at www.just18summers.com.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.03406322002411, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1406, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.4629485789400003, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161125160000, "PurityVirtue": 5, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 1.9203413940256, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/24/bundle-up-and-get-outdoors-health-benefits-outdoor-winter-play-for-kids.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [539]}}, "headline": "Bundle up and get outdoors: The health benefits of outdoor winter play for kids", "wordcount_as_scraped": 601, "date": "20161224120000", "story_content": "As winter and cold weather approaches, children's play is often limited to the indoors. Adult fears about safety and negative attitudes toward exposure to cold weather are the barriers that prevent children from accessing play in winter months. It is common to hear adults say that \"my child will not like being in the cold weather,\" or \"the cold is too dangerous to play in,\" or \"there's nothing to play with.\" It is up to adults to focus on the importance of\u00a0children's play, regardless of the season. After all, play should not be restricted to warm weather. Let's welcome this upcoming winter season with a playful attitude.\n\nWhen the weather drops into the single digits, it is common for parents to want their children to stay indoors to play. Before you go and curse the cold weather for keeping your playful children indoors all winter, let's consider all of the benefits that cold weather has when it comes to children's health, development, and well-being.\n\nDuring the summer months, children become used to the warm, green climate that the season has to offer. After the change in season or the first snowfall, children view their environment through a different lens: fallen leaves, brown grass, snow, ice. This new lens enables them to imagine the outdoors differently and to be creative and play in different ways.\n\nThe winter months provide us with different ways of moving our bodies, such as sledding, walking up a snow hill, or building a snowman. Our larger muscles are put to great use in the winter months due to the challenges that snow provides. This large-muscle use and increase in physical activity support children's gross motor development and overall health.\n\nMost adults associate the winter months with getting colds and illnesses such as the flu. However, it is not the cold weather that necessarily causes colds and flus \u2013 it is increased exposure to indoor environments where bacteria and viruses live. For example, during the winter months, you turn on your home's heating and venting systems. The bacteria and viruses within your home are continuously being moved around inside. Adults and children who spend long periods of time in a heated and poorly ventilated home, without exposure to fresh air, can easily pass germs to each other.\n\nWeather that we consider \"messy\" provides environments and materials that are inspiring and fun for children; for example, patches of ice, large snow hills, and trees covered in snow. These environments provide children with opportunities for new challenges, such as sliding down the ice patch and climbing a snow hill. Engagement with outdoor environments in the winter provokes new problem-solving skills \u2013 \"How can I slide down this ice patch without falling?\" \"How fast can I run up this snow hill?\" \"Can I climb this tree using a branch as a snow pick?\" The ever-changing environments that the winter months have to offer provide children with the challenges that they so often crave.\n\nWhen we stay indoors during the winter, we are not only missing out on play, but also on necessary vitamins that the outdoor environment gives us. Children get vitamin D through sun exposure, and absorb it even though the sun is not as warm in the winter. Vitamin D helps regulate mental and emotional moods, doing so by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin plays an important role in regulating mood and keeping us happy. So the more exposure you have to the sun, the higher your serotonin levels will be. It is recommended that you get at least half an hour of playtime outdoors in the winter.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.138312593102455, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 620, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.15708382376, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 5, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161224120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.806451612903226, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.45454545454499995}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/07/trump-twitter-president-social-media-gives-him-tweet-revenge.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2327, 2336, 3108, 3124, 3628, 3643, 3735, 4657]}}, "headline": "Trump the Twitter president: Social media gives him tweet revenge", "wordcount_as_scraped": 762, "date": "20161207160000", "story_content": "Newly-elected President Donald Trump will soon take the helm of the world's most-powerful job. He'll command an expansive nuclear arsenal, an unparalleled military and a Twitter account with 16.9 million followers.\n\nThat last item gives Trump the unique ability to go around the major media. It makes him a one-man super power \u2013 able to push policy agendas, compliment allies and critique the press.\n\nThe American media are terrified of Trump. They are freaked out by his ability to talk directly to the American public.\n\nEven more, they are enraged over his willingness to attack them \u2013 the people who think they are \"truth tellers.\"\n\nIn slightly less than a month since the election, Trump has already passed the benchmark of the first 100 Tweets of his new administration. More than one-fourth of those more than 100 tweets has criticized the biased media.\n\nTrump has blasted the \"failing\" New York Times 10 times, and knocked \"one-sided, biased\" \"Saturday Night Live\" and the \"highly overrated\" play \"Hamilton.\"\n\nAccording to Socialbakers.com Trump's followers have skyrocketed since the election, from roughly 13 million followers to nearly 17 million.\n\nMonday, he aimed his tweets in a full broadside at the traditional news media:\n\n\"If the press would cover me accurately & honorably, I would have far less reason to \"tweet.\" Sadly, I don't know if that will ever happen!\" he wrote.\n\nTrump had told \"60 Minutes\" that he would cut back on Twitter as president just days after the election. \"I'm going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to be very restrained,\" he explained to correspondent Lesley Stahl.\n\nThat appearance was cited by CBS News on Monday night. But they seem to have forgotten what else he said during the earlier interview. \"I have a method of fighting back,\" he added.\n\nHe's right. And he needs it to even the odds against the press that is still campaigning against him.\n\nTrump's tweets have been widely criticized in the media, including on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Liberal actor Alec Baldwin mocked Trump in the skit saying his \"brain is bad,\" explained Townhall. \"'I just retweeted the best tweet. I mean, wow, what a great, smart tweet,' Baldwin says after sharing a 16-year-old high schooler's tweet -- which actually\u00a0happened\u00a0last month.\" \"The View's\" Whoopi Goldberg urged simply: \"\"Stay off Twitter and do your job now.\"\n\nSo-called journalists are just as bad. CNN's Chris Cuomo admitted to Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway the press is \"distracted from a little bit of analysis of the cabinet by the tweeting once again.\" Cuomo listed a few of the topics Trump had targeted on Twitter and asked her, \"Is this really how he's going to spend his time as president?\"\n\nThe Times ended up confused, wondering, \"If Trump Tweets It, Is It News? A Quandary for the News Media.\" The news organization that has 32 million followers on Twitter, isn't sure if Twitter is a legitimate form of communication?! The paper inadvertently made Trump's case for using Twitter, amidst its internal angst: \"Mr. Trump's\u00a0Twitter account\u00a0\u2014 a bully pulpit, propaganda weapon and attention magnet all rolled into one \u2014 has quickly emerged as a fresh journalistic challenge and a source of lively debate.\"\n\nThe Times quoted liberal Nation editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel urging news outlets to limit covering what Trump said. \"Media would be wise to stop hyper-coverage of Trump's tweets \u2014 they distract, distort and debase,\" she whined.\n\nNot everyone agrees that Twitter is bad, even on the left. White House Press Sec. Josh Earnest\u00a0told reporters\u00a0defended Trump's use of Twitter \"President Obama has found Twitter to be a useful mechanism\u00a0for communicating with the American public and providing some insight to all of you about what he's thinking about,\" he told the press corps.\n\nWhat many in the left and the news media don't seem to understand is that Trump is doing his job.\n\nFormer vice president Dick Cheney gets it. He told a defense forum recently that Twitter is \"sort of a way around the press.\" Cheney added: \"He's at the point where we don't need you guys anymore.\"\n\nAnd that's what really scares journalists. That he doesn't need them. Why deal with an activist, left-wing news media that is continuing its campaign against him?\n\nNancy Reagan became famous for the slogan, \"Just say no.\" In Trump terms, that should become: \"Just tweet no.\"\n\n\n\nDan Gainor is the Media Research Center's Vice President for Business and Culture.

They were also believed to be newly displaced from the government onslaught on the northern parts of eastern Aleppo.\n\nMeanwhile, eight civilians, including two children, were killed in shelling on the government-held western side of the city, according to state media. The government blamed rebels for the attack.\n\nThe embattled opposition fighters clashed heavily on the southern edge of the enclave with government-allied troops, who made new gains in the government offensive that has cleaved the rebel-held part of the city.\n\nThe Syrian government pushed its way into the 17-square mile rebel-held enclave over the weekend, making its first territorial gain in the area seized by the opposition fighters since 2012.\n\nGovernment officials say they want to \"liberate\" the area, calling the opposition fighters \"terrorists\", and accusing them of holding civilians there hostage.\n\nDespite opening a number of passageways to allow civilians to leave before the offensive, none of the residents took advantage of it, citing fears of being arrested or forcibly conscripted. The passageways were not U.N. supervised.\n\nIn New York on Wednesday, Syria's U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari accused the rebels of opening fire on the civilians as they tried to flee eastern Aleppo.\n\nThe bodies of the victims of the Jub al-Quba attack Wednesday lined the streets, as their bags and few belongings lied close by their sides, photos showed.\n\nJawad al-Rifai, who took the pictures for the Aleppo Media Center, said they were civilians \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 fleeing shelling and air strikes on other parts of the city.\n\n\"They were fleeing on foot. They were coming to our side,\" said Ibrahim Al-Haj, a member of the Syrian Civil Defense teams, explaining that the displaced were heading to what they thought was safer ground. \"There were children, baby bottles and bags all over.\"\n\nThe neighborhood and others around it in Aleppo's centrally-located old city have absorbed thousands of residents displaced by the advance of government troops in the east.\n\nAbdulkafi Alhamdo, a teacher living in the Zabadieh neighborhood in eastern Aleppo, said refugees were filling up his building, most of its flats abandoned because of the war. They had close to nothing, he said, and have asked for the simplest things, including salt.\n\n\"They knock on my door all the time. They ask for a plate, or some sheets,\" Alhamdo said.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war in Syria through a network of local contacts, said tens more were wounded in Jub al-Quba.\n\nObservatory chief Rami Abdurrahman said he predicts death tolls will rise in east Aleppo as the internal displacement creates more residential density.\n\nThe SCD in eastern Aleppo, also known as the White Helmets, put the toll at 45 killed. It blamed the government for the strikes.\n\nRescue efforts by the group were hampered by the lack of functioning machinery, said Rifai.\n\n\"Most of their equipment is out of service because of the targeting against their quarters,\" he added.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been displaced in Aleppo as pro-government Syrian forces press on with their campaign to reclaim the divided city.\n\nThe Observatory said more than 50,000 out of an estimated quarter-million inhabitants have been displaced by attacks on rebel-held eastern Aleppo over the past 4 days. Many of them fled to safer ground in areas under government or Kurdish control. The International Committee of the Red Cross says around 20,000 people have fled.\n\nThe Lebanese Al-Manar TV channel, operated by Hezbollah which has groups fighting on the government side in Syria, reported from the Aleppo countryside that pro-government forces were advancing in the southern portion of the city's rebel enclave.\n\nSyrian state media announced midday Wednesday that its forces had retaken the southern Sheikh Saeed neighborhood, while the Observatory said rebels still held onto a third of the area. The Observatory added that Iraqi militia fighters were playing a central role in the government's advance from the south.\n\nYasser al-Youssef, a spokesman for rebel group Nour el-Din el-Zinki, said the pro-government fighters were repelled and the opposition had captured at least one of their soldiers. The group posted a video of the captured fighter.\n\n\"There is regime deployment on the southern edge of the city. They are likely to attempt an assault on the southern front,\" al-Youssef said.\n\nResidents said meanwhile that after the killing in Jub al-Qubba, there was a respite in government bombing, most likely due to heavy rain.\n\n\"The rain stopped the bombing,\" al-Haj said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 5, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.46268653869629, "HarmVice": 20, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 802, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.4666532285, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 39, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161130230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.54545454545, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 4.8628428927680805, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/02/mom-missing-boy-in-hawaii-pleads-guilty-to-manslaughter-nearly-20-years-after-his-disappearance.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [110]}}, "headline": "Mom of missing boy in Hawaii pleads guilty to manslaughter, nearly 20 years after his disappearance", "wordcount_as_scraped": 548, "date": "20161202050000", "story_content": "HONOLULU \u2013 \u00a0The mother of a Hawaii boy who became the face of a campaign for missing and abused children pleaded guilty to manslaughter Thursday, confirming nearly 20 years after he disappeared that the child is dead.\n\nMore answers to what happened to the 6-year-old known as \"Peter Boy\" could be revealed when Jaylin Kema testifies against her husband, Peter Kema Sr., who is scheduled to go on trial for murder in April. Waiving her marital privilege and testifying truthfully is part of a plea deal with prosecutors.\n\nThe Kemas, who are both in jail, have long been suspects in the disappearance of Peter Boy, but prosecutors said they didn't have enough evidence to charge them until earlier this year when a grand jury indicted them on murder charges.\n\nPeter Kema has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. His attorney couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\n\nHawaii County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Ricky Damerville said Jaylin Kema agreed in court to facts he laid out about abuse the boy suffered, her failure to get him medical treatment and his eventual death.\n\nIn 1996 and 1997, extended family members, most of them now dead, were concerned the boy's father was abusing him. An arm injury was left untreated, festering and filling with puss until there was a hole so deep someone could put a finger inside it, Damerville said.\n\nDespite having health insurance, Jaylin Kema didn't get her son medical treatment and didn't report the abuse because she was afraid of her husband, Damerville said.\n\n\"I failed to protect my son,\" she said, crying as Damerville read the details in court, KHON-TV reported.\n\nSometime between May and June 1997, the couple's then-4-year-old daughter heard Jaylin Kema calling out for her husband and saw her trying to resuscitate the boy. She later saw her brother in a box, Damerville said.\n\nKema Sr. told authorities he took the child to Oahu and gave him to an \"Aunty Rose Makuakane\" in an informal adoption. Police could not find a woman as described by Kema or airline records indicating he had flown there.\n\nThe Big Island boy in the late 1990s and early 2000s became the face of a campaign for missing and abused children. Posters and bumper stickers asked, \"Where's Peter Boy?\"\n\nProsecutors believe Jaylin Kema doesn't know where the body is, Damerville said. Prosecutors believe he died from septic shock from not getting medical care.\n\nIn exchange for her testimony, prosecutors recommend a one-year sentence, with credit for time already served.

So far, some locals say all he's drained is enthusiasm the city usually has for a presidential inauguration.\n\nTrump and his supporters repeatedly disparaged the nation's capital throughout the presidential campaign, and its residents responded by giving him only 4.1 percent of their vote. Now, with many expressing concerns about demonstrations at next week's events, they're adding a collective yawn. Spirits seem more subdued than ever ahead of the city's quadrennial showcase, and the watchword seems to be: \"Don't talk politics.\"\n\n\"I never remembered an inauguration where politics seemed to override just general enthusiasm for what in Washington is the equivalent of the Super Bowl,\" said public relations consultant Vivian Deuschl, who's been involved on the hospitality side with every inauguration since 1988, was a TV commentator for two inaugurations and worked on Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan's presidential campaigns.\n\n\"My biggest advice for people is not to get into political discussions,\" Deuschl said.\n\nVIRGINIA NIGHTCLUB UNDER FIRE AFTER DECIDING NOT TO HOST PRO-TRUMP 'DELPLORABALL'\n\nBut if you're coming to Washington for next Friday's inauguration \u2014 whether it's to celebrate or protest Trump or just to enjoy the spectacle of watching a president take the oath of office for the 58th time \u2014 here are some things you should know.\n\nEvents\n\nDetails about many of the weekend's events are yet to be announced, but not because it's been hard to accommodate all the requests to perform. \"It's a whole new world in terms of how the inauguration is being celebrated,\" Deuschl said. \"It's much more low-key.\"\n\nAs required by the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, Trump will take the oath of office on the steps of the Capitol at noon on Jan. 20. (If you don't have tickets, the best viewing will be on monitors on the National Mall). The traditional inaugural parade to the White House will take place immediately afterward.\n\nAs of this writing, Trump has committed to attend only two official balls (President Obama attended 10 in 2009 and President George W. Bush \u00a0appeared at eight in 2001), starting at 7 p.m. at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. He'll also appear at the Salute to Our Armed Services Ball, which is open to active-duty members of the military. UPI is maintaining a list of unofficial balls, ranging from the long-running Black Tie and Boots Inaugural Ball to the debut of the Deplorables Inaugural Ball.\n\nJust as in 2009, a celebratory concert will take place at the Lincoln Memorial before the inauguration. But the concert held there for Obama eight years ago was broadcast live on HBO and featured\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9, Bruce Springsteen, Garth Brooks and dozens of other A-list performers. This year, the only celebs billed so far are Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. And at the time of the concert \u2014 Jan. 19, 4 p.m. \u2014 HBO will air \"Point Break\" (and not the Patrick Swayze version, but the crummy 2015 remake).\n\nKeep refreshing 58pic2017.org/events for details and announcements of additional events. For street and Metro station closures, follow @Inaug2017 and #Inaug2017 on Twitter and visit the District of Columbia's inauguration website.\n\nAccommodations\n\nWhile Trump's inaugural committee projects 2 to 3 million Americans will attend Trump taking the oath of office, security officials estimate that figure to be just 850,000 people (by comparison, Obama's first swearing in drew a record 1.8 million people to the nation's capital). Based on hotel occupancy rates available Wednesday afternoon, getting a last minute hotel room in D.C. is definitely still possible.\n\n\"Hotels aren't filling up at the pace they originally forecasted for the weekend,\" Clem Bason, CEO of goSeek.com, a hotel search site focusing on hotel deals, and the former president of discount travel site Hotwire.com, told FoxNews.com.\n\nWhen Bason examined occupancy rates on Expedia and Booking.com on Jan. 5, DC hotels rooms were about 93 percent filled for Jan. 20 to 22, with about 345 of the city's 495 hotels sold out completely and the average price for the remaining rooms going for $500 a night. But when Bason repeated his search a week later, he found hotel occupancy rates had dropped to just 82 percent, with the average nightly rate down to $439.\n\nFOR THE LATEST TRAVEL FEATURES FOLLOW FOX LIFESTYLE ON FACEBOOK\n\n\"That might seem counter-intuitive, but this could just mean that hotels were holding back rooms for sale at the last minute and have now released them to the online travel agencies for sale,\" Bason said indicating that now there may be greater capacity.\u00a0\n\nBut even half-a-grand still won't get you a room at a luxury hotel. The Four Seasons, Jefferson, Mandarin Oriental and both DC Ritz-Carltons are sold out. There are rooms available at the St. Regis, though \u2014 starting at $5,100 a night.\n\nThe high-end hotel getting the most attention, of course, is the Trump International Hotel Washington D.C., which opened in October. According to its website, the hotel is sold out Jan. 12\u201321. As to any special inauguration-themed amenities it's providing, or whether anyone has booked its $500,000 inaugural package, the hotel isn't saying.\u00a0\n\nFor more affordable lodging options, Bason recommends looking 35 miles north. \"In Baltimore, you can get a gorgeous four-star hotel for 200 bucks a night,\" Bason said. To get to D.C., you can just take an Uber or Amtrak.\n\nBason also suggests checking out Airbnb. \"They have 300-plus properties in the city to rent,\" Bason said. \"New stuff is coming online on Airbnb probably every hour to accommodate demand.\" Airbnb reports that the median price for bookings is $125 a night in the nation's capital for stays spanning inauguration weekend.\n\nAttire\n\nThe weather in Washington is unpredictable in January. This week, the temperature plummeted to 16 degrees on Monday and forecasters said it would be 61 degrees on Thursday. So pack accordingly.\n\nAnd if you were planning on traveling light and picking up a ball dress in D.C., don't worry. Though Trump says \"All the dress shops are sold out in Washington. It's hard to find a great dress for this inauguration,\" Elle, Jezebel, New York, People, Salon, Racked and the Washington Post have found formal dresses in D.C. are as abundant as duckweed in a swamp.\n\nAs Peter Marx,\u00a0owner of the D.C. boutique Saks Jandel, told People, \"There's never been less demand for inaugural ball gowns in my 38 years.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.5737704634666441, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1032, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.5089442791400005, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.93798449612403, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/19/invitations-in-hand-west-bank-settlers-head-to-inauguration.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [72]}}, "headline": "Invitations in hand, West Bank settlers head to inauguration", "wordcount_as_scraped": 991, "date": "20170119180000", "story_content": "JERUSALEM \u2013 \u00a0For nearly 50 years, Israel's settler movement has been criticized, condemned and ostracized by the international community. But on Friday, they say they will be greeted with open arms as invited guests to President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nA warm welcome in Washington would be by far the settlers' greatest accomplishment in terms of gaining international legitimacy, and reflects both the extraordinary nature of the Trump era and their own evolution into a dominant political force in Israel.\n\n\"I definitely agree that we are now getting the VIP treatment, which is something that we have been working on for many years,\" said Oded Revivi, chief foreign envoy of the Yesha Council, an umbrella group representing Israel's more than 120 West Bank settlements. \"You could basically argue that it has taken 50 years, since 1967, to be recognized on such a level for such an event.\"\n\nRevivi, who is mayor of the fast-growing Efrat settlement near Jerusalem, is leading the delegation on Friday, joined by two other mayors. He said the invite came from a member of Trump's \"first circle\" of advisers, but refused to name the person.\n\nHis office gave The Associated Press photos of invitations to the main inauguration ceremony and an inaugural ball.\n\nWhen asked if Trump, his incoming administration or inaugural committee had invited the settlers, inaugural committee spokesman Boris Epshteyn did not answer the question, saying in a statement only that no heads of state or heads of government were among the invited guests.\n\n\"The only representatives who will be invited are members of the diplomatic corps who are based here in Washington, D.C.,\" he said. Epshteyn did not reply to follow-up questions.\n\nThe invitation \u2014 the first of its kind for the settlers \u2014 is a stunning change for the movement, which began after Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nToday, there are some 400,000 Israelis living in West Bank settlements, in addition to roughly 200,000 Israelis in east Jerusalem, also captured in 1967. The Palestinians, with wide international backing, seek both areas for a future independent state.\n\nFor decades, U.S. presidents have joined the international community in condemning the settlements as obstacles to the peace process. Last month, the Obama administration allowed the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the settlements as a \"flagrant violation\" of international law. In a farewell speech, Secretary of State John Kerry also harshly criticized the settlements.\n\nThe settlers and their allies, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, defend the settlements on both security and religious grounds. They say east Jerusalem, home to key holy sites, is an eternal part of Israel's capital and not up for negotiation.\n\nAfter repeated clashes with Obama, Israel's nationalist right has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a much kinder approach toward them.\n\nTrump has appointed David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer who has raised millions of dollars for the Beit El settlement, as his ambassador to Israel. The foundation run by the family of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has also supported Beit El, and Trump himself has donated money to a Jewish seminary in the settlement through his foundation, tax records show.\n\n\"I think the new administration is definitely going to be one which is more responsive, more understanding and that is what's bringing definitely a lot of hope,\" Revivi said.\n\nHaving such access was unthinkable just a few months ago. Revivi described the Obama years as \"frustrating.\"\n\nHe said the new opportunities with Trump were the result of years of intense diplomatic efforts by the settler movement to forge ties with American officials, lawmakers and community leaders. During the presidential campaign, Trump supporters in Israel set up their headquarters in the West Bank to encourage American expatriates to support their candidate.\n\nRevivi said he has a \"detailed shopping list\" for the coming years that goes beyond expanded settlement construction, but he declined to elaborate, saying much would depend on Netanyahu and Trump.\n\n\"Inviting us over to his ceremony is an indication that the relationship is going to be different. When you have a dialogue, when you have a tight relationship, the sky is the limit,\" Revivi said.\n\nYesha opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state, but is also against the creation of a single \"binational state\" of Jews and Palestinians. Revivi said he favors an approach that would improve the quality of life for the West Bank's 2.3 million Palestinians, but not give them Israeli citizenship.\n\nCritics say this is unsustainable, and that the continued occupation will eventually force Israel to choose between remaining Jewish or democratic.\n\nTrump's campaign platform made no mention of a Palestinian state, and he has shown little affinity for the Palestinians. No Palestinian officials or dignitaries are believed to have been invited to the inauguration.\n\nTrump also has promised to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem \u2014 a key Israeli demand opposed by the Palestinians.\n\nPro-settlement lawmakers plan to introduce a bill Sunday calling on Israel to annex the large West Bank settlement of Maaleh Adumim. The bill's advocates say the timing is intentional because they believe the new administration will not oppose the move.\n\nThe Palestinians have issued dire warnings about any embassy move, saying it would prejudge negotiations on one of the most sensitive issues in the conflict. President Mahmoud Abbas has threatened to revoke recognition of Israel and cut off security ties, and religious leaders said Thursday an embassy move would \"drag the whole region into a religious feud that may have dire consequences.\"\n\nHanan Ashrawi, a top Palestinian official, said the incoming administration has sent \"very alarming signals\" about its intentions.\n\n\"By linking up with the settlers and the illegal settlements enterprise, Trump is placing the new American administration squarely outside the law and is encouraging Israeli lawlessness,\" she said. \"He is destroying the chances of peace and preparing for further conflict and instability and violence.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.62368667125702, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 958, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.7423823870899997, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170119180000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.81837160751566, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/11/massive-security-preparations-under-way-for-inauguration-amid-protest-threats-to-paralyze-dc.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [661, 668, 674, 688, 711, 1275, 1276, 3801, 4702, 5365]}}, "headline": "Massive security preparations under way for inauguration, amid protest threats to 'paralyze' DC", "wordcount_as_scraped": 809, "date": "20170111230000", "story_content": "The stage is set for President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration \u2013 not just the traditional swearing-in platform on Capitol Hill, but a massive security presence amid protest plans to \"shut down\" the nation's capital.\n\nMost crowd estimates for the Jan. 20 festivities are far short of the record-setting 1.8 million visitors for President Obama's historic 2009 inauguration.

Jonathan Blyth, the group's spokesman, told FoxNews.com on Wednesday. \"We've been preparing for this since the last inauguration. We're focused to protecting and honoring a new commander in chief.\"\n\nThe task force and its Capitol Hill counterpart are holding a \"dress rehearsal\" this weekend for the swearings-in, the Presidential Review of troops and the parade along the roughly 2.5-mile stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nSeveral protest groups planning large-scale demonstrations have permits in place and have already held organizational meetings, among them the collaborative DisruptJ20.\n\n\"We're planning a series of massive, direct actions that will shut down the inauguration ceremonies and any related celebrations,\" the group says. \"We're also planning to paralyze the city.\"\n\nOrganizers say they are targeting everything from the parade to the balls and plan to use blockades and protesters to stop traffic, public transit and parties.\n\nThe group RefuseFacism.org is planning a small-scale protest Saturday in the city's McPherson Square, just blocks from the White House, that organizers hope will grow into larger inauguration-weekend protests.\n\nThe group burned U.S. flags this summer at the Democratic and Republican national conventions and this week tried to disrupt the Senate confirmation hearing for Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions to become Trump's attorney general.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to meet with [Trump], but I would say to him, 'You're a fascist. Your regime is illegitimate.' And it must not be allowed to take power,\" the group's Carl Dix told Fox on Wednesday on Capitol Hill. Dix acknowledged the group doesn't have a federal or city permit to protest but still intends to \"stop the regime.\"\n\nThe two major groups with permits are a pro-Trump organization and the ANSWER Coalition, which turned out the largest anti-war protests during the Bush years and next weekend has a permit for a mass protest at Freedom Plaza, near the parade route.\u00a0\n\nThe other group is Bikers for Trump, a familiar presence on last year's campaign trail and visitors to both 2016 major-party conventions. The group's permit shows members at John Marshall Park, near the Canadian Embassy and close to the parade route.\n\nThe biggest protest is expected to take place the following day -- the Women's March on Washington. Organizers have finally received a permit and estimate 200,000 attendees, with celebrities such as Amy Schumer and Scarlett Johansson reportedly among them.\n\nBlyth said the big variable next weekend, as usual, will be the weather.\n\nEight inches of snow fell the night before John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961.\n\n\"The weather is always the biggest challenge,\" Blyth said. \"We're reading the Farmer's Almanac and always checking forecasts.\"\n\nThe 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee will hold at least two official -- or \"sanctioned\" -- balls.\u00a0\n\nAmong the other balls that week will be the Deplorables Inaugural Ball, at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, and the Salute to the Heroes Inaugural Ball, at the Renaissance hotel downtown.\n\nTrump boasted this week that so many people are attending balls and other events that dress shops are sold out. However, Calypso St. Barts women's shop, in Georgetown, said Wednesday it has plenty of options still available.\n\n\"We still have many nice pieces, including some cocktail dresses,\" store manager Briona Jackson said. \"We have items on sale and can get gowns from our other stores.\"\n\nFox News' Griff Jenkins contributed to this report.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 22, "AuthorityVice": 7, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.78197062015533, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 805, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.59827174968, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 45, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.590062111801241, "mft_mean": 4.090909090909999}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/08/budget-bill-hinges-on-legislative-stocking-stuffers.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1915, 2080]}}, "headline": "Budget bill hinges on legislative stocking stuffers", "wordcount_as_scraped": 924, "date": "20161208140000", "story_content": "Well, it's not quite a priest, a minister and a rabbi walking into a bar.\n\nBut here's a riddle for you.\n\nWhat do the Flint, Mich., water crisis; a drought in California; retired Gen. James Mattis; miners' health benefits; the Oakland warehouse fire; Pearl Harbor Day and efforts to avoid a government shutdown have to do with when Congress can adjourn for the holidays?\n\nEverything.\n\nAnd each component hinges on the other as Congress tries to wrap its work for the year.\n\n\"We always try to have a little drama for you guys,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nThe question is when lawmakers will try to bail on Washington for the rest of the year.\n\nDon't expect high-wire drama about a government shutdown. That's out of the question. But lawmakers must unravel a Gordian knot before they tie a bow around 2016.\n\nThe government is funded through Friday at 11:59:59 pm ET. The House plans to vote Thursday on an interim spending bill (called a \"Continuing Resolution,\" or \"CR\") which runs the government through April 28, 2017. But the Senate could be another enterprise. The CR includes a controversial \"framework\" provision to expedite a bill next year to help James Mattis become Defense secretary. Legally, Mattis can't serve as Pentagon chief unless Congress grants him a \"waiver.\" National security law stipulates that former active duty military personnel must be off the job for seven years before qualifying for the Defense secretary post. Mattis retired in 2013.\n\nThere was some initial consternation about the Mattis provision in the CR. Some senior House Democrats claimed the Mattis effort poisoned the entire legislation. But reservations dissipated Wednesday.\n\nMore substantial problems linger over an effort by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to address California's drought in a separate water infrastructure plan.\u00a0 Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., could block that bill over environmental concerns and the Endangered Species Act. Such a maneuver could hold consequences for Flint. \u00a0\n\nThe CR itself includes $170 million for Michigan's water programs -- but not explicitly money tagged for Flint. The wild card is the water infrastructure measure. Congress must approve that bill in order to expressly direct $100 million to Flint. In other words, congressional leaders bifurcated the Flint process. This dares Democrats to vote no on both bills. If Boxer succeeds on the drought, Flint fails to receive money for the water crisis. That's because the trigger mechanism to send the money to Flint lives in the water infrastructure bill -- not the CR.\n\nSo even as the House is poised to okay the CR, the Senate could be a day or more away.\n\nBy Wednesday evening, health care programs for retired miners emerged as perhaps the biggest issue threatening immediate passage of the CR. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., led the charge to delay passage of the stopgap spending bill. Manchin argues the CR offers miners a four-month Band-Aid to maintain their health care. He wants a longer package.\n\nNot every Pearl Harbor Day presents senators the opportunity to object to a resolution marking the attack \u2013 especially on the 75th anniversary of the raid. But that's exactly what unfolded on the Senate floor Wednesday. Manchin and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, blocked a number of non-controversial resolutions which usually slip through the body without much fanfare. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., repeatedly tried to earn clearance from Manchin and Brown on a panoply of measures. But the Democrats alternated in their objections on the grounds that they weren't budging until the miners found justice.\n\nThe Ohio Democrat noted that his GOP colleagues often demand \"certainty\" from Congress for corporate interests.\n\n\"But it's alright for mine workers to jack them around. Pardon my language,\" said Brown. \"We're not leaving.\"\n\nTillis tried to advance separate measures honoring those killed in the recent Oakland warehouse fire and the Pearl Harbor resolution. But those plans ran into the Manchin/Brown buzzsaw.\n\n\"Until we have that long-term solution included in the Miners Protection Act, I am going to have to object,\" said Manchin when Tillis tried to move the Oakland fire resolution.\n\nBrown stalled the Pearl Harbor observance.\n\n\"I'm for these resolutions,\" said Brown. \"But they're not resolutions to provide college to the children of the people who died in the fire. Not to the grandchildren of the people who died at Pearl Harbor. They're resolutions that don't mean anything except they're nice.\"\n\nDemocrats stumbled in the election to connect with working-class voters. Manchin said blocking the CR over miner benefits could resonate with the very people who supported President-elect Donald Trump. \n\n\"People felt they were abandoned,\" said Manchin. \"This gives them a chance to stand for them.\" \n\nSo what happens if the House approves the CR and the Senate fails? \n\nThe House and Senate would simply okay an even \"shorter\" CR. This would keep the government lights on through early next week. The House would obviously have to approve the package before adjourning.\n\nIt's possible the Senate could remain in session through Monday.

But we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border,\" Trump said Sunday afternoon. \"This is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. \u2026 My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.\"\n\nTrump issued the statement as hundreds of protesters marched in Washington and in other cities across the country to protest the president's self-described \"extreme vetting\" -- which resulted this weekend in dozens of foreign visitors and some legal permanent U.S. residents being detained at domestic airports.\n\nEarlier in the day, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., staged a press conference with some immigrant children and adults impacted by the bans and vowed to fight them on Capitol Hill \"with every fiber of my being.\"\n\nSen.\u00a0Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., said that she would introduce two bills Monday. One of the bills would rescind Trump's order, while the other would give Congress greater oversight of the president's immigration authority. \u00a0\n\nAnd California Democratic Rep. Lou Correa said the executive orders on illegal immigration \"directly challenge the right to due process under the Constitution\" and that he'll introduce legislation to fund legal aid to those who are \"targeted.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats led by Schumer, who said he's already appealed to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, will have a difficult task getting any kind of measure through the Republican-control Congress that would reverse the executive order.\n\n\"I doubt many Arkansans or Americans more broadly object to taking a harder look at foreigners coming into our country from war-torn nations with known terror networks. I think they're wondering why we don't do that already,\" said Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton, who as an Army officer served combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHowever, Trump is facing opposition for some congressional Republicans, including Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, of Florida, and Barbara Comstock, of Virginia, along with Sens. Ben Sasse, of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and John McCain, of Arizona.\n\n\"It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump's executive order was not properly vetted,\" Graham and McCain said in a joint statement. \"Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\"\n\nTrump, a Republican, tweeted in response that the statement was \"wrong\" and that the senators were \"sadly weak on immigration.\"\n\nThe executive order Trump issued Friday imposes a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program and a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon -- as reports surfaced about foreign visitors being detained at New York's Kennedy airport and elsewhere -- Trump said his plan to prevent Islamic terrorists and others for attacking the United States was \"working out very nicely.\"\n\nBut by Saturday evening, a federal judge in Brooklyn issued a temporary halt on the part of the executive order that allows the Trump administration to deport people from the largely-Muslim countries.\n\n\"Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!,\" Trump tweeted Sunday morning.\n\nMeanwhile, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, told \"Fox News Sunday\": \"These are countries that have a history of training, harboring, exporting terrorists.\"\n\nAnd White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus argued that as many as 80 percent of Americans agree with the policy change, while dismissing media reports about chaotic scenes Saturday at U.S. airports.\n\n\"I do not think there was any chaos,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" while predicting more people will be detained and offering \"no apologies.\"\n\nPriebus also seemed to suggest that foreign arrivals who have so-called \"green cards\" that allows them to permanently live and work in the United States will not be subject to the additional screenings.\n\n\"As far as green-card holders going forward, it doesn't affect them,\" he told NBC.\n\nKelly said later that allowed green card holders into the country \u00a0was \"in the national interest\" of the country.\n\nAnd Tennessee GOP Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman \u00a0of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said Trump's order had been \"poorly implemented, especially with respect to green card holders.\"\n\nTrump, Conway and Priebus argued Sunday that the seven countries were in fact identified by President Obama in 2015 and pointed out that roughly 40 other such nations included Afghanistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia were not part of the travel ban.\n\nTrump is also facing opposition from attorneys general in 15 states and the District of Columbia, who issued a statement Sunday condemning his order as \"unconstitutional, un-American and unlawful.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.6770601272583, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 808, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 14, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.442370078740001, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 12, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 62, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170130000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 7.67326732673267, "mft_mean": 5.6363636363600005}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/01/weed-guns-and-catfish-2017-brings-new-laws-big-changes.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [812, 1171, 1281, 1926, 2512, 2520, 3003, 3020, 3118, 3135, 3391, 3418, 3667, 3686, 4016, 4044, 4334]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 678, "scraper_regex": 714}}, "headline": "Weed, guns and catfish: 2017 brings new laws, big changes", "wordcount_as_scraped": 714, "date": "20170101150000", "story_content": "Just because Congress ground to a virtual halt in 2016 doesn't mean the country stopped making new laws.\n\nFrom taxes to minimum wage to gun control, a broad range of changes is coming at the state level as Americans ring in 2017. And, as has been the trend lately, the new year will bring far broader legalization of marijuana.\n\nIt's what The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, in a letter to Vice President-elect Mike Pence arguing against pot prohibitions, called an \"unprecedented schism between state and federal law in regards to \u2026 cannabis statutes.\" While that debate will play out anew as the Trump administration takes office with a law-and-order mandate, the \"schism\" grows wider in 2017.\n\nAlready, revelers in Massachusetts\u00a0and California will have the legal option of pairing their New Year's Eve champagne with a joint. Approved by voters in November, legal recreational pot use took effect on Dec. 15 in Massachusetts; legal personal use of the drug took effect in California shortly after voters approved it there, though retail sales are still months away from implementation. \u00a0\n\nNevada legalized recreational pot on Jan. 1, and Maine will follow soon after.\n\nVoters in the last election\u00a0approved legalizing the drug for medical purposes in North Dakota, Montana, Florida and Arkansas. In Colorado, one of the first states to legalize pot, licensed medical marijuana growers will now be allowed to sell pot as well.\n\nColorado voters also backed an increase in the statewide minimum wage.\n\nStarting Jan. 1, the wage increased from $8.31 to $9.30 per hour for non-tipped workers and will increase by $0.90 per hour every year until it reaches $12 an hour on Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nVoters in Maine, Arizona and Washington also voted in favor of minimum wage hikes. An appeals court in Arizona recently rejected an effort by state businesses to\u00a0delay the Jan. 1 implementation.\n\nAs wage hikes enter the pipeline, so have tax hikes:\n\nIn Portland, Ore., the city council passed a so-called CEO tax, a first-in-the-nation ordinance to put a tax surcharge on publicly traded companies whose CEOs earn 100 times more than the median wage of other company employees. According to the National Law Review, a surcharge of 10 percent of the base tax liability would be imposed on those companies beginning on Jan. 1.\n\nBuying presents next Christmas or anything from Amazon also will be more expensive for Utah residents in 2017 thanks to a\u00a0new law\u00a0requiring online retailers to charge consumers a 4.7 state sales tax at the point of sale, rather than relying on the honor system.\n\nOn the tax relief side of the ledger, Illinois approved a measure tossing out a 6.25 percent \"luxury\" tax on tampons.\n\nIllinois passed dozens of other laws, including changes so that starting Jan. 1 it will no longer be illegal to catch catfish using a pitchfork, speargun or bow and arrow. Critically, the term \"public hunting ground for pheasants\"\u00a0will be replaced\u00a0by \"public hunting ground for game birds.\"\n\nOn the West Coast, gun owners in California will face\u00a0new restrictions\u00a0after Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law banning the purchase of semiautomatic rifles with so-called \"evil features.\"\n\nThe \"evil features\" include pistol grips, flash hiders and bullet-buttons that make it easier to remove and replace ammunition magazines. The\u00a0Los Angeles Times reported\u00a0an increase in gun purchases in the lead-up to the Jan. 1 implementation.\n\nThe gun measure is one of the few new California laws that do not have roots on the desk of state Sen. Jerry Hill, the sponsor of 17 bills taking effect in the new year. The\u00a0laws run the gamut\u00a0from how police store their weapons in their vehicles to tour bus safety to restrictions on water use.\n\nWhile Congress itself largely was inactive over the past year, a new regulation stemming from the Affordable Care Act, and set to take effect Jan. 1, could have far-reaching implications across the country.\n\nUnder the change,\u00a0states will have the option\u00a0to seek so-called Section 1332 waivers to try to modify parts of ObamaCare for their residents. A number of states have sought to get that process started \u2013 though the incoming Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress want to repeal and replace the law as a whole next year.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.9162303805351261, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 678, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.8919952219200002, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170101150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.2448377581120895, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/12/migrants-arrested-in-italy-for-smuggling-may-be-victims.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [73]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 931, "scraper_regex": 992}}, "headline": "Migrants arrested in Italy for smuggling may be victims", "wordcount_as_scraped": 992, "date": "20161212110000", "story_content": "PACHINO, Sicily \u2013 \u00a0All migrant Marc Samie has of his fiancee is a picture in his mind. Louise, seven and a half months pregnant, is standing silently on a beach in Libya, tears rolling down her face as traffickers force him at gunpoint into a rubber dinghy with a compass.\n\nThe armed men had ordered Samie to hold the compass and a satellite phone for navigation on the journey to Italy. He refused. So they fired a Kalashnikov at the ground between his legs, and told him to take the compass or they would kill the couple. They said she would be on the next boat.\n\nThat was last July, and he hasn't laid eyes on her since. But instead of being treated as a victim in Italy, Samie was arrested by police and charged with facilitating illegal immigration.\n\nSamie, a 21-year-old from Togo, is one of hundreds of migrants who are caught up in the Italian legal system as police, prosecutors and judges struggle to combat human trafficking. They are the victims of a new tactic where professional smugglers avoid being caught by forcing migrants, many of them minors, to take the helm of the boats.\n\nAlmost every day, Italian officials detain men accused of driving the boats, but don't know if they are traffickers or migrants. While overall numbers are not available, 179 smugglers \u2014 26 of them minors \u2014 were detained this year at the port of Pozzallo alone, where Samie came in. That compares to 147 last year.\n\nIn another port, Augusta, more than 190 smugglers have been arrested so far this year, according to police. And in Catania district, trafficking arrests have risen dramatically from 13 in 2013 to 79 as of August.\n\nPolice are well aware that they aren't reaching the criminals who are behind the trafficking and reaping the profits. To date, Italian police haven't obtained the arrest of a migrant trafficker in Libya, said Andrea Bonomo, deputy prosecutor for Catania.\n\n\"(We are) making the arrests at what I would define as the lowest level, the so-called smugglers, the ones who drive the boats and who are often migrants,\" he said. \"They risk their lives together with the others.\"\n\nThere are no numbers on convictions. But smugglers can get five to 15 years in prison, Bonomo added.\n\nIn early November, police stood in the port of Augusta watching hundreds of migrants disembark from a navy rescue ship. Interpreters interviewed them to try to figure out who was driving the boats and holding the compasses.\n\nTrafficking organizations in Libya now make cheap dinghies that can only last for eight to nine hours in the water before they sink, Marshal Tonio Panzanaro said. The traffickers then take what he calls \"last-minute\" smugglers, migrants who are sometimes given a free ride, and make them drive the boat. Behind it all is a \"huge movement of money,\" he noted, with professional traffickers earning 100,000 euros ($105,000) from a dinghy that costs just 2,000 ($2,100).\n\n\"Our problem is that we know how they are operating in Libya, but since there is no government we can't take the final step, that of arresting the organizers,\" he said.\n\nNot all boat drivers and navigators are treated as smugglers. On Sept. 7, Gigi Modica, a judge in Palermo threw out the case against two accused smugglers, a Somali and a Gambian. The men were driving and holding the compass on a rubber dinghy with 118 migrants on board. A dozen passengers died, and the men were accused of multiple manslaughter.\n\nModica concluded that the two presumed smugglers were actually migrants forced by armed Libyans to drive the boat. Neither seemed to have any experience, they spoke different languages and they couldn't communicate with one another. In his statement, he wrote that they had been threatened with death, and he ordered them to be freed immediately.\n\nModica said Libyan traffickers are choosing sub-Saharan Africans to drive the boats and take the compasses. He said defendants had told of friends being killed by traffickers because they refused to lead the boats.\n\nHe added that it is clear when those directing the boat aren't the real smugglers.\n\n\"They are weak. They are fragile. They are scared. They can only talk with lots of difficulty,\" he said. \"It's evident that they aren't part of the problem. They are a victim of the problem.\"\n\nIn the small Sicilian town of Pachino, eight young African men live in a home run by an organization called Open Europe. Like Samie, many of them were accused of either driving the boat or holding the compass. Several received expulsion orders.\n\nThe organization allowed The Associated Press to talk to a Gambian who says he is 15 years old, on condition that his name not be used because he is a minor.\n\nHe was on the beach in Libya waiting to climb into a dinghy when armed men told him he had to hold the compass. He replied that he didn't even know how to use a compass. They threatened to kill him, and beat him with a pipe. He slides up the sleeve of his green sweat suit to reveal a 6-centimeter (2-inch) scar.\n\n\"I got inside the boat before they killed me and my mother wouldn't see me again,\" he said.\n\nWhen he arrived in Italy, he was arrested and held for 15 days before receiving an expulsion order, which he is appealing.\n\nSamie also spent 15 days in jail before he was asked to sign an expulsion order. He then headed back to the port in search of news of Louise, but there was nothing.\n\nHe is now appealing his expulsion order. In the meantime, he has sent off various emails to organizations, looking for Louise. He has no idea if she is alive or gave birth to their baby.\n\n\"The last time I saw her, she cried,\" he said. \"I just said to her, we'll meet here ... I will wait for her.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.85440635681152, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 931, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.3105936413, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161212110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.82599355531686, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/28/guns-fall-silent-but-tensions-high-between-india-pakistan.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [71]}}, "headline": "Guns fall silent, but tensions high between India, Pakistan", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1069, "date": "20161128130000", "story_content": "NEW DELHI \u2013 \u00a0An uneasy calm has fallen over the de facto border between the Indian and Pakistani-controlled portions of Kashmir after months of deadly firing and signs that the two countries were engaged in a brinkmanship not seen for decades.\n\nThough guns have gone silent for the past five days, analysts say the two nuclear-armed neighbors have displayed unprecedented aggression this year without pursuing any real lines of diplomacy. They've amped up the artillery they've used and targeted infrastructure instead of just military outposts. The corpses of soldiers killed in battle have been found mutilated.\n\n\"The level of retaliation was definitely more intense than what India has done in the past,\" said defense analyst C. Uday Bhaskar of the New Delhi-based think tank Society for Policy Studies.\n\n\"There is a danger of it spiraling out of control,\" Bhaskar said. \"If both sides decide that neither side will blink, then the collateral damage will only increase.\"\n\nThat could also mean recalling diplomats, halting the buses ferrying people back and forth across the border, or stopping all trade. In 2015, bilateral trade amounted to just $2.6 billion \u2014 far below the $10.9 billion Indian government economists say is possible under normal relations.\n\nIndia and Pakistan have long been foes, fighting two of their three wars over their rival claims to the Himalayan region of Kashmir. Countless rounds of peace talks have yielded scant results.\n\nThe two sides reached a cease-fire agreement in 2003 which held for the first few years, but has seen frequent violations since then. Meanwhile, India accuses Pakistan of arming and training Kashmiri rebels fighting to oust India from the Muslim-majority region. Pakistan denies the allegation, saying it offers the rebels only moral support, and accuses India of an illegal military occupation of the disputed mountain territory.\n\nTensions began building this year as Kashmiri civilians on the Indian-controlled side rose up in rebellion, demanding independence or a merger with Pakistan. Violent street protests and clashes with Indian forces left 90 civilians dead and thousands injured.\n\nThe situation escalated further in September after anti-India rebels launched an attack on an Indian army base in the western Kashmiri town of Uri, killing 19 soldiers.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi promised \"a befitting reply to those who dare to attack India,\" and India retaliated by sending small groups of military commandos across the border for what it called \"surgical strikes\" on terror bases. India said a dozen suspected rebels were slain, which Pakistan denied.\n\nPakistan's outgoing military chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif, promised that \"India will be taught a lesson.\"\n\nThe two sides then spent two months firing aggressively at each other. As days turned to weeks, villagers were evacuated from areas near the Line of Control, the de facto border that divides Kashmir into the separate territories administered by India and Pakistan.\n\nPakistan, along with some residents near the border, accused India of using the Uri attack to ramp up border hostilities in order to distract attention from the public protests within Indian-controlled Kashmir.\n\nAs the shelling intensified, schools near the frontier were shut down indefinitely. Farmers abandoned their crops to rot. Pakistani cinemas banned Bollywood films, while Indian filmmakers vowed to never hire Pakistani actors.\n\nLast week, the body of one of three Indian soldiers killed by rebels was found mutilated, a month after another Indian soldier was found beheaded.\n\nIndian military officers, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with military rules, acknowledged the tensions have escalated to the highest level since the cease-fire came into effect.\n\n\"Our reaction time is swift and severe. It's no more wait and watch, no more hold your fire to see what the higher bosses have to say,\" an army officer in Kashmir said.\n\nIndian officials said Pakistan has violated the cease-fire agreement more than 300 times in the last two months by firing and shelling military positions and villages, killing at least 17 Indian soldiers and 12 civilians in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir.\n\nPakistan has countered with its own list of 44 casualties, including 11 civilians that it said were killed when a civilian bus came under fire.\n\nThere were anxious moments last week as Pakistan shelled the border district of Gurez, close to a hydropower project that India is building, forcing authorities to suspend work.\n\nThere had been signs when Modi took office in 2014 that he might seek to work with Pakistan toward normalizing relations. He invited his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, to his inauguration in New Delhi. A year later when returning to India from a trip abroad, Modi dropped in on Sharif at his home in Lahore to give him greetings on his birthday.\n\nThe bonhomie was short lived.\n\nAn attack on an Indian air force base in January and the assault on the army base in Uri eight months later left the 2003 cease-fire agreement in tatters.\n\nMeanwhile, both countries face domestic pressure to take a harder line. Modi's Hindu nationalist party, in campaigning for some state elections, has once again whipped up a jingoistic fervor against Pakistan.\n\nIn Pakistan, a new army chief was appointed over the weekend. But analysts in both India and Pakistan said they do not expect any major change in Islamabad's position, as the army chief would not want to be seen as selling out.\n\nGiven that Pakistan's military plays a \"dominating role\" in shaping the country's foreign policy, \"I don't think there will be any change in our policy toward India,\" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert at COMSATS Institute of Information Technology in Islamabad.\n\nAt the border, military commanders from the two sides agreed to halt all firing, but there was no indication of how long the calm would last.\n\nAnalysts said the space was shrinking for diplomatic steps to resolve the countries' differences.\n\n\"Pakistan asked for a cease-fire primarily because we made life unlivable for them near the border,\" said G. Parthasarathy, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan.\n\nWhat is clear is India and Pakistan have once again hit a low in their testy relationship, analysts say.\n\n\"The relationship with Pakistan is at a nadir at the moment,\" said Gurmeet Kanwal, a retired army brigadier at the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses, a state-run think tank in New Delhi.\n\n___\n\nHussain reported from Srinagar, India.

His face was swollen and bloodied. Police informed me that he had suffered gunshot wounds.

We can judge him now.\n\nFor six decades the left has lauded Castro as a secular savior, seeing only what they wanted to see and reporting only what the Cuban government wanted them to report.\n\nExamples are legion, but this one is typical: In February 1988, the State Department named Cuba one of the world's biggest human rights oppressors. NBC News reporter Ed Rabel visited Havana to check it out. \n\nRich Noyes of the Media Research Center, the conservative media watchdog, writes: \"NBC's conciliatory approach allowed Castro to spew lies about his drug connections and the wonderful achievements of the Cuban revolution.\" Rabel reported, \"There is, in Cuba, government intrusion into everyone's life, from the moment he is born until the day he dies. The reasoning is that the government wants to better the lives of its citizens and keep them from exploiting or hurting one another. ... On a sunny day in a park in the old city of Havana it is difficult to see anything that is sinister.\"\n\nOver the years, celebrities made pilgrimages to Havana. Each time they marveled at the supposed excellence of Cuba's medical care and quality of education. In the immediate aftermath of Castro's death, the pattern was repeated. Typical was Andrea Mitchell, who gushed on MSNBC: \"(Castro) gave his people better health care and education.\"\n\nMitchell and other Castro disciples apparently never read a July 2007 article in National Review titled, \"The Myth of Cuban Health Care.\" The magazine was among many publications that destroyed the notion of outstanding health care in Cuba, noting that the country offers three medical tiers. One tier is for celebrities and tourists, requiring payment in hard cash to help bolster the regime. The second tier is for Cuba's top government officials. The third tier is for everyone else, which the magazine called \"\u2026wretched. Hospitals and clinics are crumbling. Conditions are so unsanitary, patients may be better off at home, whatever home is. If they do go to the hospital, they must bring their own bed sheets, soap, towels, food, light bulbs, even toilet paper. And basic medications are scarce \u2026 finding an aspirin can be a chore. And an antibiotic will fetch a fortune on the black market.\"\n\nAs for \"excellence\" in Cuba's education system, a February 2015 article in The Atlantic punctured that myth: \"Under Fidel Castro, education became universal \u2014 but he also stipulated that anyone who received this education would have to actively promote government policies both during and after their schooling. They would also be required to take government-approved courses that didn't tolerate any criticism of socialism as a way of life. In other words, education was seen as key to the revolution taking hold and creating a literate population loyal to the government.\"\n\nThe left, so concerned about human rights in America and other non-communist countries, ignores their violations in Cuba. \n\nAs Human Rights Watch noted earlier this year, \"The Cuban government continues to repress dissent and discourage public criticism. While in recent years it has relied less on long-term prison sentences to punish its critics, short-term arbitrary arrests of human rights defenders, independent journalists, and other critics have increased dramatically. Other repressive tactics employed by the government include beatings, public acts of shaming, and the termination of employment.\"\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's statement was more direct and accurate than President Obama's: \"Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro's legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.\"\n\nThis should be history's judgment on Fidel Castro, depending on who writes it.\n\n\n\nCal Thomas is America's most widely syndicated op-ed columnist.

He is being held in the Geary County jail in Junction City, which is about 120 miles west of Kansas City.\n\nU.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, from Iowa and chairman of the judiciary committee, co-signed a Dec. 9 letter with Moran and Roberts to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, calling it \"an extremely disturbing case\" and questioning how Martinez-Maldonado was able to re-enter and remain in the country.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it has placed a detainer \u2014 a request to turn Martinez-Maldonado over to ICE custody before he is released \u2014 with Geary County. ICE declined to discuss his specific case beyond its October statement regarding the 10 deportations.\n\nCourt filings show Martinez-Maldonado has two misdemeanor convictions for entering without legal permission in cases prosecuted in 2013 and 2015 in U.S. District Court of Arizona, where he was sentenced to serve 60 days and 165 days respectively.\n\nA status hearing in the rape case is scheduled for Jan. 10. Defense attorney Lisa Hamer declined to comment on the charge, but said, \"criminal law and immigration definitely intersect and nowadays it should be the responsibility of every criminal defense attorney to know the possible ramifications in the immigration courts.\"\n\nNationwide, 52 percent of all federal prosecutions in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 were for entry or re-entry without legal permission and similar immigration violations, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.\n\nIt's not unusual to see immigrants with multiple entries without legal permission, said David Trevino, a Topeka immigration attorney who has provided legal advice to Martinez-Maldonado's family. Most of Martinez-Maldonado's family lives in Mexico, but he also has family in the United States, and the family is \"devastated,\" Trevino said.\n\n\"(President-elect Donald Trump) can build a wall 100 feet high and 50 feet deep, but it is not going to keep family members separated. So if someone is deported and they have family members here ... they will find a way back \u2014 whether it is through the air, under a wall, through the coast of the United States,\" Trevino said.\n\nHe declined to comment on Martinez-Maldonado's criminal history and pending charge.\n\nRecords obtained by AP show Martinez-Maldonado had eight voluntary removals before his first deportation in 2010, which was followed by another voluntary removal that same year. He was deported five more times between 2011 and 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Martinez-Maldonado was charged with entering without legal permission, a misdemeanor, and subsequently deported in early 2014 after serving his sentence. He was deported again a few months later, as well as twice in 2015 \u2014 including the last one in October 2015 after he had served his second sentence, the records show.\n\nICE said in an emailed statement that when it encounters a person who's been deported multiple times or has a significant criminal history and was removed, it routinely presents those cases to the U.S. attorney's office for possible criminal charges.\n\nCosme Lopez, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Arizona, declined comment on why prosecutors twice dismissed felony re-entry after deportation charges against Martinez-Maldonado in 2013 and 2015 in exchange for guilty pleas on misdemeanor entry charges.\n\nArizona ranks third in the nation \u2014 behind only the Southern District of Texas and the Western District of Texas \u2014 for the number of immigration prosecutions among the nation's 94 federal judicial districts for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse records show.\n\nMoran told the AP in an email that the immigration system is \"broken.\"\n\n\"There must be serious legislative efforts to address U.S. immigration policy, and we must have the ability to identify, prosecute and deport illegal aliens who display violent tendencies before they have an opportunity to perpetrate these crimes in the United States,\" he said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 20, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.33249044418335, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 672, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.379201742849999, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 10, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 53, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161231070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 7.886904761904759, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.81818181818}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/19/at-least-12-dead-48-injured-after-truck-plows-into-berlin-christmas-market-in-apparent-terror-attack.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [612, 1626, 4987, 5531]}}, "headline": "At least 12 dead, 48 injured after truck plows into Berlin Christmas market in apparent terror attack", "wordcount_as_scraped": 988, "date": "20161220020000", "story_content": "A truck rammed into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injured 48 others in what witnesses described as a deliberate attack.\n\n\nGerman authorities said they are still investigating whether the crash was an accident, but a statement from the White House National Security Council (NSC) said the incident \"appears to have been a terrorist attack.\"\n\nThe large Scania truck with a Polish license plate crashed into the market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.\u00a0The truck came to a halt on a sidewalk on one side of the market, shortly after ramming a large stand called \"Fascination Christmas,\" ripping off one side and knocking down a large Christmas tree. The three-meter tree lay in the street, red and gold ornamental balls still attached to its limbs and a golden star at the top.\n\n\nPolice said a suspect believed to be the driver was arrested about 1 1/2 miles away, near Berlin's Victory Column monument. A passenger in the truck died at the scene as paramedics were attending to him.\n\nAuthorities initially estimated that 50 people were injured. Police later revised the total to 48, while Berlin's fire brigade said others were \"more mentally injured.\"\n\nThe Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle, driven by his cousin, may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning.\n\n\n\"They must have done something to my driver,\" he told TVN24.\u00a0Zurawski added that the truck had been loaded with steel structures weighing 25 tons.\n\nDie Welt newspaper reported that the arrested suspect is a Pakistani known to police for minor criminal offenses, but not terrorism. The newspaper also reported that the dead passenger was a Polish national.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the incident had a chilling echo of the July 14 truck attack in Nice, France that killed 86 people.\n\nISIS claimed responsibility for the Nice attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. ISIS and Al Qaeda have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack public places.\n\nMike Fox, a tourist from Birmingham, England, told The Associated Press at the scene in Berlin that the large truck missed him by about three yards as it drove into the market, tearing through tables and wooden stands.\n\n\"It was definitely deliberate,\" Fox said. Fox said he helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands.\n\n\nDozens of ambulances lined the streets waiting to evacuate people, and heavily armed police patrolled the area. Police on Twitter urged people to stay away from the area, saying they needed to keep the streets clear for the rescue vehicles.\n\nFederal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, took over the investigation, according to German Justice Minister Heiko Maas. But Berlin's top security official, state interior minister Andreas Geisel, told RBB television that it was too early to say whether it was an attack, and called reports that the truck may have been hijacked \"pure speculation.\"\n\nEven so, some politicians were pointing fingers. Marcus Pretzell, a prominent member of the anti-migration Alternative for Germany party, lashed out at the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying on Twitter: \"When will the German state of law strike back? When will this cursed hypocrisy finally stop? These are Merkel's dead! (hash)Nice (hash)Berlin.\"\n\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump issued a statement calling the attack \"horrifying.\"\n\n\"Innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday,\" Trump said. \"ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners.\"\n\nGermany has not experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by ISIS group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach. Both attackers were killed.\n\nThose attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, helped stoke tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants.\n\nMonday's incident comes less than a month after the State Department warned U.S. citizens to be cautious in markets and other public places, saying extremist groups were focusing \"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events.\"\n\nIn a statement, State Department spokesman John Kirby condemned the \"horrendous events\" at the Christmas market.\u00a0\n\nNSC spokesman Ned Price said the United States has already been in contact with German officials and stands ready to assist in the investigation and response.\n\nLaw enforcement sources tell Fox News that the FBI's Legal Attache (LEGAT) office in Berlin had been in touch with German officials to offer intelligence support to investigators. The sources said late Monday that no Americans had been identified among the victims.\n\nZurich police search for gunman after shooting at mosque; at least 3 injured\n\nLast week, German prosecutors said a\u00a012-year-old boy attempted to set off a nail bomb at a Christmas market in the southern city of Ludwigshafen.\n\nThe German-born son of Iraqi parents is alleged to have tried to set off the device at the Christmas market on Nov. 26, and again outside city hall on Dec. 5, Focus magazine reported, citing security sources.\n\nIn the second failed attempt, a passer-by spotted the backpack containing the device and reported it to authorities. Inside they found a glass jar packed with firecrackers with nails taped to it, Focus reported.\n\nPolice said it would have burned but would not have exploded.\n\nFox News' Matt Dean and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.45277500152588, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 953, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 16, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.47398356341, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 3, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.30220356768101, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/02/obama-to-give-farewell-address-next-week-in-hometown-chicago.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Obama to give farewell address next week in hometown Chicago", "wordcount_as_scraped": 802, "date": "20170102160000", "story_content": "President Obama will deliver a farewell speech next week in his hometown of Chicago that he says will follow a tradition set in 1796 when first U.S President George Washington spoke to the American people for the last time in office.\n\n\"I'm thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you've changed this country for the better these past eight years, and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here,\" Obama said in an email Monday to supporters.\n\nThe \"speech will take place at McCormick Place, a giant convention center in Chicago.\n\nObama returned to Washington on Monday from Hawaii. And with his last presidential vacation now behind him, the two-term president, entering the closing stretch of his presidency, is on an eleventh-hour push to tie up loose ends and put finishing touches on his legacy before handing the reins to President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nWith just two-and-a-half weeks left, Obama's final days will largely be consumed by a bid to protect his endangered health care law, a major farewell speech and the ongoing handover of power to Trump.\n\nObama's chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan, traveled with Obama to Hawaii and spent much of the trip working on the speech. The Chicago trip will likely be Obama's last outside Washington as president and will be include a \"family reunion\" for Obama's former campaign staffers.\n\nObama is also planning last-minute commutations and pardons, White House officials said, in line with his second-term effort to cut sentences for inmates given unduly harsh sentences for drug crimes. Though prominent offenders like Edward Snowden and Rod Blagojevich are also asking for leniency, Obama's final acts of clemency are expected to remain focused on drug offenders whose plight Obama tried but failed to address through criminal justice reform.\n\nAfter taking office eight years ago, Obama and his aides were effusive in their praise for how Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, helped his team take over the massive federal bureaucracy. Obama has vowed to pass on the favor to Trump. But the transition hasn't been without incident.\n\nThe two teams have clashed over the Trump team's requests for information Obama aides fear could be used to eliminate government employees who worked on Obama priorities like climate change and minority rights overseas. Trump's team, meanwhile, has been frustrated by Obama's attempts to box Trump in with parting moves to block ocean drilling, declare new monuments and further empty out the Guantanamo Bay prison.\n\nWhile on his annual vacation in Oahu, Obama asserted himself forcefully on two foreign policy issues that put him in direct conflict with Trump. Obama directed the U.S. to defy tradition by allowing a U.N. Security Council resolution criticizing Israel on settlements to pass, then slapped Russia with sweeping penalties over U.S. allegations of hacking.\n\nThe final days are Obama's last chance to define his presidency before his loses the bully pulpit and cedes his legacy to historians. For Obama, helping Americans understand how his two terms have reshaped American life is even more critical amid concerns that Trump may undo much of what he accomplished, including the health law.\n\nAs Trump and Republicans vow to gut the Affordable Care Act, Democrats are working to devise a strategy to protect the law by exploiting GOP divisions about how to replace it. To that end, Obama will travel Wednesday to the Capitol to meet with House and Senate Democrats, likely his last meeting with his party's lawmakers as president.\n\nHis administration is also working feverishly to finish up regulations in the pipeline that Obama hopes can be completed in the final days, perhaps increasing the likelihood his policies carry over. But the closer it gets to Trump's inauguration, the harder those tasks become.\n\nThough Obama remains president until Jan. 20, the White House can't process the departure of all its staffers on a single day. So this week Obama aides will start \"offloading,\" turning in their Blackberries and shutting down their computers for the last time, leaving a smaller staff on hand for the final days.\n\nObama must also prepare to become a private citizen for the first time in two decades. An office of the former president must be stood up, and Obama's family will be making arrangements to move into a rental home in Northwest Washington where they plan to stay until youngest daughter Sasha finishes high school.\n\nThe Obamas have long lamented how the presidency denied them freedom and privacy, with first lady Michelle Obama likening the White House to \"a really nice prison.\" But on their last Hawaii vacation, the first family took time out to visit Breakout Waikiki, where visitors are \"trapped\" in a room together and must try, as a team, to escape.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.29870128631592, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 784, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.57909448819, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170102160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.08163265306122, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2016/12/27/carrie-fisher-best-known-as-princess-leia-in-star-wars-dead-at-60.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 631, "scraper_regex": 819}}, "headline": "Carrie Fisher, best known as Princess Leia in Star Wars, dead at 60", "wordcount_as_scraped": 819, "date": "20161227190000", "story_content": "Carrie Fisher, best known as the iconic double-bun hairdo-wearing Princess Leia in the Star Wars franchise, died Tuesday following a heart attack, FoxNews.com confirmed. She was 60.\n\n\"It is with a very deep sadness that Billie Lourd confirms that her beloved mother Carrie Fisher passed away at 8:55 this morning,\" a representative for Lourd told FoxNews.com. \"She was loved by the world and she will be missed profoundly.\"\n\nFisher's publicist also confirmed the news.\n\nSLIDESHOW: CARRIE FISHER THROUGH THE YEARS\n\nFisher starred in a host of popular 1980s movies, was married or engaged to famous singers and actors, suffered from bipolar disorder and drug addiction and eventually became a mental health advocate. She had a medical emergency while on a flight from London to Los Angeles on Dec. 23, during which she stopped breathing. She was later taken to an intensive care unit, but never recovered.\n\n\"Thank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter,\" mother Debbie Reynolds wrote on Facebook. \"I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop. Love Carries Mother.\"\n\nFisher was born on Oct. 21, 1956 with showbiz \u2013 literally \u2013 in her blood. The daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and Reynolds, a star actress, Carrie appeared, at the age of 15, in the Broadway show \"Irene,\" which Reynolds starred in. But the theater turn cost her school time and contributed to Fisher never finishing high school.\n\nShe first appeared on the movie screen in 1975's \"Shampoo,\" though her career took off when she was cast as Princess Leia Organa in the inaugural Star Wars film, which was released in 1977. She would go on to reprise the role in subsequent films, most recently appearing in 2015's \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\"\n\nFisher revealed in her 2016 autobiography that she had an affair with \"Star Wars\" co-star Harrison Ford for three months in 1976.\n\nIn the 1980s, Fisher appeared in a string of Hollywood hits, including \"The Blues Brothers,\" \"Hannah and Her Sisters,\" \"The 'Burbs\" and \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\"\n\nHer romantic life also heated up during the decade. Fisher dated Paul Simon until 1983 and about a year later married to the singer/songwriter, again for about a year. In between stints with Simon, she dated and was briefly engaged to \"Blues Brother\" co-star Dan Akroyd in 1980. She had a child, Billie Catherine Lourd, in 1992 with talent agent Bryan Lourd, though Lourd later left Fisher for a man.\n\nSTARS REACT TO CARRIE FISHER'S DEATH\n\nFisher appeared to reflect on the relationship with Lourd in her 2004 book, \"The Best Awful There Is,\" in which the character Suzanne is loosely based on Fisher's life. \"She'd had a child with someone who forgot to tell her he was gay. He forgot to tell her, and she forgot to notice.\"\n\n\"Best Awful\" was the fifth and final of Fisher's novels, though she later wrote three non-fiction works, including 2016's \"The Princess Diarist.\" A talented writer, she helped rework screen plays for \"Sister Act,\" \"Last Action Hero\" and \"The Wedding Singer.\"\n\nFisher also continued her acting career later in life, often appearing as herself in comedic turns on television shows. Somewhat out of character, she provided the voice of \"Angela\" on \"Family Guy\" from 2005-2016. Her last projects were in two yet-to-be released films: \"Wonderwall\" and as Leia in \"Star Wars: Episode VIII.\"\n\nFisher also publicly struggled with bipolar disorder and abused pain killers and cocaine. She said in 2008 that she received electroconvulsive therapy treatments every six weeks at one point. Fisher became an outspoken advocate for those battling mental illness and received an Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism from Harvard in 2016.\n\n\"I find it unappealing,\" Fisher said of her mental illness in a 2004 Los Angeles Times profile. \"But there is a part of this illness that is funny. I don't understand the stigma. I understand funny. It is what I do. Because I have the sense of humor I have, things don't prey on me long. And that's why I have it. If I didn't, I would be\u2026in pain. If my life weren't funny, it would just be true, and that would be unacceptable.\"\n\nIn her book \"Wishful Drinking,\" Fisher wrote the beginning of her ideal obituary. The remark came as the punchline to an anecdote about \"Star Wars\" director George Lucas telling Fisher that Princess Leia couldn't wear a bra in space -- because, by his logic, it would kill the character.\n\n\"I think that this would make for a fantastic obituary,\" she wrote. \"I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.\"\n\nEddie Fisher died in 2010. Carrie Fisher is survived by her brother, Todd Fisher, and her mother and daughter.\n\nFoxNews.com's Sasha Savitsky contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.1283497810363798, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 631, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 10, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.9005556606400003, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8526148969889102, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/08/iraqis-investigate-decapitated-bodies-in-mass-grave-near-isis-held-mosul.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 621, "scraper_regex": 661}}, "headline": "Iraqis investigate decapitated bodies in mass grave near ISIS-held Mosul", "wordcount_as_scraped": 661, "date": "20161108170000", "story_content": "Iraqi investigators were probing a mass grave on Tuesday discovered by troops advancing on the Islamic State-held city of Mosul, where soldiers have captured a sliver of land but later halted their advance.\n\nIt appeared to be the latest of several mass graves found in territory retaken from IS, which massacred hundreds of people as it swept across northern and central Iraq in 2014 and is believed to have waged a brutal crackdown since the start of the Mosul offensive.\n\nAMERICAN VOLUNTEER MEDICS TREAT CASUALTIES OF MOSUL FIGHT\n\nAssociated Press footage from the site shows bones and decomposed bodies among scraps of clothing and plastic bags dug out of the ground by a bulldozer after Iraqi troops noticed the strong smell while advancing into the town of Hamam al-Alil on Monday.\n\n\"Investigators flew in this morning and are on their way to the grave to conduct examinations and determine the cause of death,\" said Haider Majeed, a Cabinet official in charge of mass grave investigations.\n\nFIVE ISIS SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN GERMANY\n\nThe first officials at the site said the grave, behind an earthen embankment near an agricultural college, likely holds about 100 bodies, many of them decapitated. The town lies some 19 miles from Mosul.\n\nIt was unclear who the victims were, but a soldier at the site pulled a child's stuffed animal from the scraps of clothing and rotting flesh, swarming with flies.\n\nIn Geneva, the U.N. human rights office said it was investigating whether the discovery at Hamam al-Alil was connected to reports about the alleged killing of police officers in the same area.\n\n\"We had reports that 50 former Iraqi police officers had been killed in a building outside Mosul,\" spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said. \"This building was actually the same agricultural facility, agricultural college, that has been cited right now as the site of these mass graves.\"\n\nShe said the U.N. had received reports alleging that IS last week abducted at least 295 former security forces personnel from villages around the northwestern town of Tal Afar, as well as the western Mawaly village area. The men's fate is currently unknown.\n\nSome 30 sheikhs were also reportedly taken from the Sinjar district, with one report saying that over half of them were killed. IS allegedly forcibly moved about 1,500 families to Mosul airport from Hamam al-Alil, she added.\n\nThe campaign to drive IS fighters from Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and the extremists' last major urban stronghold in the country, began on Oct. 17.\n\nIraqi troops and Kurdish peshmerga forces are now converging on Mosul, although the deepest advance into an eastern sliver of the city has stalled after militants counterattacked from built-up, populated areas.\n\nTo the northeast, some 13 kilometers (8 miles) from the city, the peshmerga continued their push on the town of Bashiqa, believed to be largely deserted except for dozens of IS fighters.\n\nMortar fire, automatic weapons, and explosions rang out through the morning, as a thick plume of smoke hung over parts of the town, obscuring the view of aircraft.\n\nThe United Nations says over 34,000 people have been displaced from Mosul, with about three quarters settled in camps and the rest in host communities.\n\nIn a report issued overnight, the U.N. human rights office said food, water and medicine have been distributed to more than 41,000 displaced people and vulnerable residents fleeing the fighting.\n\nSince the battle for Mosul reached the city itself on Nov. 4, some 11,000 people have fled eastwards, while some electricity and water supplies have been cut in eastern neighborhoods.\n\nIn Baghdad, meanwhile, small-scale bombings killed at least eight people and wounded 28 others, according to police and medical officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to brief reporters.\n\nThe capital has seen near-daily bombings since the Mosul operation began, but no large-scale attacks. The bombings are believed to have been carried out by IS, which has frequently targeted Iraq's security forces and Shiite majority.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.933429718017581, "HarmVice": 10, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 621, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.8108408788599997, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161108170000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.3816425120772897, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/18/trump-staff-picks-disappoint-alarm-minority-groups.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Trump's staff picks disappoint, alarm minority groups", "wordcount_as_scraped": 775, "date": "20161118220000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump's choices for leadership posts threaten national unity and promise to turn back the clock on progress for racial, religious and sexual minorities, civil rights leaders and others said Friday after his nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general.\n\nComments attributed to Trump's picks, also including alt-right architect Stephen Bannon as senior adviser and chief strategist and former Army Lt. Michael Flynn as national security adviser, serve to embolden everyday Americans to lash out at members of minority groups, they said.\n\nSessions, of Alabama, was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 after hearings in which he was accused of making racially charged remarks as a U.S. attorney. According to transcripts, Sessions was accused, among other things, of joking that he thought the Ku Klux Klan \"was OK\" until he learned they smoked marijuana, and of calling a black assistant U.S. attorney \"boy.\" During the hearing, Sessions denied making some of the comments and said others were jokes taken out of context.\n\n\"Every American should be concerned about the direction of the U.S. Department of Justice and oppose any nominee who threatens to turn back the clock on civil rights by 50 years,\" said National Urban League President Marc Morial.\n\nBannon led the Breitbart website, which has widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. In a 2011 radio interview, he said conservative women infuriated liberals because they \"would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children,\" contrasting that against a slur for lesbians.\n\nTrump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway has called the accusations against Bannon \"very unfair.\"\n\nLennie Gerber, an 80-year-old resident of High Point, North Carolina, who led the fight against her state's ban on same-sex marriage, said she worried Trump's appointments will further incite such sentiments among the public.\n\n\"Saying that kind of thing incites the racism and the anti-gay feelings in everybody else and says you're free to express these things,\" Gerber said. \"These people who've been suppressed by the positive transformation that has gone on over the last few years are now feeling free to express themselves.\"\n\nCivil rights leaders are calling on Trump to rescind Sessions' nomination or for the Senate to reject him. Sessions requires Senate confirmation as attorney general, as does Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director, but Bannon and Flynn do not.\n\nIn August, Flynn spoke at an event in Dallas for the anti-Islamist group Act for America, calling Islam, a religion with 1.6 billion adherents, \"a political ideology\" and \"a cancer.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, these very important picks in his administration send a troubling message indicating that the bigotry we saw expressed in the campaign will continue,\" said Ibrahim Hooper, spokesperson for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nAside from comments and actions attributed to the nominees, their lack of diversity worries civil rights leaders. Trump has said he planned to reward loyalty, and demonstrated such with his nomination of Sessions, who was the first senator to endorse him.\n\nWashington attorney A. Scott Bolden said Trump is \"0 for 4\" on diversity. All four of his picks so far are white men.\n\n\"The scariest part of his potential administration will be how his political debts to the alt-right will manifest itself in his administration and policies,\" Bolden said. \"Jeff Sessions is one of those manifestations ... to be in control not only of justice in America, but really to bring injustice to America.\"\n\nIn Congress, Sessions is seen as an immigration hardliner \u2014 an issue that connected him with Trump early in the campaign \u2014 and his policies stand in opposition to the Latino community, said Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, an advocacy group.\n\n\"These divisive individuals belie Trump's statement that he wants to unite Americans,\" she said.\n\nThe Rev. Jeffrey Brown, associate pastor of the Twelfth Baptist Church in Boston, said he is not happy with Trump's choices so far, particularly Sessions.\n\n\"I hear people complaining that we should give the Trump administration a chance,\" Brown said. \"It's very clear by his appointments that he's not going to give a lot of communities in the United States that same chance.\"\n\nElaine Walton, an African-American resident of New Orleans, said she had deep concerns. Her most visceral reaction to Trump's picks? \"Fear.

Their room was fouled by human waste and one boy with Down syndrome was found wearing a soiled diaper. None attended school.\n\nAlready, Gov. Greg Abbott, lawmakers, experts and advocates have said the troubled, understaffed Child Protective Services' agency is in need of a broader overhaul, with the Legislature giving it nearly $150 million in special emergency funding to hire 800 workers. That could close a hole in oversight revealed by the Houston-area case, as state caseworkers don't do follow-up visits once an adoption is completed unless a complaint is lodged.\n\nThe case wasn't publicized until Monday, with officials saying detectives needed time to pursue a complicated investigation. The Nov. 22 discovery of the teens \u2014 ages 14 to 16 \u2014 was shocking to the community of Richmond, which is southwest of Houston, according to Ruthanne Mefford, chief executive of Child Advocates of Fort Bend.\n\n\"If we're going to prevent this in the future we need to think about a system-wide program where we can ensure children are protected and safe, even when the adoption closes,\" Mefford said.\n\nMefford's agency interviewed the teens after they were removed from the home and will represent them as the case proceeds against the two people arrested in the matter \u2014 their adoptive mother, Paula Sinclair, and husband Allen Richardson, 78.\n\nSinclair and a former husband adopted the children in 2003 and 2004 and had been their foster parents, Texas Department of Family and Protective Services spokeswoman Tiffani Butler said.\n\nCPS went to the home in 2011 when a 7-year-old boy with cerebral palsy who was blind and mute died there. Authorities ruled the death a result of natural causes. After that, caseworkers didn't visit until one received a tip last month.\n\nButler said caseworkers normally would not visit a home once an adoption is completed unless they receive a complaint of abuse or neglect \u2014 something Mefford believes needs to change. She wants to see mandated, periodic visits to adoptive homes.\n\n\"One of the things that is a red flag is that these children never went to school,\" she said.\n\nShe also wants a child-protection network as a continuing resource to parents, a notion supported by Dimple Patel, a senior policy analyst for The Texas Association for the Protection of Children, a nonpartisan agency that works to prevent abuse.\n\n\"I don't think we spend enough time with families after adoption,\" said Patel, noting that disruptions can arise years after an adoption is completed.\n\nShe adds that CPS, which is beset by low morale and high turnover, needs to have seasoned workers with manageable workloads who are skilled in doing investigations.\n\nSinclair and Richardson are jailed in Fort Bend County; records don't indicate whether they have attorneys. A 2007 Houston Chronicle story shows Sinclair started a charity to raise money for the children's care. It lost its nonprofit status in 2012 after failing to file required forms.\n\n\"I just couldn't see these children doing well in the foster care system, because they were so badly injured and had so many special needs,\" she told the newspaper. \"I feel like this is what God called me to do \u2014 to take care of these babies.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.59146332740784, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 587, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.1648900337299994, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161210160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.25894378194208, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/05/russian-field-hospital-hit-in-syrias-aleppo-nurse-killed.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 537, "scraper_regex": 999}}, "headline": "Two Russian nurses killed in rebel shelling of Syria's Aleppo", "wordcount_as_scraped": 999, "date": "20161205140000", "story_content": "Rebel shelling killed two Russian nurses and eight civilians Monday in Aleppo, and a Russian fighter jet crashed as it was returning to an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean after a sortie over Syria, but the pilot ejected safely, Moscow officials said.\n\nThe shelling that targeted government-controlled western Aleppo was one of the most intense in recent days. It coincided with a crushing air and ground assault that has seen forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad recapture more than half of opposition-held eastern Aleppo.\n\nRussia and militias allied with Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah have been staunch supporters of Assad in his country's bitter civil war, now in its sixth year.\n\nThe shelling initially killed one female nurse and wounded two Russian medics working in a field hospital, a Russian officer told reporters in the northern city.

The Russians have tried before to coax rebels into leaving the territory, setting up corridors out of the district, but the fighters have refused because they want to retain their control over parts of the city. Some fear the Russians and their Syrian allies would not ensure their safety.\n\nMonday's fighting was the worst in days. Syrian government artillery, tanks and warplanes pounded rebel-held parts of the city for hours. The airstrikes were so intense that buildings on the western side of the city shook. Opposition activists and rescue workers said four people were killed in a barrel bomb attack on a rebel-held district, and three more were trapped in the rubble.\n\nInsurgents also struck back in the government-held western parts of the city with dozens of mortar shells.

The shelling struck shortly before the inauguration of makeshift clinic. The AP crew was accompanied by representatives of the Syrian army.\n\nKonashenkov said an unspecified number of residents at the field hospital were wounded, and he accused the U.S., Britain and France of telling the rebels the location of the hospital.\n\n\"The blood of our soldiers is on the hands of those who ordered this murder -- those who created, nurtured and armed these beasts in human form and named them the `opposition,\"' he said.\n\nAsked about the accusation, the British Defense Ministry declined to comment.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry also said the Su-33 fighter jet crashed in the Mediterranean as it returned to the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov after a sortie over Syria. \"Because of the failure of the arrester system's cable, the Su-33 fighter rolled off the deck,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe pilot ejected successfully and was unharmed, the ministry said, adding that Russian military operations over Syria would not be affected by the incident.\n\nThis is the second loss of an aircraft from the Admiral Kuznetsov since it arrived off Syria last month. A MiG-29 crashed into the sea Nov. 15 while trying to land on the carrier.\n\nIn a ground offensive that began last week, Syrian government forces seized large parts of the Aleppo enclave that have been under rebel control since 2012. Monday's fighting was most intense near the dividing line between eastern and western Aleppo as government and allied troops pushed their way from the eastern flank, reaching less than 1 kilometer (half a mile) from the citadel in the center of the city.\n\nRebel fighters clashed with advancing troops and also lobbed mortars and shells into the government-controlled part of Aleppo to the west.\n\nThe opposition-run Thiqa News agency and the Syrian Civil Defense said four civilians were killed in the rebel-held Zabadiyeh district when barrel bombs were dropped there.\n\nIn nearby rebel-controlled Idlib province, Syrian opposition activists said Russian and Syrian aircraft stepped up assaults, a day after air raids killed more than 60 people.\n\nThe activist-run Local Coordination Committees said airstrikes on Monday hit the towns of Binnish, Maarat Nasaan and Saraqib, as well as the provincial capital, Idlib. The network said three children were killed, blaming the attacks on Russian aircraft.\n\nRebels also sent rockets into the predominantly Shiite towns of Foua and Kfarya, in Idlib province. Online video posted by activists showed clouds of smoke rising and wreckage sustained by the blasts.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 288 civilians have been killed in the province since Oct. 20, when Syrian government and Russian aircraft intensified airstrikes. The Syrian Civil Defense in Idlib said 65 civilians were killed in Sunday's airstrikes across the province, including attacks on two rural marketplaces that killed dozens.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.16351127624512, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 537, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 19, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.38132675889, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.84171322160149, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/28/im-democrat-but-heres-how-hillary-and-recount-campaign-leaves-me-feeling.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1062]}}, "headline": "I'm a Democrat. Here's how Hillary and the recount campaign leaves me feeling", "wordcount_as_scraped": 822, "date": "20161128170000", "story_content": "Saturday, Hillary Clinton announced that she had joined a recount effort in at least three Midwestern states, questioning whether \"an accurate vote\" will be reported to the Electoral College. This comes on the heels of a concession speech where she told her supporters that, \"We must accept this result\u2026 Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\"\n\nHours after Clinton delivered her remarks, President Obama joined his nominee in asking the same of the country \u2013 and my Democratic party. It was a moment of pride for many Americans. We could celebrate a peaceful transition of power, even if we didn't like the result.\n\nMORE FROM OPINION: COOLIDGE, IMMIGRATION AND US\n\nIt's now clear that Clinton's speech wasn't genuine. According to her campaign, they've had lawyers, data scientists and analysts combing over election results starting \"the day after the election,\" or the day of her otherwise thoughtful concession speech. Their goal:\u00a0 find evidence that would suggest a hacked result, despite the president \u2013 and my former colleagues in the intelligence community \u2013 stating clearly that there are no signs of foreign tampering at the ballot box.\n\nWhy would Clinton do this? Some suggest it's a vengeful ploy to make Trump look illegitimate in the eyes of the American people. But I suspect that this is the last, embarrassing gasp of a flailing politician, unable to accept defeat with grace.\n\nAs a Democrat, I am frustrated and ashamed. Unlike Clinton, I realize that America's history was built not just on its gallant winners but also on its noble losers.\n\nClinton is not the first Democrat from New York to lose the presidency after winning the popular vote. That honor goes to Samuel Tilden during his disputed election of 1876. At the time, Tilden's supporters were utterly convinced that his opponent \u2013 President-elect Rutherford B. Hayes \u2013 would bring about the end of the nation. As one voter put it: \"Goodbye free government, free elections, free speech, and free press, as well as all civil liberties.\"\n\nThe media response was no less breathless. Newspaper titan and fellow Democrat Joseph Pulitzer \u2013 of Pulitzer Prize fame \u2013 called for 100,000 armed Tilden supporters to storm Washington D.C.\n\nThankfully, cooler heads prevailed; Tilden was not one to foment a revolution. He gave a respectful concession speech and retired to New York.\n\nPerhaps in the back of Tilden's mind was another great American loser, General Robert E. Lee. Just before his surrender at Appomattox near the end of the Civil War, Lee's chief of artillery \u2013 General Porter Alexander \u2013 proposed that the Southern army collapse into bands of guerilla fighters, continuing the war until an exhausted North finally conceded. Lee refused, eloquently summarizing why the South had to accept defeat.\n\n\"You and I as Christian men have no right to consider only how this would affect us. We must consider its effect on the country as a whole. Already it is demoralized by the four years of war. If I took your advice, the men\u2026would be compelled to rob and steal in order to live. They would become mere bands of marauders\u2026 We would bring on a state of affairs [that] would take the country years to recover from.\"\n\nLee surrendered the next day.\n\nIn politics and war, the lesson is clear: American patriots aren't always the winners. Indeed, how we lose sets the example for what it means to win. Tilden could have led an army to D.C. \u2013 he won the popular vote. Lee could have opened the gates of hell and secured a Southern victory. But both men understood something of far greater consequence: the American republic is worth more than ego or ambition.\n\nWith Clinton's embrace of an electoral recount, it is clear that she cannot accept defeat with grace, nor does she hold our nation in the same regard as Tilden or Lee. That means my fellow Americans \u2013 and especially my fellow Democrats \u2013 must stand up to her hubris. We must make clear that we offer no excuses for our loss. We will not chase the ghosts of foreign hackers. We won't be fooled by FBI conspiracies, blame bad campaign staff, whine about false Facebook posts, or blame mobs of deplorables.\n\nNo, we realize that we lost because the nation wanted change and our candidate was too flawed and untrustworthy to carry that mantle.\n\nAnd so we will work with President-elect Trump to make America great again. When his solutions make sense, he will have our vote. When he loses his way, we will hold him accountable. In short, we will be a faithful opposition; we will offer better solutions. That is how America works, even if it's not the America that Hillary Clinton wants us to be.\n\n\n\nBryan Dean Wright is a former CIA ops officer and member of the Democratic Party.

Jeff Sessions for attorney general.\n\nComments attributed to Trump's picks, also including alt-right architect Stephen Bannon as senior adviser and chief strategist and former Army Lt. Michael Flynn as national security adviser, serve to embolden everyday Americans to lash out at members of minority groups, they said.\n\nSessions, of Alabama, was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 after hearings in which he was accused of making racially charged remarks as a U.S. attorney. According to transcripts, Sessions was accused, among other things, of joking that he thought the Ku Klux Klan \"was OK\" until he learned they smoked marijuana, and of calling a black assistant U.S. attorney \"boy.\" During the hearing, Sessions denied making some of the comments and said others were jokes taken out of context.\n\n\"Every American should be concerned about the direction of the U.S. Department of Justice and oppose any nominee who threatens to turn back the clock on civil rights by 50 years,\" said National Urban League President Marc Morial.\n\nBannon led the Breitbart website, which has widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. In a 2011 radio interview, he said conservative women infuriated liberals because they \"would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children,\" contrasting that against a slur for lesbians.\n\nTrump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway has called the accusations against Bannon \"very unfair.\"\n\nLennie Gerber, an 80-year-old resident of High Point, North Carolina, who led the fight against her state's ban on same-sex marriage, said she worried Trump's appointments will further incite such sentiments among the public.\n\n\"Saying that kind of thing incites the racism and the anti-gay feelings in everybody else and says you're free to express these things,\" Gerber said. \"These people who've been suppressed by the positive transformation that has gone on over the last few years are now feeling free to express themselves.\"\n\nCivil rights leaders are calling on Trump to rescind Sessions' nomination or for the Senate to reject him. Sessions requires Senate confirmation as attorney general, as does Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director, but Bannon and Flynn do not.\n\nIn August, Flynn spoke at an event in Dallas for the anti-Islamist group Act for America, calling Islam, a religion with 1.6 billion adherents, \"a political ideology\" and \"a cancer.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, these very important picks in his administration send a troubling message indicating that the bigotry we saw expressed in the campaign will continue,\" said Ibrahim Hooper, spokesperson for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nAside from comments and actions attributed to the nominees, their lack of diversity worries civil rights leaders. Trump has said he planned to reward loyalty, and demonstrated such with his nomination of Sessions, who was the first senator to endorse him.\n\nWashington attorney A. Scott Bolden said Trump is \"0 for 4\" on diversity. All four of his picks so far are white men.\n\n\"The scariest part of his potential administration will be how his political debts to the alt-right will manifest itself in his administration and policies,\" Bolden said. \"Jeff Sessions is one of those manifestations ... to be in control not only of justice in America, but really to bring injustice to America.\"\n\nIn Congress, Sessions is seen as an immigration hardliner \u2014 an issue that connected him with Trump early in the campaign \u2014 and his policies stand in opposition to the Latino community, said Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, an advocacy group.\n\n\"These divisive individuals belie Trump's statement that he wants to unite Americans,\" she said.\n\nThe Rev. Jeffrey Brown, associate pastor of the Twelfth Baptist Church in Boston, said he is not happy with Trump's choices so far, particularly Sessions.\n\n\"I hear people complaining that we should give the Trump administration a chance,\" Brown said. \"It's very clear by his appointments that he's not going to give a lot of communities in the United States that same chance.\"\n\nElaine Walton, an African-American resident of New Orleans, said she had deep concerns. Her most visceral reaction to Trump's picks? \"Fear. How is he going to be the top watchdog for the country when he's so biased?\"\n\n\"I think those people cannot lead him, advise him on how to lead this country forward,\" she said. \"They are going to advise him on how to lead the country backwards.\"\n\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.3962264060974103, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 734, "FairnessVirtue": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.33322737739, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161119190000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 4, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.0408719346049, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/11/fierce-battles-leave-hospital-in-iraqi-city-mosul-gutted.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [73]}}, "headline": "Fierce battles leave hospital in Iraqi city of Mosul gutted", "wordcount_as_scraped": 889, "date": "20170111070000", "story_content": "MOSUL, Iraq \u2013 \u00a0After weeks of airstrikes and artillery fire, Mosul's al-Salam hospital is little more than a burnt-out shell. Retaken from the Islamic State group by Iraqi forces this month, the building's top floors were almost completely destroyed. The gardens around the complex are strewn with medical records and supplies. Bright blue hospital bedsheets hang from nearby trees.\n\nThe hospital in eastern Mosul was the scene of one of the most significant setbacks for Iraqi troops in the nearly 3-month operation to retake Iraq's second-largest city. On Dec. 6, after advancing too quickly, Iraqi forces found themselves surrounded by IS fighters in the hospital complex. Pummeled by wave upon wave of militant counterattacks, dozens were killed and wounded, according to Iraqi military and hospital officials, eventually forcing a withdrawal.\n\nSome Iraqi army officers blamed the setback on insufficient air support by the U.S.-led coalition. Others faulted poor leadership and a lack of coordination among the many disparate Iraqi forces participating in the Mosul offensive, including tribal and militia fighters who maintain their own command structures.\n\nFollowing the December withdrawal, Iraq's elite rapid-response unit joined the Iraqi army on Mosul's southeast front and the U.S.-led coalition increased its air campaign, despite an initial reluctance to use airstrikes against IS in the vicinity of the hospital.\n\nOver the past month, coalition planes dropped 25 bombs on the hospital complex, according to a Pentagon statement provided to The Associated Press. After weeks of static front lines, the renewed air and ground assault brought Iraqi forces to the edge of the Tigris River. Since the Mosul operation was launched in October, Iraqi forces have slowly clawed back about a third of the city.\n\n\"We have more experience in urban areas,\" said Brig. Gen. Mehdi Abbas Abdullah, a commander of the rapid-response unit, explaining why his forces were able to eventually retake the hospital. Before joining the Mosul fight, he led men in Fallujah and Khaldiya in Iraq's Anbar province.\n\nBut one of his men said air power rather than ground forces played the key role.\n\n\"Honestly, the battle was 75 percent fought from the air,\" said Sgt. Maj. Hassan Ali Jalil, acknowledging the military's continued reliance on coalition airstrikes despite months of coalition training.\n\nThe Iraqi army's 9th division, which led the fight for the hospital until being forced to withdraw last month, is an armored unit designed to fight on open terrain rather than in dense urban environments.\n\nOn Tuesday, half a dozen destroyed Iraqi army tanks filled a parking lot beside the hospital. The large, cumbersome vehicles were captured by the IS fighters who were moving around the battlefield, across rooftops and through tunnels connecting the basements of buildings.\n\nThe commander of the 9th division, Lt. Gen. Qassim Jassim Nazal, visited the hospital complex Tuesday for the first time since he was forced to withdraw last month. Walking past the bombed-out buildings, he asked to be shown the destroyed vehicles left behind by his unit.\n\n\"This is like a revenge to return to this place,\" said Nazal, adding that his men were unable to fight back against the IS fighters and the waves of car bombs they unleashed without heavy air support. \"They were not normal car bombs. Each one was like an atomic blast,\" he said.\n\nThe hospital basement had been transformed into an IS bunker. Dozens of mattresses filled rooms, ammunition and body armor lined hallways and Islamic religious texts were piled atop shelves. There was no evidence to suggest the complex was being used as a hospital to treat civilians at the time of the attack: medical records viewed by an AP team at the scene were dated more than a year ago.\n\nCoalition spokesman U.S. Army Col. John Dorrian said it was \"clear\" the hospital was being used by IS as a headquarters and was no longer being used as a facility to treat civilians.\n\n\"If the enemy is going to use facilities like (hospitals) as a storage place for weapons or as an operations headquarters, we will strike those kinds of facilities,\" Dorrian said, adding that the practice is consistent with the laws of armed conflict.\n\nRetaking the hospital has allowed Iraqi forces to punch deeper into Mosul and reach the edge of the Tigris River that divides the city's east and west.\n\nThe city's Yarimjah neighborhood, just a few hundred yards (meters) from the banks of the Tigris, is now the front line in the Mosul fight. Children played in its narrow streets on Tuesday, scattering and hiding at the sound of mortars and rockets flying overhead.\n\n\"We learned what that sound means,\" said 13-year-old Hamid Mahmood, playing in front of his home with his younger brothers.\n\nOver the past three months, Saif Ahmed, 23, estimates that more than 30 people from his neighborhood alone have died in the clashes between Iraqi troops and IS fighters. In just the past week, his family has buried his sister-in-law and her infant daughter. The woman was killed in a mortar attack. Days later, her 10-day-old baby died after contracting diarrhea.\n\nIraqi Capt. Mazin Mohammad, stationed in Yarimjah, said Iraqi forces there are especially vulnerable to mortar attacks because of the open fields separating his men from IS positions on the far bank of the Tigris.\n\n\"It's an open area and they can see us coming,\" he said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.52016973495483, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 847, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 15, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.209395237380001, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170111070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.47933884297521, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/27/wisconsin-family-threatened-forced-to-move-after-neighbor-flies-nazi-flag.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [273, 1612, 2729, 2738]}}, "headline": "Wisconsin family threatened, forced to move after neighbor flies Nazi flag", "wordcount_as_scraped": 645, "date": "20170127200000", "story_content": "A Wisconsin family of six is being forced to move after their duplex neighbor put up a Nazi flag in a sign of protest against President Trump and a viral photo brought angry strangers to their door. \u00a0\n\nThe Diaz family's troubles began when a passerby snapped a photo of the two-story Oshkosh duplex on Saturday and posted it on social media.

We have offered to let her out of her lease,\" Grant Schwab, owner of Schwab Properties, told Fox News. \"Our biggest concern is their safety. They don't deserve any of this.\"\n\nDiaz created a\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0page, which as of Friday morning had raised about $1,800 in donations, to relocate her family and to pay for her attorney's fees. She plans on suing the person who posted her address on Facebook.\n\n\"I live there with my four young children and my husband who is almost blind,\" she wrote in a statement on the page. \"During this time, numerous threats were made to burn down the whole house [and] to knock on the door and punch people in the face.\"\n\nThe FBI and local police are investigation the threats against Diaz's family. The local FBI field office declined to comment.

Garay sought to stay in the United States under a law that prevents U.S. authorities from sending immigrants to countries where their lives would be threatened because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\n\nGaray argued that former members of his El Salvador gang constituted a \"particular social group,\" and the gang members would kill him if he returned to El Salvador \u2014 possibly by placing a gasoline-filled tire around him and burning it, a method they prefer, he said.\n\nImmigration officials rejected Reyes' claim on the grounds that former gang members do not constitute a particular social group.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals said to qualify as a particular social group, there must be evidence showing that society \"perceives, considers, or recognizes persons sharing the particular characteristic to be a group.\"\n\nGaray's proposed group \u2014 members of the Mara 18 gang in El Salvador who have renounced their gang ties \u2014 was too broad, and there was little evidence society recognized them as a distinct group, the board said. The appeals court panel upheld the decision.\n\nWhile holding that Garay did not automatically qualify to stay in the country, the 9th Circuit resurrected his attempt to avoid deportation under a separate law related to torture. The panel said an immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals were wrong to discount his concerns about being tortured upon his return; the immigration judge's decision even suggested that Garay failed to show he might be tortured, but only killed.\n\n\"We cannot read the (immigration judge's) statement as reflecting anything other than an erroneous view that killings are not torture,\" Judge Consuelo M. Callahan wrote for the panel. She said the case should be sent back to an immigration judge to assess \"whether Garay demonstrated a probability that he would be killed or otherwise tortured.\"\n\nGaray's attorney, Alma David, praised the ruling. \"It's a strong, good decision in that there's now a strong likelihood of being granted relief under the Convention Against Torture,\" David said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.29338121414185, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 518, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.46843844634, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 14, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 42, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161201050000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 8.10810810810811, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/26/new-jerseys-cubans-break-out-champagne-but-also-express-sadness-over-relatives-who-died-before-castro.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [573, 3700], "\u00a0": [123, 7622]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1236, "scraper_regex": 1325}}, "headline": "New Jersey's Cubans break out champagne, but also express sadness over  relatives who died before Castro", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1325, "date": "20161126230000", "story_content": "UNION CITY, N.J. \u2013 \u00a0Norma Edmiston does not normally have champagne with her scrambled eggs at breakfast.\n\nBut on Saturday morning, she did.\n\nHours earlier, news of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death had been announced, and like many Cuban-Americans around the country, Edmiston celebrated the moment she thought would never come.\n\n\"We were waiting for this for a long time,\" Edmiston said to FoxNews.com while she and her husband ate lunch at a popular Cuban caf\u00e9, El Artesano, situated on Bergenline Avenue in Union City \u2013 once a Cuban exile enclave. \"I was on the telephone this morning with friends and family, we were all saying 'Congratulations!' My husband and I knew we had to break out the champagne.\"\n\nSeveral stores along Bergenline Avenue, which in the 1960's saw thousands of Cubans settle there to begin new lives, propped up hand-written signs on their windows saying \"Castro, your hour has come,\" and \"Viva Cuba Libre!.\"\n\nAt El Artesano, where Cubans who long ago moved away to the suburbs \u2013 for bigger homes, better schools and driveways and bigger yards \u2013 often come back for black beans, pork, and other Cuban dishes that taste like they did at home, Fidel Castro was the topic of conversations at nearly every table.\n\nOlder Cubans recalled what the Communist revolution \u2013 what \"Fidel\" \u2013 took away from them, ranging from homes, businesses, possessions and relatives.\n\nYounger Cubans recounted what they had grown up hearing about \"Fidel\" from their parents, and spoke of all the relatives in Cuba they did not know, or know well, because of the separation of families that occurred after the revolution.\n\nAnd many Cubans of all ages said that any positive feelings they had about Fidel Castro's death were tempered by sadness over deceased mothers, fathers, and grandparents who had waited for this day, but did not live to see it.\n\n\"I hope he burns in Hell,\" said Otilea Garcia, an elegantly dressed diminutive woman sitting by herself at one table, having Cuban espresso and an empanada. \"Fidel Castro was Lucifer. They say he supported the struggle against Apartheid, but meanwhile inside Cuba he suppressed his own people, of all races. His death is long overdue.\"\n\nGarcia spoke with visible anger and pain about leaving her father behind in Cuba in 1972 when she decided to flee to the United States with her young son.\n\n\"My father said 'You're taking the most important thing in this world to me,' he was talking about my son,\" said Garcia, as tears welled in her eyes. \"I could not go to Cuba when close relatives died because Castro would not allow us back, not even for funerals. May he rot in Hell.\"\n\nFelix Alfonso, whose family owns El Artesano, thought of his late father, whom the Fidel Castro regime imprisoned for two years for buying a loaf of bread through the black market \u2013 a way that many Cubans, who can afford it, get around Cuba's food rationing.\n\n\"When I heard that Fidel died, it was great news,\" Alfonso said, as he paused for a few minutes from tending to customers in the busy restaurant his parents opened more than 30 years ago. \"It seemed at one point like he would never, ever die, like it would never end. He outlived a lot of people who left Cuba because of him, people like my father and other relatives.\"\n\nTRUMP TWEETS 'CASTRO IS DEAD'\n\n\"You don't want to wish death on anybody,\" he said, \"but what so many Cuban people went through because of Fidel Castro makes them angry\" and hateful towards the former dictator.\n \"On the very day I was born in Cuba, the day my father got a son, he saw Castro's government confiscate his small caf\u00e9 that he had in Matanzas.\"\n\nBut while Alfonso felt the mix of shock and some pleasure over Castro's death that many Cuban-Americans expressed on Saturday, like them, he too said that Cuba's problems did not die with the revolutionary icon.\n\n\"There's still a Castro in power,\" Alfonso said.\n\nEdminton, who left Cuba in 1970 at the age of 15, still felt anger and resentment over being forced by her teachers to write compositions glorifying Fidel Castro and Communism.\n\n\"We had to write about how great the revolution was,\" she said, \"and I did, even though I did not believe that, but you had to do it. I recited all the Communist lines. Before I went to school, my parents would remind me to say good things about Fidel and the revolution, even though within my home we were against him and the government.\"\n\nOne day, when she took a slice of tomato from the school kitchen because she was hungry, the then 7th grader was sent away to labor camp as punishment.\n\nJose Miguel Lobaina, 73, wasn't sure he'd outlive the Cuban leader who himself outlived about 10 U.S. presidents, most of his foes in exile, as well as many of the journalists who had written advance obits of him.\n\nLobaina said he is ecstatic, and feels hope for Cuba's future.\n\n\"This man was arguably smart,\" Lobaina said, \"but he was Machiavellian. He was egomaniacal. His legacy is that he was the root of the social, economic and political destruction of Cuba. But I'll tell you what he failed to destroy \u2013 the hope of the Cuban people. Today the hope of freedom is reborn in Cuba.\"\n\nFernando Villar, 30, grew up hearing about the devastation that Castro's rule had caused.\n\nWhen he heard about his death, he said, \"it was surreal.\"\n\nFORMER CUBAN LEADER FIDEL CASTRO DIES AT 90\n\nVillar expected to be ecstatic when the day of Fidel Castro's death arrived, but he felt somewhat down.\n\nHis father, who had been a political prisoner in Cuba and died two years ago, was not with him to share the news, to reflect on it.\n \"Fidel Castro should be reviled,\" Villar said. \"History should not absolve him.\"\n\nTwo blocks down, at the headquarters of a former Cuban political prisoners group, dozens of men who had served time in Castro's jails for demanding human rights and criticizing the revolution gathered to pay homage to those who died in prison and others who were executed.\n\nThe walls of the space where these exiles, now in their 70's, 80's and 90's, meet every week are lined with black and white photos of those who they say were executed by firing squads in Cuba because of their political beliefs.\n\n\"We decided to gather, not to celebrate Fidel Castro's death, but to remember and honor his victims, whose names are not known like his is, and whose fate most of the world does not know about,\" said Israel Luis Abreu, a founder of the group who spent more than a dozen years in a Cuban jail. \"As we see the praise for this dictator pour in from around the world, we feel obligated to remind everyone aboiut his victims.\"\n\nEvaristo Sotolongo, who spent 17 years in a Cuban jail, said: \"This is our sanctuary, a refuge for those of us who survived this dictator's oppression and brutality. Castro has been a carcass, really, for some time now. We say 'Good riddance,' to him and President Obama, who will be gone in his own way before too long. He gave away too much to Raul Castro without getting a promise of a better life for the Cuban people.\"\n\nSergio Gatria, a longtime anti-Castro activist, pointed to all the photos of the dead that covered the walls.\n\n\"It doesn't bring me joy that this is how it ended for Fidel,\" he said. \"Here's a beast who should have gone to trial for crimes against humanity, who should have gone to jail, or been executed like Saddam Hussein. Instead, he lived a full 90 years, a lot of it in comfort. He died in his home, he never paid the consequences for all the harm he did to so many people, to an entire country.\"\n \u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.036827087402339, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1236, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.34268660197, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161126230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 1.86084142394822, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/science/2016/12/13/family-fights-government-in-land-dispute-near-area-51.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [113, 193, 197, 259, 338, 413, 484, 562, 1115, 1457, 2130, 2448, 2899, 5268, 5355, 5398]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 831, "scraper_regex": 915}}, "headline": "Family fights government in land dispute near Area 51", "wordcount_as_scraped": 915, "date": "20161213140000", "story_content": "Joe Sheahan is in the fight of his life to save his family's\u00a0Nevada mine from being swallowed up by the federal government's mysterious Area\u00a051.\u00a0\n\nTechnically, Sheahan's family no longer even holds title to\u00a0Groom Mine, which it owned for 130 years. The federal government took the deed\u00a0through eminent domain after first offering the Sheahans $333,300, a price\u00a0family lawyer James Leavitt called \"embarrassingly low.\" The family is\u00a0fighting back in federal court, but if the Sheahans and Uncle Sam can't agree\u00a0on a value, it could wind up before a jury.\n\nPossibly more interesting is what the federal government wants with a parched stretch of rural Nevada desert and an old mine that hasn't been active in decades. The area is known for two of the feds' most closely guarded secrets: nuclear testing and UFOs.\n\nSo far, the family has not been paid for the land. Initially, the family was sued by the federal government in September of 2015 in a complaint case of eminent domain. A few days later the government then filed a motion to take the over the property.\u00a0 Now, Appraisal reports are being exchanged in the discovery phase of the litigation. If the parties cannot reach a sufficient value for the land, the Sheahans are prepared to fight it in a jury trial.\n\nThe mine hasn't been in full operation since 1954, but until fall of 2015 family members went out from time to time to blast for minerals.\u00a0 The 400 acres of land sits almost 6,000 feet above sea level with panoramic views of the surrounding Groom Mountain Range and borders the Nevada Test and Training Range, which includes Area 51. According to Sheahan, his family's land had always been highly sought after by the U.S. Air Force base looking to expand its flight-testing range, \"They told me the land was like a suit hemmed in too tight that needed to breathe, that's why they want our land\" Sheahan said.\n\nREAL-LIFE 'X-FILES'? CIA POSTS TROVE OF UFO DOCUMENTS\n\nSheahan told Fox News that Air Force officials started showing up unannounced on the property in the 40's and 50's, intimidating his grandparents.\u00a0 He said his family complained to the Air Force, but nothing happened. Then nuclear tests came without warning. According to the Las Vegas Review Journal archives, on Jan. 27, 1951, the Air Force detonated the first above-ground test on land next to the Groom Mine. Sheahan says his family wasn't told about the test.\u00a0 \"This bomb goes off, who do you call, who do you Google, there's no one \u2026 those blasts did significant damage to the property, not only in radiation,\" he said. Sheahan claims family members and mine workers suffered long-term radiation effects and says some livestock died from beta burns.\n\nIn the winter of 2014, government officials from the Department of Defense and the U.S. Air Force approached the Sheahan family about purchasing the property.\u00a0 At that time, Sheahan and other family members had never had the property appraised but he says the family thought offers of $2.4 million, $5.2 million, and $1.5 million from the Air Force were too low and so they rejected them. \"We're not going to sit down with those numbers at the table.\" said Sheahan.\n\nThe Air Force confiscated the property on Sept. 16, 2015 through a federal court ruling in US District Court in Nevada. The family had three outside experts appraise the property after the seizure. Due to its proximity to Area 51 and the mineral rights to the land, each appraiser recognized the \"unique value\" of the property and came to the conclusion that the real value of the land was worth upwards of $44 million to $116 million dollars, Leavitt told Fox News.\n\nAUSTRALIAN TELESCOPE JOINS $100 MILLION SEARCH FOR ALIEN LIFE\n\nIn a statement on Nov. 9, 2016 obtained by Fox News, a prior commander at Nellis Air Force Base, Col. Thomas E. Dempsey explained the reason for seizing the land; \"Over the years, technology has increased demand for the test and training range assets and the Air Force has developed infrastructure that directly supports range activities that cannot be replicated elsewhere.\"\n\nLeavitt is fighting to get the family just compensation, which real estate expert and Fox News Legal Analyst Bob Massi explains as \"an objective understanding of the value of that property.\"\n\nFox News reached out for a comment from Justice Department, which is representing the Air Force but was told by deputy press secretary Wyn Hornbuckle the department will not comment on pending litigation.\n\n'IT WAS NOT FROM THIS WORLD': WITNESS TO 'BRITAIN'S ROSWELL' UFO INCIDENT BREAKS 36-YEAR SILENCE\n\nFreelance local investigative reporter Glen Meek has been researching the Sheahan case since the government seized the land and is making a documentary about the land dispute. He noted government's unwillingness to provide answers and boiled it down to two major fundamental issues - individual rights and national security, saying \"the government's position is pretty much, the testing that's going on there now is incompatible with civilians having private land in that area.\"\n\nThe case is currently in discovery. Sheahan says he is a God-loving American and does not want to be portrayed as unpatriotic but wants his family to receive just compensation.\u00a0 Sheahan and Leavitt expect a late spring or early summer court date where a jury will\u00a0decide on the matter of just compensation.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAndrew Craft is a Fox News multimedia reporter based in Las Vegas, Nevada .

The photo, they said, was proof of \"ties\" to Hamas.\n\n\"Ludicrous,\" said Sarsour, who was out rallying again Wednesday night in her hometown of New York City, protesting executive orders on immigration and border security signed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe online attacks, Sarsour said, were the work of \"fake news purveyors\" and \"right-wing media outlets recirculating false information.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to be intimidated or silenced,\" the-36-year-old married mother of three said.\n\nSarsour, the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, cut her teeth as an activist defending the civil rights of U.S. Muslims after the Sept. 11 attacks and came to wider prominence in recent years protesting against police surveillance of Muslims. She's become a regular at Black Lives Matter protests, too, and a frequent TV commentator on feminism.\n\nThe White House, during the Obama administration, honored Sarsour as a \"champion of change.\"\n\nHer profile got a lot higher, though, after last weekend's Women's March, where she was one of four national co-chairs of an event that brought out well over a million people in Washington, D.C., and around the country.\n\nSupporters responded to the online criticism with the Twitter hashtag #IMarchWithLinda.\n\nSome people who know her work in New York said the idea that she is a foot-soldier for the oppressive view of Islam promoted by Islamic State militants is laughable.\n\nSteven Choi, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, called the attacks \"part of a right-wing agenda to undermine a Muslim-American woman who has dedicated her life to public service.\"\n\nDetractors often focus in on Sarsour's frequent criticism of Israel's policies in the occupied territories. The child of Palestinian immigrants, she has acknowledged publicly that members of her extended family have been arrested on accusations of supporting Hamas.\n\nThe White House webpage that included information about the recognition she got during the Obama administration was taken down after Trump took office.\n\nSarsour said the anti-Trump march was high point in her career as an activist.\n\n\"I've proved I could do things people didn't think I could do,\" she said. But it has also made her feel \"much more unsafe.\"\n\nShe said she doesn't go out alone. Her three children aren't allowed to be home alone. She's taken additional steps lately, like using car services to get around, rather than public transportation.\n\n\"It puts myself in danger. It puts my family in danger,\" she said of the online vitriol. The accusations of supporting a terrorist group have been particularly upsetting for her children, she said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Deepti Hajela at www.twitter.com/dhajela.

The Jewish Agency, a nonprofit that works closely with the Israeli government to serve Jewish communities worldwide, has recognized the Abayudaya since 2009, spokesman Avi Mayer said.\n\n\"People come here for conversion, many of them,\" said Yonadav, a 40-year-old teacher who serves as cantor at the synagogue. \"I know 50 people right now who are ready to convert.\"\n\nYonadav recalled the day in 2013 when, crowded inside the old synagogue, the Abayudaya started to dream of a new sanctuary, complete with a Jewish ritual bath known as mikvah.\n\nThe group's leader, Gershom Sizomu, a U.S.-trained rabbi who in February won a seat in Uganda's parliament, started fundraising among friends abroad. The new synagogue is named for Sue and Ralph Stern, a Jewish couple in California who gave a sizeable chunk of the $300,000 spent on its construction, Sizomu said.\n\nSizomu, who believes he is the first Jew to win a parliamentary seat in Uganda, said he saw his victory as a sign that the Abayudaya are finally being accepted by an often-distrustful tribal community. In the 1970s, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin outlawed the group, which saw its numbers dwindle to a few hundred. In the 1980s, there were violent attempts to strip the Abayudaya of the land on which the new synagogue stands.\n\nToday the community of about 2,000 enjoys a more positive reputation. It runs a health center, two schools, a bakery project for women, a co-operative saving society and a guest house, as well as a tree-planting program.\n\nWith his electoral victory, Sizomu said, \"the Abayudaya felt very accepted. This was a sign that they are accepted by our Christian and Muslim neighbors.\"\n\nThe Abayudaya community was founded by a Ugandan military officer, Semei Kakungulu, a convert from Christianity in the early 20th century who had many followers. When he died in 1928, he left a large piece of his land to be used by the Abayudaya in perpetuity. Sizomu, as the current spiritual leader, has legal control over the group's assets.\n\nMany of the Abayudaya, including Sizomu and Yonadav, were born into families practicing Judaism and consider it their duty to raise their children within the Jewish tradition.\n\nUnlike fundamentalist Christian groups that seek out converts across Uganda, the Abayudaya practice Conservative Judaism with no proselytizing. Converts have to go through a rigorous process, and so far this year none has joined.\n\nJacob Mulabi, 18, a yarmulke-wearing student who defied his Christian family to convert, said he would have been out of school and hopeless if he had not decided \"to be like the Jewish people nearby, my best friends.\" His bar mitzvah was in 2014, and he is a scholarship student at an Abayudaya school where Hebrew is taught. The burglar bars on the windows are wrought to resemble the Star of David.\n\nOne recent morning, teacher Judith Horowitz of Philadelphia was among a dozen people who gathered inside the main sanctuary for prayers. Later, as the Abayudaya took off their prayer shawls and walked out, Horowitz said it was \"the most amazing experience praying with Jews that I've ever had in my lifetime.\"\n\nHorowitz, a Reform Jew, said she had read about the Abayudaya just as she and a friend from Boston were planning a safari to Uganda. \"I had to be here. I had to come.\"\n\nThe sight of the new synagogue, she said, left her \"amazed, thrilled\" and \"very happy to see that these people felt this faith in Judaism in the same way that I do.\"\n\nIn March, the Jewish Agency said the Abayudaya were a \"recognized\" Jewish community in a letter to the leader of Israel's Conservative movement.\n\nBut Israel's Interior Ministry, which oversees immigration policy and has the authority to formally recognize Jewish communities, has made no determination of the Abayudaya's religious status because it has never been asked. It described the matter as \"complex.\"\n\nAlthough any Jew is eligible for citizenship under Israeli immigration law, Sizomu said emigration is not in their plans.\n\n\"It is some kind of assurance,\" the rabbi said, talking about recognition by the Jewish Agency. \"Assurance that we are now part of the bigger Jewish world, and that is a privilege. Anywhere where there are Jews, I am welcome.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.9070294499397281, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 825, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.07139115672, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161221090000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.12121212121212, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/15/case-florist-who-denied-service-for-gay-wedding-is-heard.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [77]}}, "headline": "Case of florist who denied service for gay wedding is heard", "wordcount_as_scraped": 727, "date": "20161116000000", "story_content": "BELLEVUE, Wash. \u2013 \u00a0A florist who was sued for refusing to provide services for a same sex-wedding says she was exercising her First Amendment rights, but Washington state Supreme Court justices repeatedly questioned Tuesday whether ruling in her favor would mean other businesses could turn away customers based on racial or other grounds.\n\nThe court heard arguments in the closely watched case against Barronelle Stutzman, a 71-year-old florist in Richland, Washington, who was fined by a lower court for denying service to a gay couple in 2013.\n\nStutzman had previously sold the couple flowers and knew they were gay, but told them she couldn't provide flowers for their wedding because same-sex marriage was incompatible with her Christian beliefs.\n\nWashington Attorney General Bob Ferguson and the couple sued her, saying she broke state anti-discrimination and consumer protection laws, and the lower court agreed.\n\nIt's one of several lawsuits around the country \u2014 including some involving bakers and wedding photographers \u2014 about whether businesses can refuse to provide services involving causes they disagree with, or whether they must serve everyone equally.\n\n\"A Muslim graphics designer should not be compelled to create designs promoting a Jewish Friends of Israel group, a gay public relations manager shouldn't be forced to promote the Westboro Baptist Church, and a Christian floral designer shouldn't be forced to create custom wedding designs for a wedding that is not between one man and one woman,\" Stutzman's attorney, Kristin Waggoner, told the court.\n\nWaggoner immediately ran into questions. Justice Susan Owens brought up the state's first and only black justice, the recently deceased Charles Z. Smith, who had to stay in separate hotels from other attorneys when he traveled the country while working for the Justice Department in the 1960s.\n\n\"How is this different?\" Owens asked. \"Because I'm sure some of the owners of those hotels would profess they had strongly held religious beliefs that prohibited racial integration.\"\n\nFor one thing, Waggoner responded, renting out a hotel room isn't a form of artistic expression or speech deserving of protection. Stutzman's floral arrangements do constitute expression protected by the Constitution, the lawyer said, and the government can't compel that expression.\n\n\"If we even get to the point where we might acknowledge that making floral arrangements is freedom of expression, what's the limiting principle?\" asked Justice Mary Yu. \"Is it the landscape architect next? Is it the bartender?\"\n\nJustice Steven Gonzalez wanted to know why a business could refuse a gay couple but not an interracial couple. Waggoner suggested that her client's objections were based on a message \u2014 her opposition to same-sex marriage \u2014 rather than about targeting people for who they are, as the \"unique evils of racial segregation\" did.\n\nJustice Sheryl Gordon McCloud interrupted: \"So racial discrimination would be based on a bad religious belief, according to you, but this discrimination would not be based on a bad religious belief. Doesn't that task the courts with what's a good religious belief and what's a bad religious belief?\"\n\nWaggoner said it doesn't.\n\n\"The context of marriage is very different,\" she said, noting that millions of people believe marriage should be between one man and one woman, and those beliefs aren't necessarily rooted in religion.\n\nMichael Scott, a Seattle attorney who worked with the American Civil Liberties Union to represent Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed \u2014 the couple denied the flowers \u2014 said he didn't believe Stutzman's floral creations constituted speech. By providing flowers for a same-sex marriage, he argued, \"she's not endorsing same-sex marriage. She's selling what she sells.\"\n\nFerguson said the state's argument rests on longstanding principle, and uprooting it would severely weaken antidiscrimination law.\n\n\"'No shoes, no shirt, no service'; 'We do not use profanity in our messages' \u2014 a business can absolutely have policies in place about the services they provide, as long as they apply that policy equally and not discriminate or refuse service or say, 'We do not serve your kind,'\" Ferguson said.\n\nAfter the arguments, held in a packed theater at Bellevue College, a large crowd of Stutzman's supporters greeted her outside, chanting her name and waving signs with pictures of roses that said \"Justice For Barronelle.\" She told them she still feels fondly for Ingersoll, her old customer.\n\n\"To me, marriage is a very sacred event,\" she said. \"The government is asking me to choose between my affection for Rob and my faith.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Gene Johnson at https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.498753130435944, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 694, "FairnessVirtue": 10, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.7961011816799997, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161116000000, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 6, "pct_mft_words": 4.75504322766571, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/16/syrian-tv-aleppo-evacuation-suspended-rebels-opened-fire-on-convoy.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 683, "scraper_regex": 1121}}, "headline": "Aleppo evacuation halted after rebels fire on convoy, Syrian media report", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1121, "date": "20161216120000", "story_content": "The evacuation of eastern Aleppo stalled Friday after an eruption of gunfire, as the Syrian government and rebels threw accusations at each other, raising fears that a peaceful surrender of the opposition enclave could fall apart with thousands of people believed to be still inside.\n\nThe government suspended the evacuation, pulling out buses that had been ferrying out people Friday morning and the day before, after reports of shooting at a crossing point into the enclave. The foreign minister of Turkey, a backer of the rebels, said he was in talks with his counterpart in Iran, a top ally of the Syrian government, to try to get the process back on track.\n\nThe suspension demonstrated the fragility of the cease-fire deal under which civilians and fighters inside the few remaining blocks of the rebel enclave in Aleppo were to be taken to opposition-held territory nearby.\n\nIt appeared to be linked to a separate evacuation to remove thousands of people from two government-held Shiite villages besieged by the rebels. The Syrian government says those evacuations and that in eastern Aleppo must be carried out at the same time under the cease-fire deal, but the rebels say there is no connection.\n\nSyrian state media said rebels shelled a road that was supposed to be used by people evacuating from these two villages. The opposition's Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, however, said the Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters had cut the road to protest a lack of progress in the evacuations from Foua and Kfarya.\n\nBuses that arrived at a collection point in Hama countryside to pick up people evacuating from the villages waited for hours without any evacuations happening.\n\nLater Friday, two rebel spokesmen privy to the talks said the fighters besieging the two Shiite villages, including al-Qaida linked militant group Fatah al-Sham Front, have agreed to evacuate several hundred wounded from the Shiite villages. If it happens, this may lead to the resumption of evacuation from Aleppo.\n\nThere were differing reports on how many people had been evacuated from the enclave and how many remained inside, who would be in danger of being caught in the crossfire if the cease-fire falls apart. Reports by opposition activists and officials in eastern Aleppo ranged from 15,000 to 40,000 civilians still inside the tiny enclave, along with some 6,000 fighters\n\nThe evacuations seal the end of the Syrian rebels' most important stronghold -- the eastern part of the city of Aleppo -- and mark a watershed moment in the country's civil war, now in its sixth year.\n\nIn announcing the suspensions, Syrian state TV also claimed that the rebels had tried to take captives with them, ones they had seized and were holding in the rebel enclave from bitter battles to defend their territory from a ferocious, weeks-long onslaught by Syrian President Bashar Assad's troops.\n\nThe Lebanon-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV aired images Friday of public green buses reportedly returning evacuees to east Aleppo after the road was closed.\n\nBut despite the closure, scores of people and patients were apparently evacuated before the evacuation was suspended, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAs of 7 a.m. on Friday, a total of 194 patients had been evacuated and taken to hospitals in rebel-controlled areas of Aleppo province, nearby Idlib province or across the border into Turkey, said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic. Among them, 65 were in critical condition, he said.\n\nElizabeth Hoff, the WHO's Syria representative, said by phone from western Aleppo that there are still \"high numbers of women and infants, children under five, that need to get out.\"\n\nBefore the operation was suspended, dozens of green public buses and ambulances were parked in the southern Aleppo neighborhood of Ramouseh to evacuate more people from eastern Aleppo. Syrian state TV showed a truck with dozens of men, driving through the corridor leading to the rebel-held parts of the surrounding provinces.\n\nSyrian state TV said that since the early hours of the day, four convoys have left Aleppo. It said some of the evacuees were using their own vehicles to leave.\n\nEarlier on Friday, as the evacuations were resuming for a second day, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a major new Syria peace initiative, saying he and his Turkish counterpart are working to set up Kazakhstan-based peace talks between Damascus and the opposition.\n\nSpeaking on a visit to Japan, Putin said that the negotiations would take place in Astana, Kazakhstan's capital, and that he and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are also working for an overall truce in Syria. Putin said Ankara had helped broker the rebel exit from Aleppo currently underway.\n\nHowever, the Western-backed Syrian opposition is unlikely to accept the location Putin had proposed for the negotiations.\n\nThere have been contradicting reports of how many people were evacuated from Aleppo on Thursday. Syrian state TV said that more than 9,000 people were evacuated on Thursday alone. Syrian state TV said the evacuees included 3,475 men, 3,137 women, 2,359 children and 108 wounded people.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said about 4,000 civilians were taken out on Thursday. The Syrian state news agency said 2,300 opposition fighters and their families left Aleppo the previous night.\n\nRussia, a key Assad ally, says that more than 6,462 people, including more than 3,000 rebels and 301 wounded, have been taken out.\n\nFor the opposition, the evacuation was a humiliating defeat. A smiling Assad called it a historic event comparable to the birth of Christ and the revelation of the Quran.\n\nAl-Mayadeen TV interviewed an official with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent in the central province of Hama who said that buses and ambulances were waiting to evacuate thousands of people from Foua and Kfarya -- a last-minute condition that became part of the cease-fire deal for Aleppo.\n\nThe SARC official said they will likely begin the evacuation of 15,000 people from the Shiite northwestern villages, adding that the priority will be for the wounded, elderly people, women, children and those with chronic illnesses.\n\nSyrian state TV said 110 buses and 19 medical teams were being prepared to take those being evacuated from the two Shiite villages. Iran had demanded to tie the evacuations from Foua and Kefraya with Aleppo's.\n\nSeparately, Hezbollah's media arm, Al-Manar TV, said Syrian government supporters closed the road used by evacuees form Aleppo, demanding the wounded from the two villages be allowed to leave.\n\nTurkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said Prime Minister Binali Yildirim had placed a call to Iranian Presidential Deputy Ishak Cihangiri, addressing regional bilateral issues in the context of recent developments in Aleppo.\n\nYildirim told Cihangiri he was confident Iran would take the necessary initiatives in order for the evacuation process to proceed smoothly, and that he was ready to cooperate with Tehran on the issue.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 10, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.4468083381652805, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 683, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.42330370614, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.36749633967789, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/30/david-asman-your-social-security-checks-arent-safe-from-prying-hands-big-government.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3934]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 599, "scraper_regex": 655}}, "headline": "David Asman: Your Social Security checks aren't safe from the prying hands of big government", "wordcount_as_scraped": 655, "date": "20170130230000", "story_content": "During this month's confirmation hearings for HHS nominee Tom Price, Democrats got on their high horses about how he'd better not ever touch Social Security and Medicare, which is our sacred right. Dr. Price, of course, agreed. But he should have pointed out that for Democrats to warn others not to touch Social Security is the height of hypocrisy. RIGHT NOW the government is grabbing money from seniors' Social Security accounts to pay for politicians' spending sprees.\n\nFor me, this is personal. Two weeks ago my parents' bookkeeper called to tell me that my folks were getting about $500 less every month in their Social Security checks. I was shocked. They're not poor, but that's a lot of money. And most importantly it's THEIR own very hard-earned money. Social Security is not supposed to be a welfare re-distribution plan. This is money taken every week from your paycheck that the government guarantees is placed safely in a lockbox until you retire. But that lockbox has been cracked open, and the government is now stealing my parents' money\u2026and I assume the money of a lot of other retirees, as well. This has to stop.\n\nWhat and who is responsible for this thievery? Last April President Obama signed into law (with bipartisan support!) something called the \"Doc Fix.\" Politicians sold the plan as a smart way to help pay for low income Medicare recipients and children who did not have access to health care. Retired folks who report a lot of income got docked pay from their Social Security checks to supposedly pay more for \"widows and orphans.\"\n\nOf course, if you believe that all the money from the \"Doc Fix\" really goes directly to poor Medicare patients and children, you probably still believe in the tooth fairy. But the transparency of that promise pales in comparison to the infamy of paying for it by dipping into the Social Security accounts of the elderly. If the poor and children need more government support, than lobby to tax people more for that particular purpose.\n\nAlso, as it happens, my parents aren't the rich people the \"Doc Fix\" was designed to hit. They didn't really make a lot of money last year. The reason why they were thrust into a \"wealthier\" category that allowed the government to take money from their Social Security accounts is that they had a lot of expenses in 2015 that came from getting older. To pay for extra medical procedures and help while they were recuperating, they had to sell off a lot of their stock, which added to their adjusted gross income. They might have appeared wealthier on paper, but in reality the money they \"made\" was used for elderly care expenses. They actually live a very simple life and haven't bought anything extravagant since my dad purchased a Mercedes Benz in 1999. And yet, they're considered rich enough and free spending enough to afford a major cut in Social Security. And I bet they're not alone.\n\nTo pay for a dubious government program by taking money out of Social Security checks is both callous and dishonest.\n\nCallous, because those who are being double-taxed are Depression-era folks who worked hard all their lives, fought bravely in wars for this country and deserve far more respect and thanks than they usually receive.\n\nDishonest, because your Social Security account is a promissory note from the government that they are supposed to honor for life.\n\nTo break that promise is to tear at the fiber of a social contract between individuals and the government that is already dangerously thin.\n\n\n\nDavid Asman joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in 1997 and currently serves as host of \"Forbes on FOX,\" a weekend half-hour program that offers an informative look at the business week (Saturday from 11:00-11:30 AM/ET).

Financial analysts have predicted a Trump win would threaten billions of dollars in cross-border trade, and government officials say they have drawn up a contingency plan for such a scenario, though without releasing details.\n\n\"It's DEFCON 2,\" Mexican analyst Alejandro Hope said. \"Probably something as close to a national emergency as Mexico has faced in many decades.\"\n\nThe impact of his unexpected electoral triumph is also being felt strongly in the volatile Middle East, where multiple crises are unfolding.\n\nIran's foreign minister said the United States must respect the commitments it made as part of last year's historic nuclear deal. Trump had criticized the accord during the campaign and said he would try to renegotiate it.\n\nMohammad Javad Zarif spoke Wednesday during a visit to Romania after Trump's win was clear. The foreign minister said that it's important \"that whoever is elected president of America should fully understand current realities of the world and conform their policies with those realities.\"\n\nHe says the incoming U.S. president \"should respect the commitments that the American government has accepted, not as a bilateral deal, but as a multilateral one.\"\n\nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump and called him a \"true friend of the State of Israel.\"\n\nNetanyahu said that he believes the two leaders \"will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between our two countries and bring it to ever greater heights.\"\n\nEarlier, a key ally in Netanyahu's center-right coalition, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, said Trump's victory means that \"the era of a Palestinian state is over.\"\n\nThe Palestinians want a state in lands Israel captured in 1967. Netanyahu has said he is willing to negotiate a border deal, but has retracted offers made by his predecessors while pressing ahead with Jewish settlement expansion on war-won land.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that he hopes \"peace will be achieved\" during Trump's term.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi congratulated Trump, saying he's looking forward to continued support in his country's fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nIn a statement on his website, al-Abadi said he hopes the \"world and the United States will continue to support Iraq in fighting terrorism.\" He says terrorism doesn't threaten Iraq alone, but the whole world.\n\nIn Europe, NATO allies will now wait to see if Trump follows through on suggestions that the U.S. will look at whether they have paid their proper share in considering whether to come to their defense.\n\nTrump's rhetoric has challenged the strategic underpinning of the NATO alliance, rattling its leaders at a time when Russia has been increasingly aggressive.\n\nDaniela Schwarzer, an expert on trans-Atlantic relations at the German Council on Foreign Relations, said Germany and Europe can't rely on its partnership with the U.S. because of Trump's stated policies.\n\n\"As a candidate, Trump called into question NATO and trade agreements, and reached out to Moscow,\" she said. \"His campaign of discrimination, lies and aggression harmed the principles of liberal democracy. Even if President Trump doesn't implement everything, Germany and Europe can't rely on the trans-Atlantic partnership as usual and have to stand up for Western values themselves.\"\n\nGerman Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen called the vote \"a big shock\" and \"a vote against Washington, against the establishment.\"\n\nTrump's victory pleased leaders of the nationalist Alternative for Germany party who said it will have a ripple effect and help change the balance of political power in Germany and the rest of Europe. The party has campaigned strongly against Chancellor Angela Merkel's policy of letting hundreds of thousands of migrants into the country.\n\n\"It was high time that people disenfranchised by the political establishment get their voice back in the United States of America too,\" party co-leader Frauke Petry said.\n\nThe French populist, anti-immigrant politician Marine Le Pen was also pleased. She congratulated Trump even before the final results were known, tweeting her support to the \"American people, free!\"\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said European politicians should heed the message from Trump votes.\n\n\"There is a part of our electorate that feels ... abandoned,\" including people who feel \"left behind by globalization,\" he said.\n\nTrump's victory is being viewed with shock and revulsion in Ireland, a country close to the Clintons and fearful of Trump's campaign pledge to confront U.S. companies using Ireland as a tax shelter.\n\nThe Irish Times branded the New York businessman a \"misogynistic racist liar.\"\n\nIrish Times columnist Fintan O'Toole wrote Wednesday: \"The republic of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt is now the United Hates of America.\"\n\n\"President Trump is the creation of the same demographic that gave Europe its far-right authoritarian movements with such disastrous consequences for the world,\" he wrote.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May issued a statement saying she looks forward to working with Trump. Many other European leaders did the same.\n\nPutin sent Trump a telegram Wednesday morning congratulating him on his victory.\n\nHe said in a televised statement that Russia is ready to \"do everything\" to restore Russian-U.S. relations, which have been badly strained in recent years.\n\nMoscow has been unusually prominent in the race. Clinton's campaign and the Obama administration blamed Russian hackers for leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign staff. Trump, in turn, has made complimentary remarks about Putin. The ties some of his advisers and former campaign officials have to Russia have raised suspicions.\n\nIn Asia, security issues and trade will top the agenda for the new administration, from North Korea and the South China Sea to the contentious and yet-unratified Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.\n\nChinese state media and government-backed commentators had signaled Beijing's preference for a Trump win. Like Russia, China is seen as favoring Trump because he appears less willing to confront China's newly robust foreign policy, particularly in the South China Sea.\n\nClinton, by contrast, is disliked in Beijing for having steered the U.S. \"pivot\" to Asia aimed at strengthening U.S. engagement with the region, particularly in the military sphere.\n\nScholar Mei Xinyu wrote in the Communist Party newspaper Global Times that China would find it easier to cope with a Trump presidency.\n\n\"Trump has always insisted on abandoning ideological division and minimizing the risks that unnecessary conflicts with other countries may bring to the U.S.,\" Mei wrote.\n\nNews of Trump's widening lead hit hard in Cuba, which has spent the last two years negotiating normalization with the United States after more than 50 years of Cold War hostility, setting off a tourism boom. Trump has promised to roll back Obama's opening with Cuba unless President Raul Castro agrees to more political freedoms.\n\n\"If he reverses it, it hurts us,\" taxi driver Oriel Iglesias Garcia said. \"You know tourism will go down.\"\n\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.15384614467621, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1200, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.84981042485, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 11, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 50, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161109130000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.54545454545, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 4.16666666666667, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/15/new-test-could-improve-diagnosis-rare-fatal-brain-disorder.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [943, 3996]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 901, "scraper_regex": 953}}, "headline": "New test could improve diagnosis of rare, fatal brain disorder ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 953, "date": "20161215180000", "story_content": "A rare and fatal brain disorder called sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be challenging to identify, with patients needing to undergo a number of tests before a diagnosis can be made. But a new test could improve the accuracy of the diagnosis, according to a new study from Italy.\n\nIn the study involving dozens of patients, the test, known as RT-QuIC testing, was 100 percent accurate in identifying patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) , as well as 100 percent accurate at excluding patients who didn't have the disease, when the researchers followed a two-step process of testing.\n\n\"Our results suggest that the application of RT-QuIC testing will improve the accuracy and speed of sporadic CJD diagnosis,\" compared with current methods of testing, the researchers, from the University of Verona, wrote in the Dec. 12 issue of the journal JAMA Neurology.\u00a0\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects about 1 in 1 million people each year worldwide, according to the National Institutes of Health. In the early stages of the disease, people can have memory and vision problems, and a lack of coordination, followed by involuntary movements, blindness and coma. People typically die within a year of showing symptoms, the NIH says.\n\nThe disease is caused by proteins in the brain called prions . These proteins fold abnormally, and lead to lesions in the brain.\n\nThere are three forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: one that is inherited, one that can be caught from exposure to infected tissue from the brain or nervous system (sometimes referred to as \" mad cow disease \"), and one type that is \"sporadic\" and does not appear to have a genetic or environmental cause.\n\nThe sporadic type is the most common, responsible for 85 percent of cases, according to the NIH.\n\nUsually, people who have sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are diagnosed by a number of physical exams and laboratory tests. These tests can include a test of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) that looks for certain proteins called 14-3-3 and tau proteins, which are associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\n\nBut RT-QuIC, which stands for \"real-time quaking-induced conversion,\" lets researchers test directly for the abnormal prions that cause the disease.\n\nThe test requires a sample of CSF or a sample of cells collected from inside a patient's nose using a swab, or both.\n\nThen, the samples are tested for prions . Because patients may have only a small amount of abnormal prions in their brains, the RT-QuIC method amplifies prions so they can be detected. (It accelerates the process by which the prions replicate, until they are present in quantities large enough to be detected.)\n\nIn the study, the researchers used the test on 61 patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and 71 patients who didn't have the disease. (Because the only way to confirm Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is to test brain tissue after death, patients were followed until death, or until they received an alternative diagnosis.)\n\nAll 61 patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease tested positive for the condition based on the samples of CSF or nasal cells, or both.\n\nThe test was not perfectly accurate when only samples of CSF were used, or only nasal cells. But the researchers found that when they used a two-step process (using CSF testing first, followed by nasal cell testing in some cases), the test was 100 percent accurate. They were able to correctly diagnose all of the patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and correctly exclude all of the patients who had a different condition.\n\nThat's an improvement over current diagnostic methods \u2014 a 2009 study found that the current methods correctly diagnose about 83 percent of people who actually have sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and correctly exclude 71 percent of people who don't have the disease.\u00a0\n\nThere is no treatment for CJD. But getting a fast test result could benefit patients who don't have the disease \u2014 in the study, some of the patients who were thought to possibly have CJD tested negative, and then were treated successfully for the conditions they actually had, the researchers said.\n\nThe RT-QuIC testing method used in the new study \"should soon become the standard laboratory examination for the diagnosis of sporadic CJD, adding to or replacing current tests for 14-3-3 and tau proteins in CSF,\" Dr. Paul Brown, a former senior investigator at the National Institutes of Health who is now retired, wrote in an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nInterestingly, the RT-QuIC test did not perform as well on patients who had an inherited form of CJD ; of the eight patients in the study with genetic forms of the disease, only half had a positive test result.\n\nThe reason for this finding is not clear, and it's too soon to draw conclusions, given the small number of patients in the study with genetic forms of the disease, Brown said. However, it could be that the sporadic form and genetic forms are truly different in terms of the timing and distribution of the abnormal proteins in the CSF and nasal cells, Brown said.\n\nThe researchers noted that the genetic forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease generally would be identified using results of genetic testing for mutations in the prion protein.\n\nFinally, because the study included only patients who already had symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, it's not clear whether the test could identify patients before they start to show symptoms, the researchers said.\n\nRT-QuIC testing is already available in most Western countries (including some laboratories in the United States), as well as in Japan and Australia, the researchers said. It typically costs about $100 to $200 per test, and the results are available in one day for nasal cell tests and three days for CSF tests, they said.\n\nOriginal article on Live Science .\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.226824283599849, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 901, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.793287888099999, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 24, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215180000, "FairnessVice": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.44062153163152, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/11/small-tornado-touches-down-as-storm-wallops-california.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2557]}}, "headline": "Tornado hits California as flood dangers surge", "wordcount_as_scraped": 732, "date": "20170111170000", "story_content": "A small tornado tore tree limbs and ripped awnings as a powerful band of thunderstorms moved through Northern California during the latest deluge to swell rivers and prompt evacuations over flood fears.\n\nCAUGHT ON VIDEO: MOM, 3 KIDS RESCUED AFTER MINIVAN PLUNGES DOWN STEEP EMBANKMENT\n\nThe tornado was on the ground for about 3/8 of a mile just south of Sacramento late Tuesday, National Weather Service meteorologist David Rowe said.\n\nNo injuries were reported from the twister, which was about 100 yards wide and registered on the low end of the tornado scale.\n\nThe twister got the attention of forecasters at the weather service's Sacramento office.\n\nHISTORIC HOLLOWED-OUT SEQUOIA TREE IN CALIFORNIA TOPPLES DURING STORM\n\n\"It came as a little bit of a surprise considered that we're so focused on all the heavy snow and rain,\" Rowe said, adding that the Sacramento area received about 2 inches of rain Tuesday.\n\nMeteorologists in the Northwest received their own storm surprise.

The Corte Madera Creek was flowing 1 foot over flood stage, the Marin County Sheriff's Office said.\n\nIn Southern California the second fast-moving storm this week dumped steady rain. Officials warned residents along Los Angeles-area hillsides scarred by wildfires of the possibility of mudslides, but only minor debris flows were reported.\n\nThe storms were the latest of back-to-back systems that have brought the heaviest rain in a decade to parts of Northern California and Nevada.\n\nA series of storms already has added 33 billion gallons of water to Lake Tahoe since Jan. 1.\n\nThe storms are part of an \"atmospheric river\" weather phenomenon that draws precipitation from the Pacific Ocean as far west as Hawaii.\n\nIn Colorado, several passes are closed so crews can trigger slides Wednesday to make them safe as more snow falls in the mountains.

It killed 36 people.

The landlord's daughter, Eva Ng, told The Los Angeles Times that the Ng family didn't know people were living in the warehouse in violation of city zoning laws.\n\nThe blaze was the nation's most lethal structure fire since 100 people perished in a Rhode Island bar in 2003.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kristen Bender and Ellen Knickmeyer in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.6979866027832005, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 545, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.1360342382999997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.56880733944954, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/12/afro-palestinians-forge-unique-identity-in-israel.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [4763], "\u00a0": [65]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 993, "scraper_regex": 1043}}, "headline": "'Afro-Palestinians' forge a unique identity in Israel", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1043, "date": "20170112070000", "story_content": "JERUSALEM \u2013 \u00a0In the shadow of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's Old City lies the \"African Quarter\" \u2014 home to a little-known community of nearly 50 Arab families of African descent.\n\nDescended from Muslim pilgrims from a variety of African countries, they now consider themselves proud Palestinians, despite widespread poverty and occasional discrimination from both Palestinians and Israelis. Several have even participated in violent attacks against Israel.\n\n\"We regard ourselves to be Afro-Palestinian,\" said community leader Ali Jiddah.\n\nJiddah, a former member of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, spent 17 years in Israeli prison for taking part in a 1968 bombing that wounded nine Israelis before he was freed in a prisoner swap. Jiddah, who long ago renounced violence, is now a well-known tour guide in the Old City, offering what he calls an \"alternative\" perspective on the conflict with Israel.\n\nAfro-Palestinians reside in various Palestinian cities, with large communities in Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho.\n\nSome are the descendants of slaves or soldiers brought in during Ottoman times. The forefathers of Jerusalem's African Quarter are mostly Muslim pilgrims from Chad, Sudan, Nigeria and Senegal who settled here or got stuck during periods of war.\n\n\"My father came from Chad, from the Salamat tribe,\" said Mousa Qous, 55, director of the African Community Society, a grassroots center that serves black Palestinians in Jerusalem.\n\nStanding under posters of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Nelson Mandela, he said his father came to Jerusalem on a religious pilgrimage in 1959 and \"then decided to stay to fight in the 1967 war.\"\n\nOthers came with The Arab Salvation Army, an army of volunteers that fought on the Arab side in the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation.\n\n\"We are originally Nubians from Aswan,\" in southern Egypt, said 30 year-old Hanan Bersi.\n\nSome still have their ancestors' identification documents, like Ibrahim Firawi, whose grandfather came from Sudan's western region of Darfur.\n\n\"We have documents and letters, and even tried to contact the Sudanese Embassy in Jordan to help connect us with family in Sudan,\" he said. Showing off his father's old passport, he said he has not been able to track down any of his relatives.\n\nHistoric Palestine was a crossroads for different cultures, and some Palestinians trace back their roots to a range of non-Arab groups, from Kurds to Indians and Afghans. Afro-Palestinians were denied Jordanian citizenship after the 1967 war, as they were not seen as Palestinians. Israel has treated members of the group like other Palestinians with varying degrees of rights depending on whether they live in east Jerusalem, the West Bank or Gaza.\n\nBut even after decades in the region, fitting in has not always been easy. As newcomers, many faced discrimination because of their skin color.\n\n\"Our parents were foreigners. They were more sensitive as foreigners, and people would tell them that they were foreigners, that their color was such and such,\" said Hawa Balalawi, a shop owner whose father was from Chad.\n\nMost of Jerusalem's Afro-Palestinian residents live in old buildings that were originally built in the 10th century for the city's poor. Made later into prisons by the Ottomans, the buildings were handed over to the Old City's Islamic trusteeship during the British Mandate, which rented them to members of the African community because many served as guards or servants at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nDespite these deep roots to the area, some Palestinians still refer to them with a local derogatory term, \"abeed,\" Arabic for \"slaves,\" and to their neighborhood as \"habs al-abeed\" or the \"slaves' prison.\"\n\n\"We fought the usage of this term and mentality for many years,\" Quos said. \"Less people use it now.\" But he said racism can still surface, in marriage proposals, for example.\n\n\"Sometimes when a black Palestinian wants to marry a white Palestinian woman, some members of her family might object,\" he said. \"It's not a phenomenon, and recently, there have been more inter-marriages.\"\n\nJiddah, the tour guide, blamed ignorance for any type of racism among Palestinians, and points out that he has experienced similar racism from Israelis.\n\n\"We Afro-Palestinians are dually oppressed, as Palestinians and because of our color the Israelis call us \"kushis\" \u2014 a derogatory word for blacks.\n\nStill, he said the involvement of Afro-Palestinians in the struggle for independence has elevated their status in the eyes of their fellow countrymen.\n\n\"The respect we get from Palestinians is because of our role in the national struggle,\" said Jiddah, who sits daily at a caf\u00e9 near the Old City's Damascus Gate sipping Turkish coffee, chain smoking and waving hello to constant passers-by.\n\n\"More Catholic than the Pope? We are more Palestinian than Palestinians,\" he said.\n\nThe first female Palestinian political prisoner was Fatima Bernawi in 1968, of Nigerian ancestry. She was imprisoned for a failed bombing attempt on a cinema in 1967, before being sent into exile. After an interim peace accord in 1993, Bernawi returned to serve as a senior Palestinian police official, and now lives in Jordan.\n\nQous, the director of the Jerusalem center, spent five years in prison for participating in the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in the early 1990s. Like Jiddah, he is a former member of the PFLP who has also put his militant days behind him.\n\nIsrael has its own groups of Jews of African ancestry. Jewish communities from Arab countries in north Africa like Tunisia, Libya and Morocco immigrated to the newly established Jewish state in the 1950s, and over the past 30 to 40 years, black Jews from Ethiopia have immigrated to Israel. While Ethiopians have made some inroads, the community still suffers from poverty and discrimination.\n\nEconomically, Afro-Palestinians are among the most disenfranchised in the city.\n\n\"Many leave school early to support their families and the houses that we live in are very small houses,\" Qous explained.\n\nA third generation of Afro-Palestinians is now growing up within the walls of the African Quarter, more integrated and confident about their place.\n\nAhmad Jibril, 17, who fashions a haircut reminiscent of a young Bobby Brown and recently was put under house arrest for taking part in protests, says he has no ambiguity about his national identity.\n\n\"I am Palestinian, it shouldn't matter if I'm white or black,\" he said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.5422344207763703, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 993, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 10, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.38439741635, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 45, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170112070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.53172205438066, "mft_mean": 4.090909090909999}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/27/new-party-no-dems-prepare-for-battle-with-trump-on-cabinet-picks-agenda.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1785, 2556]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 833, "scraper_regex": 878}}, "headline": "New Party of No?

But the resistance extends well beyond fortifying their ObamaCare defenses.\n\nBloomberg reports that Democrats are preparing for a separate fight with Republicans over plans to overhaul the tax code.\n\n\"There's going to be opposition if these tax cuts are directed to the people at the top again,\" Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the next top Democrat on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, told Bloomberg. \"We're going to be pretty united.\"\n\nWhile Democrats have not put forward their own plan, House Republicans and Trump both have outlined overhauls. Both would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, including reducing the top rate for individuals from 39.6 percent to 33 percent. The gist of the plans is to lower tax rates for most people, and make up lost revenue by scaling back exemptions, deductions and credits.\u00a0\n\nLOBBYING EFFORT IN FULL SWING TO CONFIRM SESSIONS\n\nThe House plan, however, retains some of the most popular tax breaks, including those for paying a mortgage, going to college, making charitable contributions and having children.\n\nAs Democrats prepare to fight proposed tax breaks for top earners, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have signaled they may play hardball. Both GOP leaders have said they plan to use a legislative maneuver that would prevent Senate Democrats from using the filibuster to block a tax bill.\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, are signaling a potentially rocky road ahead for some of Trump's Cabinet picks, last week demanding extensive financial information on some of his wealthy candidates. \u00a0\n\nFrustrated by the slow response of billionaires and multimillionaires to their request, 16 Democrats delivered an ultimatum Thursday, saying no committee should vote on a nominee until the individual has cleared an FBI background check, provided a financial report and an ethics agreement with the Office of Government Ethics, and responded to \"reasonable requests for additional information\" such as tax returns.\n\n\"The United States Senate has a rich, bipartisan tradition of vetting nominees to the president's Cabinet,\" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Democratic leader.\n\nRepublicans controlling the Senate want to make quick work of Cabinet confirmations once Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\nDemocrats have limited options to block nominees outright because they changed filibuster rules when they controlled the Senate in 2013, and Cabinet nominees can win approval on a simple majority vote. Republicans will hold a 52-48 advantage next year. However, Democrats could drag out the process in committee or force longer Senate debates than usual.\n\nTrump's choice of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state has been a focal point of the complaints. In a letter to colleagues, Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the Foreign Relations Committee's top Democrat, said he asked the Trump transition team for three years' worth of tax returns because Tillerson was \"actively engaged with many foreign governments\" at ExxonMobil. Cardin said Tillerson \"promised to provide\" the tax information in response to a question on a standard questionnaire that all nominees submit prior to appearing before the committee.\n\nTennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the committee chairman, quickly responded with a statement saying the GOP-controlled panel never officially asked for the tax returns and insisted that Tillerson was ahead of schedule in providing information to the committee. He said it is not the practice of his committee to request tax information, and the committee's own financial disclosure forms \"are very expansive.\"\n\nIn addition to Tillerson, Trump has tapped Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive, for treasury secretary, and Betsy DeVos, daughter of the Amway co-founder, for education secretary.\n\nTrump's conservative allies outside Capitol Hill are preparing for confirmation turbulence. The Judicial Crisis Network recently launched a website touting the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., for attorney general and defending his record in office.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, told Fox News last week that he anticipates congressional Democrats will fall into a few groups as Trump joins with majority Republicans to pursue his agenda.\n\n\"You're going to have the hard left -- the Elizabeth Warrens who aren't going to support anybody. They'll be hostile and bitter and nasty. You're going to have the partisan group -- Pelosi is a good example. They are going to be tough-minded,\" he said. \"But there are going to be a lot of Democrats that are going to say 'I don't want to deal with eight years of yelling no.'\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.83224391937256, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 833, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.30701409826, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 1, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.12124849939976, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2016/12/02/15-design-features-dream-kitchen/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1354, "scraper_regex": 1477}}, "headline": "15 Design Features of a Dream Kitchen", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1477, "date": "20161202180000", "story_content": "All designers and homeowners have their own ideas about what makes a great kitchen, but throughout my years in the design world, I've come to rely on several go-to strategies for creating a successful, functional, beautiful space. The addition of any one of these items would greatly increase the appeal of a space. Combine them all, and you'd have one spectacular dream kitchen.\n\n1. Adequate lighting. Incorporating various types of lighting in any room is fundamental, but it's especially beneficial in the kitchen. An abundance of natural light is fantastic, but kitchens also need practical sources of artificial light: ambient lighting to create an overall glow, task lighting to illuminate workspaces and accent lighting to highlight features in the space.\n\nBrightening on a budget: Not ready for a lighting overhaul? Start by replacing your old bulbs with LEDs \u2014 they last longer, are more energy efficient and are available in cool, warm and neutral color temperatures. Undermounted LED rope lighting or puck lights are also affordable options for illuminating areas where cabinets cast shadows.\n\n2. Abundant seating. One of the biggest requests I hear as an interior designer is a need for more guest seating. People tend to congregate in kitchens, so make sure there is ample room for friends to gather in areas that won't interfere with the functionality of your prep space.\n\nRound tables are a great way to provide easier traffic flow and can usually seat four to six people. Drop-leaf or extendable tables give you flexibility. They can be pushed against the wall out of the way when not in use or adjusted to create additional seating for entertaining guests. This is a good solution for a house that lacks a formal dining room.\n\n3. Surface area. A large island with lots of counter space and seating offers room for collaboration. Routine tasks such as paying bills, sorting through mail, doing homework or whipping up dinner can be executed without first having to move things around to make space. Having this clear surface also has a psychological effect that makes the home seem tidy even if other areas of the home are haphazard or covered with piles of items.\n\nNo room for an island? Here are a few space-saving tips:\n\n4. Movable workstation. An island on wheels, or even a bar cart, is great for cooking and entertaining. It provides more storage and a versatile surface area for prepping and serving.\n\nWhat to look for: Stainless steel is great because it's durable and easy to clean, or opt for the more affordable option, butcher block, for a different look and feel. When it comes to size, make sure you have about 36 inches between the edge of the island and surrounding countertops so as not to impede traffic flow. Depending on your preference, you can opt for counter height or bar height. Take note of what's most comfortable before you head out shopping.\n\n5. Organized drawers. Divide and conquer! Save your time and sanity by keeping things neat and easy to find. Inserts and dividers add structure to drawers where loose items tend to pile up. Having designated spaces for all odds and ends will help you avoid overflow.\n\nWhen shopping for organizers, remember to first measure your drawers. Avoid cheap plastic options that warp over time, and instead search for something just as durable as the cabinetry.\n\nUtensil storage is key. It's better (and cleaner) to neatly tuck away tools than to have a bouquet of spatulas sitting out on the counter.\n\nShallow spice storage allows you to quickly see what you have rather than fumbling through a crowded cluster of jars. Bonus points if you move your spices from their original packaging into matching containers.\n\nStack baking sheets and cutting boards vertically in deep drawers (if you have them) or narrow cabinets for easier access. Dividers will keep them upright. Don't forget to define separate cutting boards for produce, meats and breads.\n\nOrganization for food storage containers always seems to be an afterthought (and one of the messiest parts of most kitchens). How many times have you reached for a piece of Tupperware only to find its corresponding lid has vanished? Cabinets eat loose lids, so keep them together. We prefer glass storage for food as it is microwaveable and stays in good shape longer.\n\n6. Pot and pan (and lid) organization. If you are able to grab a pot or pan and its lid without shuffling the rest of your cookware around, you're golden. Hanging them from hooks is a great way to achieve this feat and make efficient use of vertical space.\n\n7. Pullout corner storage. Clever cabinet organizers offer easier accessibility and help maximize the otherwise dead space where your Tupperware lids are probably hiding.\n\nYou can find a multitude of products like this online or through your local cabinetry company, and most corner features can be retrofitted to your existing cabinetry.\n\n8. Dedicated appliance storage. Hidden storage for small appliances frees up counter space for more valuable uses.\n\nWhen designing your kitchen or remodeling cabinets, consider adding an appliance garage to keep your tools tucked away. Homeowners also can convert an existing cabinet by installing pullout shelves that offer quick and easy access to appliances when you need them. Whatever you do, assign a designated space for each gadget so they don't end up awkwardly stacked on top of the fridge or out on the counter.\n\n9. Sturdy hardware. Protect your cabinets with hardware. Over time, oil from hands can wear down the finish and dirty up or scratch the paint. Avoid unnecessary wear and tear with sleek pulls or knobs that will extend the life of your cabinetry. Look for a solid metal or something sturdy with substantial weight. It will benefit you \u2014 and your cabinets \u2014 in the long run.\n\n10. Citrus. When life gives you lemons, put 'em to work. Whether you're adding a little zest to your meal, spritzing up a refreshing drink, loading up on vitamin C or just cleaning up the kitchen, citrus is a useful item to have on hand (plus, it displays well as a nice splash of color).\n\nLemons and limes are great for organic garbage disposal cleanup. Running the rinds through with water helps to clean the blades, and the oils freshen up the scent. You can also concoct your own organic cleaning solution with lemon, baking soda and vinegar \u2014 just steer clear of marble countertops. The acid can cause staining and etching.\n\n11. Hand towels. Use decorative linen towels to reduce waste by using fewer paper towels. Not only are cloth towels more eco-friendly, they save you money and add a little charm to the kitchen.\n\nIn addition to your pretty tea towels and cloth napkins, you'll want to keep a stack of cleaning towels or microfiber cloths on hand so they're ready to grab when you need them. It will be less painful to forgo the convenience of paper towels if you're well-stocked for the next mess.\n\n12. A well-defined catch-all space. Daily life makes it impossible to have an organized home 24/7. Papers, keys, footwear, water bottles, bags and other various items tend to pile up quickly in certain areas. Avoid surface clutter by giving each of your things a designated home. Keys, mail, phone chargers and pens should all have a dedicated landing spot, whether it's a full-fledged, built-in command center, the back of a cabinet or organized space inside a closet.\n\n13. Enclosed trash and recycling. Trash bins take up floor space, can smell bad and are a source of mayhem for family pets. Hidden storage is optimal, but if you don't have that option, at least make sure your containers have lids. Keeping bins and bags together makes it easy to separate waste and recyclables.\n\nCabinets can be retrofitted to house custom pullout containers, but if you're looking for an easy solution, check out popular retailers like The Container Store or Ikea for a variety of bins that will work to fit your existing space.\n\n14. Coffee station. Life is just a little bit easier when you have everything you need in one spot. If you can find a way to build it in or enclose it, even better. While a full-on coffee bar isn't always practical, having all your cafe accoutrements \u2014 coffee maker, grinder, beans or grounds, filters, mugs, sweeteners \u2014 in one dedicated place will simplify your morning routine.\n\n15. Character. Whether it's fun, colorful accessories or an unexpected piece of artwork, a kitchen should have an inviting atmosphere that allows for comfort, relaxation and good times.\n\nPlay up your home's interesting architectural details. If you have beautiful old glass-front cabinets, show off some colorful bowls or maybe some vintage glassware. Indulge in little accents, such as quirky doorknobs or vintage curtain tiebacks. These small details add fun, unexpected flair and personality.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 3.2743942737579306, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1354, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.41209075662, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 8, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202180000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.62481536189069, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/01/north-dakota-officials-borrow-4m-slam-feds-on-protest-cost.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [78]}}, "headline": "North Dakota officials borrow $4M, slam feds on protest cost", "wordcount_as_scraped": 640, "date": "20161102000000", "story_content": "BISMARCK, N.D.  \u2013 \u00a0North Dakota leaders agreed Tuesday to borrow another $4 million to cover the escalating costs of policing protests at the Dakota Access pipeline and slammed the federal government for not chipping in part of the funding.\n\nThe state has now run up a $10 million line of credit for law enforcement costs after an emergency spending panel headed by Gov. Jack Dalrymple voted to borrow the additional funds from the state-owned Bank of North Dakota.\n\nDalrymple said officials have asked for contributions from the federal government, the pipeline company, an American Indian tribe, \"and any entity we can think of.\" So far, North Dakota and the local governments it backs have shouldered most of the law enforcement expenses \u2014 even paying for officers from other states that have assisted North Dakota during the protests.\n\nMore than 400 people have been arrested since August at the North Dakota portion of the pipeline, which also crosses through South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois.\n\nAmerican Indians and others who oppose the construction of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners' $3.8 billion pipeline have set up an encampment on U.S. Army Corp of Engineers land without a permit; federal officials have said they wouldn't evict them due to free speech reasons. Opponents worry about potential effects on drinking water on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation and farther downstream on the Missouri River, as well as destruction of cultural artifacts, including burial sites.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Al Carlson called the lack of federal support \"very disturbing\" but said the state \"will always step up for safety.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you how disappointed I am at the lack of support from the Obama administration on an issue that's clearly a federal issue,\" Carlson said.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department and the pipeline company did not immediately respond to email questions from The Associated Press about the state's request for additional money. A call to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe was not immediately returned.\n\nEnergy Transfer Partners has not given the state any money for the protest response. However, Emergency Services spokeswoman Cecily Fong said the pipeline developer has provided a security helicopter that has aided law enforcement and has agreed to use it for medivac services if any officers or protesters sustain serious injuries.\n\nDalrymple issued an emergency declaration in August to cover law enforcement expenses related to protests. The state's Emergency Commission borrowed $6 million from the state-owned Bank of North Dakota in September.\n\nMaj. Gen. Alan Dohrmann, the leader of the state's National Guard, said about $8 million has been spent to date on law enforcement and other costs related to the protests, centered in south-central North Dakota.\n\nMorton County said it has spent an additional $3 million in extra costs. The county may apply for reimbursement from the state.\n\nThe state of North Dakota also is using the emergency appropriations to pay the costs of law officers from other states that have helped with the protest response through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, a national system for sharing personnel during a state of emergency.\n\nThe requesting state is obligated to reimburse responding agencies for reasonable expenses except workers compensation claims, according to the National Emergency Management Association.\n\nState and local officers from South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Nebraska, Wyoming and Ohio have come to the aid of North Dakota. North Dakota's Department of Emergency Services isn't releasing the number of officers, citing \"operational security.\"\n\nMorton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said recently that the out-of-state officers as well as those brought in from around North Dakota are needed so that officers get needed breaks \"so we can maintain a presence in that area.\" The sharing of officers hasn't been well-received in some states, including Minnesota, however. Hundreds of people gathered in the Twin Cities last week to call for the withdrawal of Hennepin County sheriff's deputies.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.76811599731445, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 633, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.4208886767699997, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161102000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.42338072669826, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/13/iran-angered-by-us-sanctions-bill-considers-atomic-boats.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [73]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 513, "scraper_regex": 547}}, "headline": "Iran, angered by US sanctions bill, considers atomic boats", "wordcount_as_scraped": 547, "date": "20161213210000", "story_content": "TEHRAN, Iran \u2013 \u00a0Iran's president on Tuesday ordered officials to draw up plans to build nuclear-powered ships and to show how the United States violated last year's nuclear deal, a response to a vote by the U.S. Congress to extend some sanctions on the country.\n\nGOP REPS VOW TO FIGHT BOEING-IRAN DEAL, AS AIR GIANT MAKES TRUMP-FRIENDLY PITCH\n\nThe move by President Hassan Rouhani came in response to the extension of the Iran Sanctions Act, and was widely seen as posturing that would not affect the landmark nuclear deal concluded with world powers.\n\nThe sanctions act awaits President Barack Obama's signature to become law, and comes amid speculation over how President-elect Donald Trump, a critic of the nuclear deal, will address the issue when he assumes office next month.\n\nSUICIDE NOTE FROM AMERICAN IMPRISONED IN IRAN UNCOVERED\n\nRouhani's letter, read aloud on state television and published by the official IRNA news agency, gave Ali Akbar Salehi of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization three months to come up with a plan for nuclear-powered ships and producing fuel for them. A separate letter ordered Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to \"follow up on the U.S. violations\" of the nuclear deal.\n\nRouhani \"said the measures were warranted in light of the United States' foot-dragging in fulfilling its commitments under the multilateral nuclear deal ... and the recent ratification of anti-Iran legislation in the U.S. Congress,\" state television reported.\n\nForeign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran has sent two letters in recent months to EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini to protest the sanctions legislation, which he called a violation of the nuclear deal, IRNA reported.\n\nThe U.S. bill, first passed by Congress in 1996 and renewed several times since then, allows America to impose economic sanctions on companies for doing business with Iran. It's drawn anger from Iran, which wrote to the United Nations over it and held a high-level meeting last week over how to respond.\n\nThe White House has described the bill as unnecessary but said it didn't violate the international accord signed by six world powers and Iran. Obama is expected to sign it into law ahead of the inauguration of Trump, who has vowed to renegotiate the Iran deal without offering specifics.\n\nThe nuclear deal limits Iran's ability to enrich uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international economic sanctions. It allows Iran to conduct peaceful atomic research.\n\nRouhani's letter did not elaborate on what use the country had for nuclear-powered ships. However, the technology is predominantly used in military applications, like in submarines and aircraft carriers.\n\nIn June 2012, an Iranian admiral was reported as saying the country had begun to design its first nuclear submarine, though the project never came to fruition. Iran has no aircraft carriers, but operates a fleet of conventionally powered Russian and locally made submarines.\n\nIran's move toward nuclear-powered ships appears to be permitted under the nuclear deal, depending on the type of fuel used, said David Mortlock, who once served as director of international economic affairs at the White House National Security Council.\n\n\"Essentially, the deal does not prevent this from happening so long as the nuclear work is done in a particular way, so long as it is transparent and so long as it doesn't cross any lines,\" Mortlock said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.6223776340484597, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 513, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.18938083251, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.3138401559454196, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/12/wannabe-weatherman-set-fire-to-gain-facebook-views-police-say.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [72]}}, "headline": "Wannabe weatherman set fire to gain Facebook views, police say", "wordcount_as_scraped": 633, "date": "20161113020000", "story_content": "ATLANTA \u2013 \u00a0A wannabe weatherman was jailed for arson after admitting he started a wildfire to draw attention to his selfie videos on Facebook, his town's police chief said Friday.

The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire.\n\nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames.\n\nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief.\n\nThe Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\"\n\nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update.\n\nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service announced Friday that the entire Cohutta Wilderness, which stretches across the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia and the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee, has been closed to the public due to multiple fires there.\n\nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response.\n\nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities.\n\nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.87349414825439, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 618, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.59428318854, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161113020000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.0453074433657, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/26/in-early-morning-hours-miami-cubans-hit-streets-to-celebrate-castro-death.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [94], "\u00ed": [7]}}, "headline": "'Cuba s\u00ed, Castro no!'

Honking and strains of salsa music from car stereos echoed against stucco buildings, and fireworks lit up the humid night sky.\n\nPolice blocked off streets leading to Cafe Versailles, the quintessential Cuban American hotspot where strong cafecitos \u2014 sweetened espresso \u2014 were as common as a harsh word about Fidel Castro.\n\n\n\n\"Cuba si! Castro no!\" they chanted, while others screamed \"Cuba libre!\"\n\nCelebration, not grief, permeated the atmosphere. That was no surprise. Castro has cast a shadow over Miami for decades, and in many ways, his policy and his power have shaped the city and its inhabitants.\n\nCubans fled the island to Miami, Tampa, New Jersey and elsewhere after Castro took power in 1959. Some were loyalists of Fulgencio Batista, the president prior to Castro, while others left with the hope they would be able to return soon, after Castro was toppled. He never was.\n\nMany others believed they would not be truly free under Castro and his communist regime. Thousands left behind their possessions, loved ones, and hard-earned educations and businesses, traveling to the U.S. by plane, boat or raft. Many Cubans died on the ocean trip to South Florida. And many never returned to see their childhood homes, their neighborhoods, their playgrounds, their businesses, their cousins and aunts and uncles, because Castro was still in power.\n\nThe ones that made it to Miami took a largely, and vehemently, anti-Castro stance.\n\nOn New Year's Eve every year, Cubans in Miami utter a toast in Spanish as they hoist glasses of liquor: \"Next year in Cuba.\" But as the Cuban exiles aged, and as Castro outlived them, and as U.S. President Barack Obama eroded the embargo and younger Cubans returned to the island, the toast rang silent in many households.\n\nIn Miami, where Havana is closer both geographically and psychologically than Washington, the news of Castro's death was long anticipated by the exiles who left after Castro took power, and in the decades since. Rumors have come and gone for decades, and Castro's death had become something of a joke \u2014 mostly because it seemed to happen so frequently.\n\nThis time, though, it was real.\n\n\"We're all celebrating, this is like a carnival,\" said 72-year-old Jay Fernandez, who came to Miami when he was 18 in 1961. He and his wife and another woman held up a bilingual sign he'd made four years ago when Castro first became ill. \"Satan, Fidel is now yours. Give him what he deserves. Don't let him rest in peace.\"\n\nSeveral blocks away, at the Bay of Pigs memorial, Antonio Hernandez, 76, rode his bicycle up in a light rain and stood at the eternal flame that honors the men who tried, and failed, to wrest Cuba from Castro's grip in 1961.\n\n\"Everybody's happy. Now this guy won't do any more damage,\" said Hernandez, who came to Miami on the Mariel boat lift in 1980. \"His brother will now go down, too. But the world has to pay attention to this, not just we Cubans.\"\n\nWrote Valentin Prieto, a prominent Cuban-American blogger, on Facebook: \"A few hours of sleep tonight is the very last thing fidel castro will ever rob me of.\" In his writings on his blog, Prieto never capitalized Castro's name.\n\nMany Cubans made successful livings and raised families in Miami despite having to learn a new language and start their lives over. Exiles who arrived as teenagers with no money in their pockets became millionaires, political leaders, clergy members, teachers \u2014 influential members contributing to the sturdy fabric of American society.\n\nCemeteries in South Florida abound with the remains of those who fiercely wished Castro had died before them. Their children weep today because they could not see their parents and grandparents return to Cuba under a democratic regime, to see their homeland one more time.\n\nGabriel Morales, a 40-year-old financial executive, monitored social media early Saturday from his home in Miami. His parents both left Cuba decades ago. His father left Cuba before Castro took over, and then returned to visit during Castro's regime. He vowed never to return until the regime changed, Morales said.\n\nMorales' mother left after Castro assumed power; her family had their property appropriated by the government, Morales said.\n\n\"Feels weird,\" Morales said in a text message to an Associated Press reporter. \"Been waiting to hear this news all my life. Seems unreal.\"\n\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 20, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.76056337356567, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 765, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.66269509178, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161126110000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.5294117647058796, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/03/gutfeld-sully-could-be-last-human-heroes.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [184, 297, 381, 512, 619, 730, 897, 1022, 1025, 1456, 1478, 1552, 1730, 1753, 1881, 1936, 1961, 1981, 2114, 2246, 2568, 2794, 3093, 3190, 3196, 3204, 3258, 3264, 3279, 3398, 3467, 3488, 3887, 3912, 3982, 4324, 4381, 4619, 4700, 4812, 5178, 5266, 5603, 5876]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 951, "scraper_regex": 1029}}, "headline": "Gutfeld: Sully could be the last of the human heroes", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1029, "date": "20170103210000", "story_content": "First, I offer you a review of the movie \"Sully\" \u2014 and don't worry, there aren't any spoilers.\n\nBecause you know how the story goes:\u00a0Birds hit plane. Engines fail. Pilot, nicknamed \"Sully,\" lands plane on Hudson. Everyone lives. Sully is a hero.\u00a0\n\nSo how do you make a movie out of something when everyone knows how it turns out?\u00a0\n\nYes, you can bring up the success of the film \"Titanic,\" but it's not like there was actual footage of that disaster on YouTube.\u00a0How are you going to tell us a story we already know \u2014 and have already seen \u2014 on local and national news?\u00a0\n\nThe answer is to create a new enemy. Even if the enemy is innocent.\n\nThis is no longer about a man making an\u00a0emergency landing. It's about a man facing pesky investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board who suspect the emergency landing was due to pilot error.\u00a0\n\nSince the film came out, the members of that safety board have said they were never trying to corner Sully, that they were\u00a0in\u00a0his corner from the start. They believe, like everyone else, that Sully is a true hero.\n\nBut since that makes for a boring flick, Hollywood needs to create a villain: the investigators, who try to pin blame on the pilot. It's the kind of acceptable mess that movies make of real-life events.\n\nSo now the investigators wonder why Sully didn't just turn back to La Guardia, especially when their flight simulators show it's possible\u00a0to land there safely.\u00a0It's not about Sully being right. It's about him being wrong, then lucky.\u00a0Could it be that Sully put all those lives in danger before he saved them?\n\nThat's why I'd like to choose a different villain in this film: the flight simulator \u2014 or rather, its\u00a0algorithm ... its only\u00a0sin being to reduce death.\n\nThe movie, to me, isn't about an emergency landing. It's about the coming end of human control, and\u00a0Sully trying to prove that man is still necessary in a\u00a0world run by algorithms.\u00a0It's the algorithms\u00a0that say Sully could have made it back to the airport safely if only he thought like an algorithm \u2014 like a machine, without emotion.\u00a0\n\nBut because Sully is human, he made the decision \u2014 using life experience and gut instinct \u2014 to land on water and save 155 people.\u00a0\n\nBut what we are now learning in the age of the algorithm is that human instinct isn't exactly the answer. Need proof? Use Siri or Waze, which we rely on for answers, provided by algorithms (not our gut). How funny: You rely on math for directions to a club, but you rely on your gut for picking a doctor, a mate, a car!\u00a0Perhaps there are algorithms involved in those choices, too, and we just don't see them.\n\n\"Sully's\" upbeat message is that we still need humans. It was the heroically human Sully who saved those people, not some cold equation\u00a0written on a chalkboard. It was a human who decided to land in the river and save everyone. If a computer had decided to go back to La Guardia, everyone might have died \u2014 simply because it never factored in the time spent for the human calculations made after the point of crisis.\n\nSully is a hero.\u00a0But as we hand over most of our vital decisions to machines, he could be the last of our beloved\u00a0human\u00a0heroes.\u00a0The only reason Sully is a hero is that we humans are\u00a0still\u00a0allowed in the\u00a0decision-making process. Our next Sully might live on a chip.\n\nOddly \u2014 as machines take over \u2014 the fewer opportunities\u00a0there are for human-derived heroism, the more likely it is that more\u00a0lives will be saved.\u00a0Once we realize machine thinking is preferable, people like Sully won't be saving our lives, because our lives will be cradled by infallible equations in silicon.\n\nI'm not talking planes anymore. I'm talking driverless cars. Can we face the reality that machines are just better drivers, and that 35,000 dead souls every year (in the U.S. alone) may no longer die once we hand the wheel over to the\u00a0unconscious, algorithmic\u00a0minds of wheel-based androids in which we recline on our way to work?\u00a0\n\nThe heroes then become not drivers or pilots \u2014 but those who program the algorithms. And in time, the heroes are the algorithms themselves, once they learn to do it themselves.\n\nThe world becomes safer and safer: fewer plane crashes, car crashes and medical mishaps at hospitals. The upside: In every arena where human error is diminished,\u00a0everyone lives longer. The downside: fewer movie heroes.\u00a0\n\nCase in point: Some are already panicking that there will be a lack of organ donors once self-driving cars take over. With fewer accidents, there will be fewer fresh corpses from which to harvest healthy organs. The dead no longer save\u00a0lives, because the dead are still alive. It's great news that leads to bad news.\u00a0As machines take over the decision-making that saves lives, we are left with fewer chances to save lives later.\u00a0With less roadkill, the organ market starves.\n\nThat might not be the only loss.\n\nIf you subtract human thinking from an equation, do you, over time, lose beneficial abilities expressed by Sully as he landed on the Hudson? For example, if we adopt driverless cars, will we evolve into animals that lack the instinctual abilities to pay attention? If we don't need to\u00a0watch the road, will we lose the skills to spot obstacles, and the skills to make quick\u00a0decisions to avoid them? Will we even need these skills anymore?\n\nI have no clue. But as we upgrade technology to make our lives better and safer, we may diminish human qualities that are helpful in other arenas.\n\nPerhaps, then, Sully is more than a hero.

In Havana and across the island, people signed condolence books and an oath of loyalty to Castro's sweeping May 2000 proclamation of the Cuban revolution as an unending battle for socialism, nationalism and an outsize role for the island on the world stage.\n\n\"I feel a deep sadness, but immense pride in having had him near,\" said Ana Beatriz P\u00e9rez, a 50-year-old medical researcher who was advancing in the slow-moving line with the help of crutches. \"His physical departure gives us strength to continue advancing in his ideology. This isn't going away, because we are millions.\"\n\n\"His death is another revolution,\" said her husband, Fidel D\u00edaz, who predicted that it will prompt many to \"rediscover the ideas of the commander for the new generations.\"\n\nTribute sites were set up in hundreds of places across the island as the government urged Cubans to reaffirm their belief in a socialist, single-party system that in recent years has struggled to maintain the fervor that was widespread at the triumph of the 1959 revolution.\n\nMany mourners came on their own accord, but thousands were sent in groups by the communist government, which still employs about 80 percent of the working people in Cuba despite the growth of the private sector under Ra\u00fal.\n\nInside the memorial, thousands walked through three rooms with near-identical displays featuring the 1962 Alberto Korda photograph of the young Castro in the Sierra Maestra mountains, bouquets of white flowers and an array of Castro's medals against a black backdrop, framed by honor guards of soldiers and children in school uniforms. The ashes of the 90-year-old former president did not appear to be on display.\n\nSigns read: \"The Cuban Communist Party is the only legitimate heir of the legacy and authority of the commander in chief of the Cuban Revolution, comrade Fidel Castro.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, commander. Your ideas remain here with us,\" 64-year-old retiree Etelbina P\u00e9rez said between sobs, dabbing at her eyes with a brown handkerchief. \"I feel great pain over his death. I owe my entire life to him. He brought me out of the mountains. I was able to study thanks to him.\"\n\nThe scene was played out on a smaller scale at countless places across the country.\n\nAfter 10 years of leadership by Ra\u00fal Castro, a relatively camera-shy and low-key successor, Cuba has found itself riveted once again by the words and images of the man who dominated the lives of generations.\u00a0\n\nSince his death on Friday night, state-run newspapers, television and radio have run wall-to-wall tributes to Fidel Castro, broadcasting non-stop footage of his speeches, interviews and foreign trips, interspersed with adulatory remembrances by prominent Cubans.\n\nThe reception to the news of Castro's death among Cuban-Americans in Miami, on the other hand, has been joyous, and a number of politicians have been careful not to appear to be praising the communist strongman too eagerly.\n\nIn announcing the administration figures attending the service, Earnest was at pains to point out that Rhodes was already scheduled to be on the island this week. He said that Rhodes' and DeLaurentis' attendance is \"an appropriate way to show respect,\" while acknowledging the differences that remain between the two nations.\n\nBased on reporting by the Associated Press.\n\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.32502707839012107, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 850, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.20546672953, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161129210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.05882352941176, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/15/from-catfish-to-kombucha-its-not-just-obamacare-that-conservatives-want-trump-to-repeal.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [425, 476, 495, 1141, 4482]}}, "headline": "From catfish to kombucha: It's not just Obamacare that conservatives want Trump to repeal", "wordcount_as_scraped": 669, "date": "20161216230000", "story_content": "Tis the season. As children across the nation write to Santa to tell him what they want to find under the tree on Christmas morning, a group of the House's staunchest conservatives sent President-elect Donald Trump a wish list of regulations enacted by Barack Obama that they want to see scrapheaped.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep.\u00a0Mark Meadows, R-N.C., gave Trump's transition team\u00a0a 21-page document\u00a0listing the federal rules, regulations and executive orders implemented under Obama that the caucus wants either revoked or revised.\n\n\"These last 8 years, we have seen a disturbing trend of the federal government unnecessarily inserting themselves more and more into the lives of hardworking Americans \u2013 and the results have been economically disastrous,\" Meadows said in a statement. \"When the American people spoke on Nov. 8, they provided conservatives with an opportunity to restore order in our government and to remove the out-of-control bureaucratic red tape that so often stunts the growth of otherwise successful American [businesses].\"\u00a0\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump promised to loosen government restrictions, and the Freedom Caucus intends to hold the president-elect to that vow.\n\nTheir list includes all the usual suspects that have frustrated GOP lawmakers during the last eight years \u2013 the Affordable Care Act, the Export-Import Bank and Obama's environmental initiatives.\n\nBut among the 228 items are some more obscure regulations like ones on catfish, breath mints and kombucha.\n\nCatfish\n\nIn 2008, driven by increased competition from Asia, the domestic catfish industry asked for more government regulation. Congress agreed and planned to switch the inspection of both foreign- and domestically-raised catfish from the Food and Drug Administration to the more stringent Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe transition, however, has taken eight years (and counting), and catfish producers are worried that the new inspection process will hurt an already beleaguered industry and cost hundreds of jobs in the rural South.\n\nThe FDA's catfish inspection program costs taxpayers $700,000 per year; the USDA regulations will run taxpayers $14 million annually, plus an additional $20 million in one-time implementation costs.\n\nCeiling fans\n\nThe administration has put conservation standards on everything from air conditioners to ovens as part of its energy and environmental plan.\n\nWhile the Freedom Caucus takes offense with pretty much all of them, they reserve a special disdain for the standards placed on ceiling fans, which has cost taxpayers around $2.4 million.\n\n\"The conservation rules are a part of the green agenda being pushed by the left,\" Meadow's report to Trump stated. \"They're costly, benefit only certain providers and dramatically affect markets like real estate and construction.\"\n\nBreath mints\n\nThe White House's push for Americans to eat more healthily drew fire throughout Meadow's report, but the FDA's expanding labelling regulations to smaller and smaller packaging, including breath mints, really took the cake.\n\n\"The Food and Drug Administration is amending its labelling regulations for conventional foods and dietary supplements to provide updated nutrition information on the label to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices,\" the report said. \"This rule places regulations on the serving size of breath mints.\"\n\nThe report notes that these regulations cost between $200,000 and $800,000 a year.\n\nSonic boom\n\nIt's been a long time since many Americans actually heard a sonic boom \u2013 the sound created when a plane hits Mach 1, or 761 miles per hour. That's because the Federal Aviation Administration has banned supersonic flights over U.S. territory.\n\nSome say that the fuel consumed in supersonic flight makes it not worth lifting the ban, but the Freedom Caucus does not agree.\n\nIn its recommendations, the caucus gave one, simple recommendation: \"Make sonic boom again.\"\n\nKombucha\n\nWhat's do the members of the Freedom Caucus and hipsters in Brooklyn have in common?\n\nApparently, it's a love for kombucha, the fermented tea drink much in vogue on both coasts of the U.S.\n\nThe caucus wants the federal government's rules for shipping alcoholic beverages revised.\n\n\"The threshold to be able to ship products containing alcohol should be elevated in order to support the growing kombucha industry,\" the report noted.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.378787875175476, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 640, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.1642044068100001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.5625, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/24/decision-looms-on-assange-extradition-to-sweden.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [59, 2532], "\u00bd": [380]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 621, "scraper_regex": 653}}, "headline": "Decision looms on Assange extradition to Sweden", "wordcount_as_scraped": 653, "date": "20170124160000", "story_content": "STOCKHOLM \u2013 \u00a0Swedish authorities are getting closer to either indicting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on rape charges stemming from an incident in August 2010 or letting it drop, Fox News has learned.\n\nA decision could come in a matter of a few months, an eyeblink in the context of an international saga that has dragged on for 6\u00bd years. The latest development follows a November interview a Swedish prosecutor conducted with Assange at his self-imposed exile in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, an interrogation many say was long overdue.\n\n\"If I was in charge, I would have tried very hard to have him interviewed in a very, very early possible period,\" former Swedish prosecutor Sven-ErikAlhem told Fox News.\n\nWhile no one knows exactly what evidence Swedish prosecutors have, experts told Fox News the third-degree rape case against Assange, which included consensual sex at the time, could be a difficult charge to make\n\n\"You need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did it,\" legal expert Marten Schultz said. \"This is difficult to prove.\"\n\nASSANGE SAYS HE STANDS BY PLEDGE TO COME TO US\n\nWithin Sweden, where people are highly sensitive to sexual-assault cases, there is concern that even if Assange is charged, he might try to wait out the statute of limitations. Under Swedish law, he would have to avoid prosecution for another three years.\n\n\"I think people will be upset if the person can stay away so long and then not be charged,\" women's rights lawyer Elina Lindner said.\n\nThe sexual-assault case is separate from Assange's controversial work with WikiLeaks, which has included publishing millions of sensitive documents that the Pentagon claims put American service members and intelligence operatives in danger and emails that rocked the 2016 presidential campaign. Assange's supporters have claimed the sexual assault case was brought to silence him. Assange himself has claimed that Washington has manipulated the case to get him to the U.S. to face alleged espionage charges.\n\nThe 45-year-old native Australian founded WikiLeaks in 2006 as an online publisher of leaked documents obtained from whistle-blowers.\n\nThe rape and sexual-assault allegations stem from an August 2010 appearance in Sweden during which he had sex with two women. The sex charges were made by prosecutors based on the women's testimony. The case was dropped, then picked up again. Assange was questioned regarding some of the charges and was permitted to leave the country.\u00a0\n\nIn June 2012, Assange applied for and was granted asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. At the time, he said he was not motivated by the pending charge in Sweden, but by concern that extradition there would lead to his being sent to the U.S.\n\nSwedish officials told Fox News there is no extradition order on file to send Assange to the U.S. if he is brought to Sweden. Such an extradition maneuver would be difficult under Swedish law, experts said.\n\nAssange previously said he would willingly come to the U.S. and face possible espionage charges if Chelsea Manning, the former Army private who supplied WikiLeaks with highly classified documents, was pardoned. Although President Obama did in fact pardon Manning last week, it appears unlikely that Assange will make good on his pledge.\n\nIn a social media press conference Thursday, Assange said if he goes it would happen only after Manning's scheduled May release and he would only come to the U.S. to discuss the case with Justice Department officials if his rights were \"protected.\"\n\nFor now, the most likely venue for Assange to face justice remains Sweden, where there is an extradition order and a charge being investigated.\n\n\"He should look at a map,\" Thomas Mattsson, editor-in-chief of the Stockholm daily newspaper Expressen told Fox News. \"He should go in the opposite direction.\"\n\n\n\nGreg Palkot currently serves as a London-based senior foreign affairs correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).

interfere in our elections and attempted to subvert our democracy.\n\nWe must respond to this unprecedented intrusion decisively\u2014and in a manner that will make Russia think twice about doing it again.\u00a0\n\nBut even more importantly, we should recognize that weakness invites aggression.\n\nThese hacks were the culmination of a failed foreign policy, namely the Obama administration's blindness to the threat from Moscow and unwillingness to deter our adversaries.\n\nRecall President Obama's response to Mitt Romney's assertion in the 2012 presidential debates that Russia was our \"number one geopolitical foe.\"\n\n\"The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,\" Obama scoffed at Mr. Romney.\u00a0 \"The Cold War's been over for 20 years.\"\n\nThat combination\u2014of willful ignorance and hesitation\u2014is the bedrock of the Obama administration's \"look-the-other-way\" national security strategy.\u00a0 And look where it got us.\n\nWhen the Russians invaded our ally, Ukraine, Obama refused to arm them to rebuff the illegal incursion.\n\nPutin himself must have been surprised by the muted response.\n\nA year later, Russia brazenly intervened in Syria to turn the tide of war in favor of a brutal, anti-America despot slaughtering his own people.\u00a0 Again, Obama faltered.\n\nNow the situation in Syria looks more intractable than ever, and we've lost most of our leverage.\n\nPresident Obama defends his foreign policy approach as \"strategic patience.\"\u00a0 But when the leader of the free world stands on the sidelines, our allies and our adversaries see only weakness.\n\nMake no mistake:\u00a0 Putin was emboldened by American indecision, which is why he felt confident enough to intrude in our democratic process.\n\nThe seriousness of Russian meddling transcends party lines.\u00a0 Moscow's efforts may have disproportionately targeted Democrats, but next time it could just as easily be Republicans.\n\nEither way, it cannot be tolerated.\n\nYet instead of responding, Obama administration aides appear more focused on mocking President-elect Donald Trump for expressing uncertainty about the hacking claims.\n\nBut this isn't about Mr. Trump, who was not commander-in-chief when these intrusions took place.\n\nThe man sitting in the Oval Office during this crisis was Barack Obama, who received a stream of sensitive updates on the hacks throughout the general election and had the power to take action.\n\nSo why did he do nothing?\u00a0 This is the real scandal.\n\nPresident Obama failed to deter Russian aggression time and again, and so far, he has been negligent in responding to it right here at home.\n\nIn fact, despite knowing Russia was trying to interfere in our election months ago, he waited until weeks afterwards\u2014once his candidate was defeated\u2014to even offer strong words about a potential U.S. response.\n\nThe delay is disturbing.\n\nWhen I was first briefed on this behind closed doors, I urged administration officials to start pushing back against Moscow.\u00a0 But they demurred.\n\nAs a result, the Putin regime has learned there are no consequences for their actions.\n\nThere is an important lesson here for future presidents:\u00a0 if we do not shape the world around us, we will be shaped by it.\u00a0 That is why we need to project strength to protect our homeland.\n\nWe must immediately restore American power to deter adversaries like Russia from taking advantage of us.\u00a0\n\nWe also cannot hesitate to advance U.S. interests abroad, nor should we apologize for it.\u00a0\n\nWhile there is always a chance that our actions will cause backlash, it is guaranteed that inaction will create a world that is more dangerous for America.\n\nSadly, Obama's hesitation has taught our foes a very different lesson:\u00a0 America can be bullied, our elections can be targeted, and our democracy is open to attack by feckless despots.\u00a0\n\nThat is the staggering price of \"strategic patience.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\nRepublican Michael McCaul, represents Texas' 10th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Chris Christie and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, two leading supporters. He's also scheduled to meet with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach.\n\nA Kobach spokeswoman told The Associated Press on Saturday that Kobach was on his way to New Jersey but she did not confirm details of the planned meeting Sunday. Kobach served as an adviser to the Trump campaign on immigration issues and has a background in designing laws cracking down people who are here illegally.\n\nRomney, a former GOP presidential nominee, said the 90-minute meeting at Trump's private club in Bedminster, N.J., was a \"far-reaching conversation.\" He did not respond to questions about whether he would consider joining the administration.\n\nTrump walked Romney out at the end of the meeting and said, \"It went great.\"\n\nThe sit-down came after an acrimonious election year. Romney was a harsh critic of Trump, calling him a \"con man.\" Trump called Romney a \"choke artist\" because of his loss to President Barack Obama.

The lawsuits alleged the school misled students and failed to deliver on its promises in programs that cost up to $35,000.\n\nTrump has denied the allegations and had said repeatedly he would not settle. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who announced the settlement, called it \"a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.\"\n\nTrump tweeted to his 15 million followers Saturday that he settled only so that he could better focus on leading the U.S.\n\nTrump is still weighing a range of candidates for leading national security posts. \n\nOther contenders for secretary of state are said to be Giuliani, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who met with Trump on Thursday.\n\nAlso on Friday, Trump picked Alabama Sen.

Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, signaling a sharp rightward shift in U.S. security policy as he begins to form his Cabinet.\n\nTrump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. A former military intelligence chief, Flynn has accused the Obama administration of being too soft on terrorism and has cast Islam as a \"political ideology\" and driver of extremism.\n\nThe selections form the first outlines of Trump's Cabinet and national security teams. Given his lack of governing experience and vague policy proposals during the campaign, his selection of advisers is being scrutinized both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nTrump's initial decisions suggest a more aggressive military involvement in counterterror strategy and a greater emphasis on Islam's role in stoking extremism.\n\nSessions, who is best known for his hardline immigration views, has questioned whether terrorist suspects should benefit from the rights available in U.S. courts. Pompeo has said Muslim leaders are \"potentially complicit\" in attacks if they do not denounce violence carried out in the name of Islam.\n\nPompeo's nomination to lead the CIA also opens the prospect of the U.S. resuming torture of detainees. Trump has backed harsh interrogation techniques that President Barack Obama and Congress have banned, saying the U.S. \"should go tougher than waterboarding,\" which simulates drowning. In 2014, Pompeo criticized Obama for \"ending our interrogation program\" and said intelligence officials \"are not torturers, they are patriots.\"\n\nAsked Saturday whether more anymore announcements would be made in the coming hours, Trump said, \"We'll see, could happen.\"\n\nSessions and Pompeo would both require Senate confirmation; Flynn would not.\n\nHowever, potential roadblocks exist, particularly for Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump and one of the chamber's most conservative members.\n\nHis last Senate confirmation hearing, in 1986 for a federal judgeship, was derailed over allegations that he made racist comments, including calling a black assistant U.S. attorney \"boy\" in conversation. Sessions denied the accusation, but withdrew from consideration.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.9278130531311, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 868, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.0, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161120160000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.53456221198157, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/08/brexit-dominates-uk-politics-from-supreme-court-to-commons.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [68]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 788, "scraper_regex": 844}}, "headline": "Brexit dominates UK politics, from Supreme Court to Commons", "wordcount_as_scraped": 844, "date": "20161208140000", "story_content": "LONDON \u2013 \u00a0The drama of Britain's exit from the European Union was being acted out this week on two of London's grandest stages \u2014 the Supreme Court and the House of Commons chamber. The plot is gripping, but the ending is still a mystery.\n\nInside the Supreme Court building, lawyers argued before the country's top judges about who has the power to trigger the EU exit \u2014 lawmakers or the government. In the House of Commons, a stones' throw away on the other side of Parliament Square, British legislators debated when that should happen and how it should unfold.\n\nAlmost six months after Britons voted in a referendum to leave the EU, some aspects of the way forward are clear, but many remain uncertain.\n\nTHERE'S A TIMETABLE BUT NOT A ROADMAP\n\nLawmakers voted Wednesday evening to back Prime Minister Theresa May's March 31 deadline to start the U.K's. formal exit from the EU, after the government agreed to publish details of its negotiating plan.\n\nMay's Conservative government has been reluctant to reveal much about its strategy or goals, saying that would weaken its hand in negotiations with the EU. But facing defeat on an opposition motion calling for it to disclose more details, the government agreed to publish \"strategic plans\" \u2014 though it's not clear how detailed they will be.\n\nIn return, most opposition lawmakers voted to state Parliament's support for triggering two years of EU exit talks by March 31.\n\nBoth pro- and anti-Brexit forces are claiming the result as a victory. Labour Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said the opposition was bringing \"clarity, scrutiny and accountability\" to the divorce process. Anti-EU Conservative lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith said the Commons had given the government a \"blank check\" for Brexit.\n\nThe vote is largely symbolic, however. The government says the motion is non-binding and does not affect the Supreme Court case.\n\n___\n\nTHE BALL IS IN THE JUDGES' COURT\n\nThe immediate future of the Brexit process rests in the hands of 11 Supreme Court justices.\n\nIn a four-day hearing that ends Thursday, they are being asked to rule on a major constitutional issue: Does the power to take Britain out of the EU rest with the executive \u2014 May's government \u2014 or with Parliament?\n\nThe government argues it can use powers known as royal prerogative to invoke Article 50 of the EU's key treaty, the formal trigger for exit talks from the 28-nation bloc. Prerogative powers have been used for centuries \u2014 originally by monarchs, now by politicians \u2014 to join or leave international treaties without a vote in Parliament.\n\nLawyers challenging the government say leaving the EU will change Britain's laws and remove citizens' rights, including free movement within the bloc \u2014 and that can't be done without legislation in Parliament.\n\nDavid Pannick, lawyer for lead claimant Gina Miller, said British law contains \"scores, hundreds of statutes which implement EU law,\" and these cannot be wiped away by \"a minister acting without parliamentary authority.\"\n\nThe case is further complicated by Britain's regional structure. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have their own legislatures, and lawyers have argued to the court that they, too, should get a say.\n\nScotland's top law officer, James Wolffe, told the court Thursday that \"fundamentally, this case is about who has the power to change the law of the land.\"\n\nENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE?\n\nThis case is considered so important that it is being heard by all 11 Supreme Court justices, the first time that has happened since the court was established in 2009.\n\nSome pro-Brexit folks think the judges are exceeding their authority by considering the case at all. The Daily Mail has branded the justices \"enemies of the people.\"\n\nInside the court, the legal argument has been restrained, elegant and intellectual, ranging from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to a dispute over Newfoundland lobster fishing.\n\nBut outside \u2014 and online \u2014 the case has inflamed the debate over Brexit with venom and vitriol. Miller, one of the claimants in the case against the government, says she has received online abuse and death threats.\n\nOpening the hearing on Monday, the court's top judge, David Neuberger, said the case is about legal issues, not politics.\n\n\"As judges, our duty is to consider those issues impartially, and to decide the case according to the law,\" he said.\n\nUNCERTAIN NEW YEAR\n\nThe Supreme Court judges say they will give their ruling in January. If the government loses, it will have to introduce legislation to trigger Article 50 \u2014 and it won't have much time to get it through the House of Commons and the House of Lords if it wants to meet the March 31 deadline.\n\nMost pro-EU British lawmakers have said they will not try to overturn the referendum result by blocking Brexit. But they could seek to amend the legislation in a bid to soften the divorce terms and avert a \"hard Brexit\" in which Britain crashes out of the EU's tariff-free single market in goods and services.\n\nAnd the unelected Lords, where May's Conservatives do not have a majority, could try to delay the bill.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jill lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.87018704414368, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 788, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.8108408788599997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.6649746192893398, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/25/portugal-offer-to-take-iraqi-refugees-rebuffed-as-favoritism.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [87]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 754, "scraper_regex": 806}}, "headline": "Portugal offer to take Iraqi refugees rebuffed as favoritism", "wordcount_as_scraped": 806, "date": "20170125110000", "story_content": "AGIOS ATHANASIOS, Greece \u2013 \u00a0As a member of a persecuted minority in Iraq, 24-year-old Shaker Mahie has seen his people massacred, raped and scattered across a new continent. Now, the Yazidi \u2014 whose faith is older than Christianity \u2014 are at the center of a new European dilemma.\n\nPortugal has offered to take in several hundred of the 2,500 Yazidi refugees living in Greece, arguing that their mistreated community merits special protection. Athens has rejected the offer, worried that other countries might start cherry-picking asylum applications based on religion or ethnicity.\n\nDoes that make the Yazidis victims of discrimination or nondiscrimination? It's a question that could be keeping some of them in limbo.\n\nAna Gomes, a European Parliament member from Portugal who has been an outspoken advocate of the resettlement proposal, says Greek concerns are misplaced. Yazidis, she noted, were targeted for slaughter by Islamic State militants at home and face ongoing harassment from fellow Iraqis stranded in migrant camps.\n\n\"These people have been victims of negative discrimination in resettlement to other European countries when they should be having positive discrimination in recognition of the barbarity they have suffered,\" Gomes told the Associated Press after returning from a visit to refugee camps in Greece.\n\nThe dispute comes as the European Union wrestles with how to protect the most vulnerable refugees while making sure that member nations are sharing the cost of taking in newcomers. Delays and political obstruction have impeded an emergency relocation program meant to ease the disproportionate load carried by Italy and Greece.\n\nOver centuries, Yazidis have been the victims of purges by rulers who regarded their religious symbols and practices as devil worship. Islamic State militants used the same explanation when they targeted the insular community for conversion and elimination.\n\nIraq's remote Sijar region, the Yazidi minority's heartland, is where thousands of civilians were massacred and thousands more fled in 2014. The United Nations has described the attacks as genocide.\n\nIn a small hotel room near the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, Mahie watches his son and daughter play on the floor with a toy dump truck, and struggles to find words to recount the horrors witnessed by his young family. He remembers IS fighters entering his village two years ago.\n\n\"They (took) girls and women and killed the men,\" he said.\n\nHe and his family fled into the mountains of Sijar before crossing into Turkey and paying smugglers to get them to Greece.\n\nThe Yazidis' recent plight has been highlighted by the revelations of women being captured by IS fighters for sexual slavery. Two Yazidi women, Nadia Murad and Lamiya Aji Bashar, received an annual award for human rights last month from the European Parliament.\n\nBut old prejudices also have followed the Yazidi to Europe, where they have reported being attacked by other refugees at camps and are often housed separately.\n\n\"We take the issue of Yazidis very seriously because they have suffered such violence and persecution. We are doing everything we can to ensure their protection,\" Greek Migration Minister Yannis Mouzalas told The Associated Press.\n\nGreece says more than 60,000 refugees and migrants who arrived there hoping to make it further into Europe are stranded in the country, after EU and Balkan countries closed their borders last year. Athens is struggling to shelter them over the winter and pressing other European Union countries to honor relocation commitments.\n\nPortugal so far has taken in about half of the 1,618 asylum-seekers it pledged to accept under the EU's embattled relocation scheme. Nevertheless, it's Yazidi-specific invitation is unacceptable, Mouzalas said.\n\n\"No government can discriminate on a racial basis,\" he said. \"And those making a lot of noise around this issue are not helping the Yazidis.\"\n\nYazidi refugees themselves are split on the offer from Portugal. Some worry about further dispersing the members of a minority group thought to number only several hundred thousand worldwide.\n\n\"I don't want to go to Portugal,\" Mahie said. \"My mother and my brother are in Germany and my father is in Iraq. It's difficult for one family someone to (be) in this country and someone to (be) in another country.\"\n\nTo others, the idea of a safe haven is appealing.\n\nLike Mahie, Riad Salo sought refuge from IS in the mountains of Sinjar; his father-in-law died there. The younger of Salo's two daughters, Xzidxan, was born in a tent at a refugee camp near Mount Olympus in northern Greece.\n\nSalo said he feared continued persecution from other Iraqis even if another EU country agrees to relocate his family.\n\n\"I don't want to go to a country where there are many (other refugees),\" he said. \"I want to go to Portugal because it's very safe.\"\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nU.N. rights panel conclusion on IS group attacks: http://bit.ly/2jfoBCG\n\n___\n\nDerek Gatopoulos in Athens contributed.

That was a media scream that registered 11 on the Richter scale as Republican Donald Trump defied media demands and went on to win the presidential election in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump to concede.\n\nA nearly unanimous media failed to carry the unpopular Hillary across the finish line. Once again, America rejected the liberal Democrat. Advil set the tone early with a comment: \"Politics giving you a #migraine? Advil\u00ae Migraine is the best candidate for pain relief.\" CNN commentator David Axelrod called it a \"primal scream.\" ABC's Terry Moran called it \"a rejection of the\u00a0neoliberal world order that has\u00a0been the consensus around the\u00a0world.\" CNN commentator and former Obama green jobs czar Van Jones called the election a \"White-lash against a changing country.\"\n\nWhen it appeared that Hillary would not concede, after campaign chairman John Podesta appeared before her supporters in Manhattan and told everyone to go home and get some rest, even some in media criticized her. USA Today Washington correspondent Paul Singer was typical: \"Stunned that @HillaryClinton did not concede. If @realDonaldTrump pulled that, people would go bananas.\"\n\nThe election was a national rejection of both the traditional media and the Hollywood elite who piled on money, endorsements, appearances and offensive videos telling people to vote. Celebrities went full-on insane. Actor Mark Ruffalo vowed to do a nude scene if Clinton won. Madonna said she would perform oral sex on Clinton voters. It was so overboard that it might well have caused voters to just say no to all of star media.\n\nThe night went from what CNN's Wolf Blitzer called a \"real nail-biter\" to one his co-anchor Jake Tapper said is, \"going to put the polling industry out of business.\" Left-wing Fusion referred to a \"Terrifying/exciting state-by-state #ElectionNight.\" The New York Times prediction tracker went from overwhelmingly predicting a Clinton win to 94 percent for Trump as the clock neared 11 p.m. Even when Hillary won Virginia, the Times was sending out downbeat emails saying she \"preserved a slim path to victory.\"\n\nTrump supporter and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee joked: \"Wouldn't wanna be under that giant glass ceiling if Hillary is forced to concede. That party might end like Carrie's prom.\" Fox News contributor and commentator Richard Grenell blasted the news media. \"The media is for sure losing tonight no matter who pulls this off. How wrong they were.\"\n\nWhat media and pollsters had predicted would be an early night turned into a long contest. Around 8:40 p.m., liberals and media staff started to panic. Huffington Post Senior Political Reporter and Politics Managing Editor Amanda Terkel showed the tension. \"Office debate right now: 'Trump might win!' 'Trump ain't going to win.'\"\n\nBy 9 pm ET it spread. CNN commentator Sally Kohn showed the typical liberal reaction. \"IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS CLOSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Former CBS anchor Dan Rather summed it up. \"Nearing cardiac arrest time for team Clinton.\" Global Editorial Director, The Huffington Post's\u00a0Howard Fineman said what was on many lips: \"This is starting -- starting -- to look like an American #Brexit.\"\n\nThe media pointed fingers at FBI head James Comey. Pundit Michael Smerconish\u00a0blamed him for the vote. \"Changing my @TIME 2016 person of yr prediction (who most influenced news) to James Comey #ElectionNight.\" Atlantic Senior Editor Adam Serwer put it succinctly: \"Congrats to the New York FBI office.\" He went further later: \"Congratulations to Vladimir Putin, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\"\n\nAtlantic Senior Editor David Frum found another villain \u2013 Russia. \"We may be living through the most successful Russian intelligence operation since the Rosenbergs stole the A-bomb.\"\n\nDaily Beast columnist Jonathan Alter blamed it on masculinity. \"Trump didn't win because of Comey. He won because he's a testosterone candidate and men weren't ready for a woman president.\" He continued to hammer out hyperbole: \"America has never faced such a crisis before. World War II was 4 years but US always fairly sure we would win. This will be a new menace.\"\n\nJournalists had earlier celebrated as Hillary broke the \"the glass ceiling.\" ABC gave up all pretense of neutrality and had former Clinton staffer and Clinton Foundation contributor George Stephanopoulos moderate election night coverage. Comedian Emo Phillips reflected Hollywood's agenda in one short Tweet: \"I don't get it. We had all the funny tweets.\"\n\nThe New York Times showed that media bias remained an issue into election night, writing that, \"an intense public distrust in the media is threatening the networks' traditional role as election night scorekeeper.\" In a think piece discussion about coverage of the race, the Times controversial media columnist Jim Rutenberg said Trump, \"received coverage of a billionaire reality-television star who turned politics into performance art.\"\n\nHe followed that up with one of the worst media bubble comments of the election: \"The press needs to explore the frustration of those many Americans who think free trade's gone too far; that immigration threatens the national fabric; and that insiders from Washington, Wall Street and the media have rigged the system against them.\"\n\nElection Day brought out the strange in the media, as well. CBS Evening News veteran Bob Schieffer wondered if the nation were \"enduring some kind of curse.\" He added in nice biblical metaphor: \"What should we expect next \u2013 that it will rain frogs? I wouldn't bet against it.\"\n\nPollster Nate Silver crowed early because he had been criticized for giving Trump a better chance to win the World Series than Trump had of becoming president. The Cubs won. \"This doesn't seem like an election in which one candidate had a 99% chance of winning tbh,\" he Tweeted.\n\nWashington Post quasi-conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin bashed the GOP in her election day screed, urging Republicans to help Clinton succeed. \"Do I think all this is likely? No, but then we are among the thousands of center-right Americans who think the solution to the sclerotic GOP may very well be a new political party.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, The Washington Post described the ballot with a mountain full of understatement: \"An acrimonious race reaches an endpoint.\" Of course, the Post probably described WWII as an international disagreement.\n\nThe foreign press chimed in, too. German newspapers warned of a \"Trumpocalypse\" and called the GOP candidate a \"Horror-Clown.\" The Daily Mail described the vote as, \"Clinton, Trump fight for soul of divided US before vote.\"\n\nFar left media grew more bizarre as the day went on. Huffington Post featured a story headlined: \"I Voted With My Vagina And I'm Proud Of It.\" Buzzfeed Senior editor Rachel W. Miller retweeted a Cosmo article on anal sex with this classic comment: \"Pretty sure this experience is worse than any cringey butt sex, Cosmo, but ok.\"\n\nAs the perfect conclusion to the night, Huffington Post decided to stop using the controversial tagline it had on Trump stories. \"The Huffington Post's editor's note calling Donald Trump as a 'racist' and 'xenophobe' is no more, a source in the newsroom tells POLITICO.\"\n\n\n\nDan Gainor is the Media Research Center's Vice President for Business and Culture.

One day, the 90-year-old grandmother recalled, she even walked into her living room to find a border crosser trying to evade capture.\n\n\"He had come into my house and was just sitting in my rocking chair watching Border Patrol go by,\" she said. \"It was terrifying.\"\n\nAnother time, drug dealers stashed 30 pounds of marijuana under her bougainvillea bush.\n\nTaylor is not alone. On a recent tour of border towns in south Texas, FoxNews.com spoke with residents like Taylor as well as business owners and local law enforcement about the daily fears people face as they live and work in what amounts to disputed territory.\u00a0\n\nMany describe a deteriorating situation where illegal immigration is on the rise but few can do anything about it for fear of retaliation by cartels, human traffickers and even some authorities.\n\n\"It's hard to know who to trust,\" Taylor said. She added that while she has a \"good rapport\" with local law enforcement on the ground, \"It's the ones who sit in the office \u2026 they don't care about us.\"\n\nSeveral residents FoxNews.com spoke to near the border say they feel forgotten.\n\n\"We live here, we work here and raise our children here but every day we see [border crossers, drug smugglers] and nothing changes,\" said McAllen resident Milo, who asked FoxNews.com not to use his last name out of safety concerns. \"I've seen [drug and human trafficking] scouts on our street with Border Patrol parked down the road. They don't do anything.\"\n\nHe also said he's seen \"SUVs sitting in front of the house\" after reporting suspicious activity.\u00a0\n\nAs President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, vowing a ramp-up in border and immigration enforcement -- and the construction of a controversial U.S.-Mexico border wall -- the outgoing Obama administration has taken some steps to boost enforcement.\u00a0\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection last year dispatched 150 more agents to police the southwestern border.\n\nBut Taylor said her area still is used as a \"funnel\" for people illegally crossing the border.\u00a0\n\nSome paddle across the river while others hide in the field waiting for their \"coyote\" or smuggler to pick them up. Some stroll in through a gigantic gap in the border barrier near her house.\u00a0\n\nTaylor says she always calls the authorities to report criminal activity on her property, including when she found the marijuana stash. But she also said she worries she could be putting herself and her family in danger.\u00a0\n\nIn south Texas, Mexican and South American cartels have been able to infiltrate law enforcement agencies in the U.S. Several former law enforcement officials from an anti-narcotics force in the Rio Grande Valley are currently serving lengthy prison sentences for drug crimes and corruption. \u00a0\n\nIn 2016, Border Patrol agent Joel Luna was charged with capital murder for the March 2015 beheading of an undocumented Honduran immigrant. Luna, a south Texas native and Army combat veteran, allegedly decapitated Palacio Paz and left his headless body floating in the bay. Prosecutors claim Luna was part of a cartel drug trafficking conspiracy with his brothers. Luna has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn November, Border Patrol agent Eduardo Bazen Jr., also was arrested after being accused of working with a drug trafficking organization. According to the criminal complaint, Bazen said he was paid $8,000 for falsifying a 2007 drug bust and admitted to lying about suspects being present at the scene.\n\nThe drug trade \u2013 even more so than human trafficking \u2013 has skyrocketed in recent years along the border.\n\nIn fiscal 2016, nearly 1.3 million pounds of marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines were seized along the southwest border, according to U.S. Border Patrol.\n\nCameron County Sheriff's Office Lt. Robert Rodriguez told FoxNews.com the cartels are constantly reinventing ways to smuggle drugs into the U.S.\n\n\"They change tactics all the time,\" he said, adding that drug runners are now using large makeshift rafts to float trucks, fully loaded with drugs, across the Rio Grande. \"They always seem to be one step ahead.\"\n\nAs for residents living along the border, some have sold their property and moved. For Taylor, that's not an option.\n\n\"Why should I move? I haven't done anything wrong,\" she said.\u00a0\n\nInstead, she locks her doors but leaves food and water out \"for anyone who needs it.\"\n\n\"I always ask 'Are you hungry?\" she said. \"I will feed them but they know I will also be calling Border Patrol.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.21118021011353, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 803, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.02055552463, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170116230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.61519302615193, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/06/free-from-boko-haram-nigeria-chibok-girls-are-kept-silent.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [77]}}, "headline": "Free from Boko Haram, Nigeria's Chibok girls are kept silent", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1237, "date": "20170106120000", "story_content": "LAGOS, Nigeria \u2013 \u00a0She was found wandering in a forest, the first of the nearly 300 Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram to escape on her own and reach freedom. That was in May. Since then, Amina Ali Nkeki has been sequestered by Nigeria's intelligence agency, embraced just once by her family months ago.\n\nSome say Nigeria's government is keeping the young woman silent because it doesn't want her telling the world about military blunders in the fight against the Islamic extremist group, and about her desire to be reunited with the father of her child \u2014 a detained former Boko Haram commander.\n\n\"I worry, sometimes, that I don't know if she is alive or dead,\" her mother, Binta Ali Nkeki, sobbed during an exclusive telephone interview with The Associated Press from her remote northeastern village of Mbalala. She said she hasn't seen her daughter since July.\n\nSunday marks 1,000 days since the mass kidnapping, and most of the Chibok schoolgirls remain in captivity. The few who have been freed, like Amina, have found themselves not completely free.\n\nThe mass abduction horrified the world and brought Boko Haram international attention. The failure of Nigeria's former government to quickly act to free the schoolgirls sparked a global Bring Back Our Girls movement, with even U.S. first lady Michelle Obama posting a photo with the logo on social media.\n\nAmina was the first to escape on her own. Months later, in October, the government negotiated the release of 21 Chibok girls. Another girl was freed in November in an army raid on an extremist camp in the Sambisa Forest. On Thursday, yet another girl was found during military interrogations of Boko Haram suspects, along with her baby.\n\nIn December, when Amina's mother heard that \"freed\" Chibok girls would be allowed to come home for Christmas, she borrowed money for transport to reach the town where the girls were kidnapped from a government boarding school in April 2014.\n\nWhen Binta reached Chibok, she was welcomed by the 21 girls, who tried to reassure her that her daughter was \"fine, in good health,\" even though she had not been allowed to accompany them.\n\nHuman rights groups and lawyers have criticized Nigeria's treatment of the freed girls, who are held in Abuja, the capital, nearly 900 kilometers (560 miles) from Chibok. The government says the girls are getting medical attention, trauma counseling and rehabilitation.\n\nOfficials in the government and the presidency did not respond to requests for comment, following a familiar pattern.\n\nPeople who have spoken to the freed girls say they have stories that the government does not want told, including that three Chibok girls were killed last year in Nigerian Air Force bombings of Boko Haram camps.\n\nAmina has said she wants to be home with her mother, and she has insisted that the father of her child is a victim, like herself, who was kidnapped by Boko Haram and forced to fight for the insurgents.\n\nHer mother says that when her daughter was rescued \u2014 hunters found her, the father of her child and the 4-month-old baby in a forest \u2014 she said she didn't want to go back to school. But her mother and brother, Noah, persuaded her to take up Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari's promise to give her the best education possible.\n\n\"They told her that soon she will be starting school,\" Noah Ali Nkeki told the AP in an interview. He got the news in a rare phone call from his sister on Thursday, the first time he had heard from her in three months.\n\nHe cannot call her. Officials call him using a blocked number and then put his sister on the line. The girl's mother doesn't get to speak to her because she doesn't own a cell phone and reception in her village is poor.\n\n\"I don't know what the government is trying to do. They have had her now for seven months,\" Noah said.\n\nBinta, a gaunt woman whose eyes mirror the pain of a hard life and whose hands are rough from farming, was widowed five years ago. Eleven of her children have died, in childbirth or soon afterward. The only survivors are her son and only daughter.\n\n\"I wonder how my only grandchild is doing,\" she said of Amina's daughter, Safia. \"Do you think she's walking by now?\"\n\nBinta was suicidal after her daughter's kidnapping, community leaders have told the AP, after hearing reports of Boko Haram's threats to sell the kidnapped girls into slavery, marry them off to fighters and force them to convert to Islam. Chibok is a Christian enclave in mainly Muslim northern Nigeria.\n\nBinta rallied after she got a message from Amina in 2015, when Boko Haram attacked Chibok again. Two male fighters accompanied by a girl carrying ammunition came across an elderly woman too feeble to flee. The girl, speaking the Chibok language that the fighters could not understand, asked the woman: \"Do you know who I am? I am Amina. My mother's name is Binta in the village of Mbalala. Please tell her you saw me.\"\n\nThe elderly woman described the encounter to community leaders, who deliberated, worrying that the \"proof of life\" message might be too much for her mother to bear.\n\nThen human rights lawyer Emmanuel Ogede stepped in. \"I suggested that they pass on the message. If I had a daughter who was missing, and she tried to send a message to me, l'd be very upset if someone withheld it. Amina tried to reach out, let's help her complete the effort,\" he counseled.\n\nOgede is upset about the politicization of the freed Chibok girls.\n\nWhen Amina was freed, she and her family were flown to Abuja, where TV cameras and photographers documented Buhari welcoming her at the presidential mansion. That happened again with the 21 freed girls.\n\nThe girls needed trauma counseling and medical care, not exposure to the media, Human Rights Watch said at the time.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the freed girls visiting Chibok did not get to see their parents. They were kept in the house of a local legislator until Borno state Gov. Kashim Shettima arrived to \"present\" them to their parents the next day. Witnesses said the girls were angry that they were kept from going to their homes and to their church's Christmas Day service.\n\nShettima's spokesman, Isa Gusau, denied that version, which came from some of the parents. \"I am not sure they were denied access to their parents because that was the essence of them being taken to Chibok in the first place,\" he told the AP. \"If you say their movements were restricted for security reasons and for their safety, I think that makes sense.\"\n\nYakubu Nkeki, chairman of the Chibok association of parents of the kidnapped girls and who is not related to Amina, said the Department of State Security intelligence agents who accompanied the girls deemed it was unsafe for them to visit parents in outlying villages. But those with homes in Chibok town were not allowed to stay with their parents, either.\n\nAmina's mother, despite her tears, still has some faith in Nigeria's actions.\n\n\"Anything that the government wants to do with Amina, I have no problem with that,\" she said. \"But I just want to see my daughter with my own eyes.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Haruna Umar in Maiduguri, Ibrahim Abdulaziz in Yola and Bashir Adigun in Abuja, Nigeria, contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.23076915740967, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1207, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 14, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.10804491916, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170106120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.89975144987572, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/11/9-surprising-health-benefits-cheese.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e8": [735]}}, "headline": "9 surprising health benefits of cheese", "wordcount_as_scraped": 779, "date": "20161212000000", "story_content": "It's easy to lump in cheese with cake, bread, and other waistline offenders. Not so fast, though: Although some dairy products might pack on pounds, many cheeses are actually good for you in moderation, as part of a balanced diet. (Read: This isn't permission to eat a wedge of cheese for lunch, with a chaser of cheesecake.) Here are a few tasty morsels of information from nutritionist Karen Ansel, R.D.N., coauthor of Healthy in a Hurry: Simple, Wholesome Recipes for Every Meal of the Day; her insights will help you indulge in all the right ways.\n\n1.) Cheese can help you stay slim\n\"Cheese may help you stay slim thanks to a substance called butyrate, found in many cheeses,\" says Ansel. Gruy\u00e8re, blue, and Gouda, Parmesan, and cheddar all have high amounts. \"Research suggests that it may help boost metabolism. These cheeses also encourage the bacteria in our gut to make even more butyrate, so it's a double win.\"\n\n2.) Cheese may help prevent cancer\nThis news is easy to digest: \"One study found that the butyrate in cheese can protect against colon cancer by nourishing the cells of your colon,\" says Ansel, \"and by reducing that inflammation that can damage the colon over time.\"\n\n3.) Cheese is whey good for building muscle\n\"Protein-packed cheese is a smart snack for building muscle,\" Ansel says. Protein is made of amino acids, which are the building blocks of muscle tissue. \"For the best protein boost, try ricotta cheese,\" says Ansel. \"It's one of the single best sources of whey protein, which is especially advantageous for muscle building. And it tastes a lot better than a gritty protein powder.\"\n\n4.) Cheese is good for your bones\nA strong case for Parmesan and cheddar: \"Since it's made from milk, cheese is packed with calcium to help keep your bones strong,\" Ansel says. \"Snacking on just one ounce of Parmesan gives you 336 milligrams of calcium, and the same amount of cheddar offers 216 milligrams.\" That's a good portion of the day's needs: Most adult men require 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily.\n\n5.) Cheese is good for your teeth, too\nChew on this: \"Eating cheese can keep your teeth healthier thanks to calcium and phosphorus,\" Ansel says. \"These two minerals fight the lactic acid that's naturally present in our mouths and prevent it from breaking down tooth enamel.\" You need that enamel to chew food without damage to the teeth, as well as to prevent cavities and erosion.\n\n6.) Cheese could ward off diabetes\nGo on, upgrade from hamburger to cheeseburger. Those same butyrate-dense cheeses may help protect against type 2 diabetes. \"Although research in this area is just starting to emerge, a study in the journal Diabetes found that mice that ate chow containing added butyrate had insulin levels that were 50 percent lower than mice who ate the regular kind. Experts suspect that butyrate may help human bodies use insulin more effectively too, in its managing of blood-sugar levels.\"\n\n7.) Cheese is a healthy complement to your meal\nHere's the skinny: There are many cheeses that are light in both fat and calories that are an excellent addition to your meal. \"If you're trying to cut fat and calories, stick with feta. It's the skinniest cheese around, with only 6 grams of fat and 70 calories per ounce,\" says Ansel. (We like putting it on top of our noontime spinach salads. \"Mozzarella is the next best thing to feta, with only 85 calories and 6 grams of fat per ounce,\" she adds. Pair it with tangy roasted peppers in a salad, or Caprese-style with basil and tomatoes. Ansel's third pick is Swiss cheese: \"It boasts only 106 calories and 8 grams of fat per ounce. Try shredding it into an omelet with asparagus or spinach.\"\n\n8.) Even the lactose-intolerant can eat certain cheeses\nIf lactose does a number on your stomach, you can still eat certain cheeses. \"When natural cheeses including Parmesan, cheddar, Gouda, Swiss, mozzarella, and Brie are made, the manufacturing and aging processes remove almost all of the lactose,\" says Ansel. Try just a bit: \"One ounce of these cheeses contains less than a gram of lactose, compared with the 12 grams you'd get from a glass of milk.\"\n\n9.) It's the best comfort food\u2014 no debate\n\"Everybody needs comfort foods now and then,\" Ansel says. \"So if you're going to reach for one, go for cheese, which has some big nutrition benefits compared with a pile of cookies or chips. But when you do, be sure to stick with a couple of small cubes and not a huge hunk of it. Those calories can add up quickly too.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.8285714387893701, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 745, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 7, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.1474566929099996, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161212000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.28187919463087, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/29/marine-combat-vet-rep-mike-coffman-how-to-end-violence-in-post-isis-iraq.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [208, 722, 1120, 1267, 1373, 1500, 1660, 2188, 2629, 2746, 2906, 3026, 3028, 4228]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 657, "scraper_regex": 703}}, "headline": "Marine combat vet, Rep.

If nothing changes, the Sunni Arab regions will, once again, return to being mired in a vicious cycle of sectarian violence. How to prevent such an outcome is a key question and I believe that unless the Sunni Arab regions of Iraq, once controlled by ISIS, perceive they have a path forward to becoming a full partner in a Shia-dominated government, this area will remain a breeding ground for terrorists.\n\nTo provide some background:\u00a0 Prior to the 2003 U.S. led invasion of Iraq, the Sunni Arabs, at only twenty percent of the population, were the ruling elite of the country and enjoyed a privileged status over the majority Shia Arabs.\n\nUnder Saddam Hussein's dictatorship, an authoritarian rule of the country was accomplished through a vertically integrated structure that placed all power at the central government in Baghdad.\u00a0 Iraqi local and provincial authorities were merely administrative arms of the bureaucrats in Baghdad who dictated the orders from Saddam Hussein.\u00a0\n\nAfter the U.S. led invasion of 2003 toppled Saddam Hussein, an Iraqi constitution was ratified in 2005.\u00a0 Article 5 of the constitution contains a provision that allows provinces to band together to form a semiautonomous region(s).\u00a0 Shortly after the constitution was ratified, the Kurds, under Article 5, formed what is now known as Kurdistan while the Sunni areas have not banded together.\u00a0 Consequently, local and provincial governments in the Sunni areas of Iraq still have no more authority to make decisions than they did when the country was ruled under a dictatorship.\n\nFollowing the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with a common sectarian enemy in the emerging majority Shia government of Iraq, the Sunni Arabs, at first, welcomed al Qaeda, a Sunni terrorist organization, into their communities despite never sharing the same vision for what they wanted to achieve beyond defeating Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces.\u00a0\n\nBy 2005, however, a noticeable split emerged between these two disparate parts of the insurgency because al Qaeda fighters were increasingly seen as outsiders terrorizing the Sunni Arab communities. As the Sunni tribal leaders came to see al Qaeda as an even greater threat than the Shias, they aligned with the U.S. military which armed them, trained them, and then paid these disaffected Sunni tribal militias to fight against al Qaeda.\u00a0 This transformation, often referred to as the \"Sunni Awakening,\" was a turning point in defeating al Qaeda in Iraq.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, in 2011, President Obama, against the advice of the intelligence and defense community, withdrew all remaining U.S. military forces from Iraq.\u00a0 By severing our military-to-military relationships, we also lost our political influence within the Iraqi government. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nImmediately after the U.S. military pulled out of Iraq, Prime Minister Nori Maliki launched a systematic campaign to push the Sunnis Arabs out of the government creating an opening for ISIS, an organization evolved from Al Qaeda and battle-hardened in Syria, to spill over into Iraq and rapidly take control all of the Sunni-dominated regions who had no loyalty to the Iraqi government in Baghdad.\n\nAssuming the current offensive will expel ISIS from Iraq, I urge the incoming Trump administration to encourage the Sunnis to form, and the Iraqi government to accept, a semi-autonomous region, a \"Sunnistan,\" similar to Kurdistan. Doing so could go a long way toward creating the conditions where the Sunnis feel they have more say in governing themselves at the local and provincial levels. This could help bring stability to the country, reduce sectarian violence, and to prevent the Sunni Arab areas from, once again, becoming a safe haven for radical Islamic terrorists.\n\nThis solution is not perfect and it still requires an equitable distribution of the oil wealth of the country. A semi-autonomous region, however, can provide the Sunni Arabs with the non-violent political voice they need. \u00a0\n\n\n\nU.S. Representative Mike Coffman is a member of the House Armed Services Committee.

Although elections are not scheduled until 2019, few Israeli governments last for their full terms.\n\nIn an interview at his office in the Knesset, Lapid attributed his recent success to hard work by his party's lawmakers and the appeal of a moderate party in a country that has been pushed to extremes.\n\n\"The concept of a center party, of people who are pragmatic and moderate and look for solutions, instead of sticking to extreme ideologies, is more and more appealing, at least in this country,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu presides over a hard-line coalition that is dominated by nationalist allies of the West Bank settler movement. Now in his third consecutive term, Netanyahu remains in control as long as key partners maintain the coalition.\n\nBut he and his allies are under tremendous pressure from powerful groups in Israel that bitterly oppose the government \u2014 sustaining a siege atmosphere and sense of constant peril in government circles. Many among the security establishment, academia, the cultural community and media have been at loggerheads with Netanyahu for years.\n\nAmong the contentious issues are policies that appear to be aimed at stifling dovish critics. Peace efforts with the Palestinians have been frozen for years, while settlement construction in occupied territories has steamed ahead \u2014 leading to repeated run-ins with the United States and other key allies.\n\nAt home, Netanyahu is heading into a stormy winter parliamentary session that will tackle a series of issues that each could threaten his coalition from within. The government faces a court-ordered Dec. 25 deadline to evacuate an illegal West Bank outpost \u2014 over the objections of key coalition partners \u2014 and a state watchdog agency is set to issue a potentially damaging report on the government's handling of a 2014 war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nBut the most galvanizing issue for Netanyahu's rivals is the sense that the country's liberal democracy is under assault. An example of that is Netanyahu's contentious plan to reform the state-run broadcast authority that critics say is aimed at increasing his control of local media.\n\n\"I think we have ahead of us in this Knesset session a very heated dispute about the word Israeli, where the country is going to, in all fields of living, from the relationship with the international community, with the Jewish world, economy security, so on so forth,\" Lapid said. He declined to criticize Netanyahu, saying it was inappropriate to do so in an interview with foreign media.\n\nA former author, columnist, news anchor and bank pitchman, Lapid burst onto the political scene in 2013, leading his newfound Yesh Atid to a surprisingly strong showing in parliamentary elections that year. Promising relief for Israel's struggling middle class, as well as an end to draft exemptions for religious seminary students, Yesh Atid finished as the second-largest party, with 19 seats in the 120-member parliament.\n\nLapid, known for his wide grin and black attire, took on the job of finance minister, a difficult and often thankless task.\n\nWhile marking some successes, such as raising payments to Holocaust survivors, his key promises of lowering the cost of living and bringing down housing prices failed to materialize. He ultimately was fired by Netanyahu for insubordination.\n\nIn last year's election, Yesh Atid dropped to just 11 seats and Lapid found himself in the opposition. It appeared set to become the latest in a string of centrist parties to enjoy early success and quickly flame out.\n\nBut Lapid has proven wilier, using his time in the opposition to reinvent himself. Once seen as an unofficial spokesman for the country's secular middle class, he has toned down his attacks on the country's ultra-Orthodox community and even embraced some religious rituals. Appealing to Netanyahu's base, he has joined the prime minister in bashing the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO for passing resolutions seen as anti-Israeli. He also has joined the prime minister in condemning dovish Israeli human rights groups that criticize Israeli policies to overseas audiences.\n\nHis tactics have drawn criticism that Lapid is becoming a mild-mannered version of Netanyahu \u2014 a charge he rejects. But recent polls have shown Yesh Atid winning as many as 27 seats if elections were held today, with at least some of those seats apparently siphoned off from Likud.\n\nSkepticism certainly remains about Lapid's chances against Netanyahu. Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at Hebrew University, said Lapid is benefiting from a protest instinct in the polls, \"but between this and actually taking on Netanyahu, this is going to be a different world.\"\n\nLapid said that while he and Netanyahu are both \"patriots\" who believe in Israel as a \"just cause,\" there are key differences, especially regarding Mideast peace and strengthening relations with the international community.\n\nLapid said that Israel must find a way to separate from the Palestinians, as soon as possible, with the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. With continued Israeli control over millions of Palestinians who do not have voting rights, \"we will either lose the Jewish majority or the democratic nature of Israel or both, and I'm not willing for this to happen,\" he said.

The group said in a statement that a suicide bomber attacked the shrine with the intent of killing Shiite Muslims and issued a picture of the attacker.\n\nWhen IS circulated a photograph of one of the attackers in last month's deadly assault on a police academy in southwestern Baluchistan province, two Taliban officials told The Associated Press that the attacker was an Uzbek, most likely a member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. More than 60 people, most of them police recruits, were killed in that Oct. 26 attack when three assailants battled security forces for hours before being killed or detonating their suicide vests.\n\nThe Taliban officials, both of whom are familiar with the IMU, spoke on condition of anonymity because their leadership has banned them from talking to the media.\n\nAuthorities initially said the police academy attack was orchestrated by militants hiding out in Afghanistan and blamed Pakistan's virulently anti-Shiite group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. But IS later claimed responsibility and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi spokesman Ali Bin Sufyan said they partnered with IS to carry out the assault.\n\nIn Afghanistan and Pakistan, the extremist group has adopted the name the Islamic State in Khorasan \u2014 a reference to an ancient geographical region that encompassed a vast swath of territory stretching from Turkmenistan through Iran and Afghanistan.\n\nIS in Khorasan has set up its base in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province, and while it has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, it remains unclear whether there are direct operational or financial links between the two.\n\nAccording to police, Afghan officials and IS media outlets, the majority of Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan are Pakistani nationals, mostly from the tribal regions. Disgruntled Taliban fighters from Pakistan and Afghanistan have joined along with foreign fighters, mainly from central Asia. The group's leader until his death in July in a drone strike was Hafiz Saeed Khan, a former Pakistani Taliban commander. IS has never acknowledged Khan's death, which was confirmed by both the Afghan and U.S. militaries.\n\nCounterterrorism officials in Pakistan say that IS has begun reaching out to local militants through its rich social media presence.\n\n\"They are inspiring the like-minded youth in Pakistan through their strong social media propaganda,\" said Junaid Sheikh, a senior counterterrorism commander in the southern city of Karachi.\n\n\"There is evidence that militants of other organizations like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Al-Qaeda in the Subcontinent and other Sunni extremist organizations switched their ideology toward Daesh and acted like their activists,\" he said, using an Arabic acronym for IS. The recruitment of Uzbek militants is particularly worrisome and a \"significant threat to our national security,\" he added.\n\nHe said Uzbek fighters have carried out numerous major attacks in Pakistan, including a 2011 attack on a naval base and a 2014 attack on the Karachi Airport. Local militant groups provided the intelligence to carry out the attacks, he said.\n\nA resident of Afghanistan's Nangarhar province who did not want to be identified for fear of retribution said he spoke with two Iranian Islamic State members late last year. Unlike the Pakistani and Afghan insurgents, the resident, who fled to Pakistan after his home was overrun by IS fighters, said the foreign fighters were friendly and engaged with local residents. One Iranian fighter said he was recruited for his computer skills, the resident said.\n\nPreviously, Uzbek insurgents normally allied with the Pakistani and Afghan branches of the Taliban, having sworn allegiance to Taliban founder Mullah Mohammed Omar. However, many Uzbek fighters split from the Taliban and declared allegiance to IS last year after it was revealed that Taliban officials had hidden the fact that Mullah Omar had died two years earlier.\n\nA senior police official in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province, where several militant groups are headquartered, said the IS group is firmly entrenched in Pakistan and its roots are growing stronger as it aligns with Pakistan's Sunni Muslim extremist groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. The police official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The official also said that Lashkar-e-Jhangvi had largely relocated from Punjab to Baluchistan province in the face of a major military campaign.\n\n\"Pakistani Taliban factions that have sparred with the parent Pakistani Taliban have tended to express public support for ISIS,\" said Michael Kugelman, senior associate for South Asia at the U.S.-based Wilson Center. \"I could certainly envision collusions materializing between disaffected Pakistani Taliban fighters now aligned with ISIS, and Uzbek militants with preexisting ties to the Pakistani Taliban. Either way, at the end of the day, all of these terrorists are cut from the same cloth ideologically and so we should never rule out operational partnerships.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Abdul Sattar in Quetta, Pakistan, Adil Jawad in Karachi, Pakistan and Ishtiaq Mahsud in Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.2805280685424805, "HarmVice": 27, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 830, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 7.86665732829, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 27, "mft_sum": 49, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161113070000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.45454545455, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.9036144578313205, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/12/05/even-with-one-cigarette-day-odds-early-death-are-higher.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Even with one cigarette a day, odds of early death are higher", "wordcount_as_scraped": 566, "date": "20161205210000", "story_content": "Smokers who go through much less than a pack of cigarettes a day still have a higher risk of an early death than non-smokers, a new study suggests.\n\n\"There is no safe level of cigarette smoking,\" said lead study author Maki Inoue-Choi, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute in Rockville, Maryland.\n\n\"Even smokers who consistently smoked less than one cigarette per day were more likely to die in our study than never smokers,\" Inoue-Choi said by email.\n\nTobacco smoking poses a major public health challenge and claims about five million lives each year worldwide, researchers note in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nA growing number of smokers tend to be \"light\" smokers, going through less than half a pack of cigarettes a day, the authors write. This used to be how people cut back gradually on the path to quitting, but it's increasingly a pattern that smokers follow for years at a time.\n\nTo get a better picture of the health effects of light smoking, researchers tracked more than 290,000 adults aged 59 to 82, including more than 22,000 current smokers and more than 156,000 former smokers, who completed surveys in 2004 and 2005.\n\nBy 2011, compared to people who never smoked, adults who consistently smoked at least part of one cigarette a day were 64 percent more likely to have died of any cause, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nSmoking one to 10 cigarettes a day was associated with 87 percent higher odds of dying from all causes during the study than not smoking at all.\n\nLung cancer deaths in particular were much more likely among light smokers than non-smokers. The odds of death from lung cancer were more than nine times higher with a habit of even one cigarette a day, while smoking up to 10 cigarettes a day was associated with almost 12 times the risk of death from lung cancer.\n\nFormer smokers fared better when they quit at younger ages. For example, ex-smokers of one to 10 cigarettes a day who kicked the habit after age 50 had a 42 percent higher risk of death from all causes during the study period, compared to those who kicked the habit at younger ages. One limitation of the study is that researchers relied on participants to accurately recall and report on how often they smoked even may years in the past, the authors note.\n\nEven so, the findings should reinforce that even light smokers can face serious health risks from the habit, the authors note.\n\n\"The take home message is that all smokers should stop smoking, even if they smoke only occasionally, or if they smoke very few cigarettes a day,\" Jean-Francois Etter, a researcher at the University of Geneva in Switzerland who wasn't involved in the study, said in an email.\n\nThe study also showed very little benefit from cutting back from two packs a day to half a pack a day, said Judith Prochaska, a researcher at Stanford University in California who wasn't involved in the study.\n\n\"Low intensity smokers often downplay their use of tobacco - may even identify as nonsmokers - and may rationalize their behavior as low risk,\" Prochaska said by email.\n\n\"The findings ought to compel physicians to intervene with patients who report any level of current tobacco use,\" Prochaska added. \"As a motivating message, the sooner individuals quit smoking, the greater the health benefits in extending years of life.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.8145694732666002, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 560, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.15708382376, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 6, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.07142857142857, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.545454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/14/indonesia-miss-transgender-crowned-in-slap-for-hard-liners.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [81]}}, "headline": "Indonesia Miss Transgender crowned in a slap for hard-liners", "wordcount_as_scraped": 729, "date": "20161114090000", "story_content": "JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2013 \u00a0Transgender people and gay activists from across Indonesia have defied a wave of hatred against sexual minorities to crown a Miss Transgender at a national pageant held in absolute secrecy.\n\nA handful of journalists were notified just a few hours in advance of the location of the event, held in the capital, Jakarta, to prevent any attempts by Islamic hard-liners to shut down the pageant. And because of the risk of discovery and violence, organizers asked those present not to post anything on social media during the contest.\n\nQienabh Tappii, a 28-year-old representing Jakarta who wore a figure-hugging, iridescent metallic gown, triumphed over more than 30 other contestants Friday night to be crowned Miss Waria Indonesia 2016. She will represent Indonesia at an international pageant to be held in Thailand next year. \"Waria\" is the Indonesian word for transgender, a term for people whose sense of their gender is different from their sex at birth.\n\n\"I'm very happy, I feel like I want to cry,\" said Tappii, standing next to a 2-meter (6.5-foot) -tall gold and red trophy while cradling a smaller one.\n\n\"Tonight is the beginning of my struggle for my rights as a waria,\" she said. \"I want waria to be accepted, appreciated and understood in our society, and to be equal with other Indonesians. I will work really hard to achieve it.\"\n\nThe successful staging of the pageant was an important morale boost and self-affirmation for a community that is increasingly under siege.\n\nIndonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, is often held up as practicing a moderate form of Islam. But that reputation for tolerance has been undermined in the past year as the media and religious and political leaders stoked prejudice against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, framing them as a threat to the nation.\n\nIt was in part a backlash against the worldwide advance of LGBT rights, and in particular the success of the gay marriage movement in the U.S. and the high-profile battles there over whether transgender people can use the public bathrooms of the gender they identify with.\n\nIndonesia's conservatives want to push LGBT people back into the margins of society and deny them legal rights. It's an agenda that has capitalized on low levels of awareness in a society where open discussion of sexuality is often frowned upon. But it also clashes with the traditions of some cultures in ethnically diverse Indonesia that have for centuries allowed space for different genders and sexual identities.\n\n\"If the public knew in advance that there will be such an event, those who use religion as their mask could attack us. That's why we kept it secret until the last minute,\" said pageant organizer Nancy Iskandar.\n\n\"The radicals are very arrogant. I'm afraid that it could erupt into physical confrontation,\" Iskandar said. \"We don't want them to step on us forever. What's in it for them anyway? We're not doing any harm.\"\n\nOpposition from hard-liners prevented the long-running event, which is organized by Putri Waria Indonesia Foundation and Indonesian Waria Communication Forum, from being held twice in recent years.\n\nIndonesia's police often side with or look the other way when Islamic hard-liners attack or intimidate LGBT groups, religious minorities, women's rights groups and any cultural events they take exception to.\n\nFitri Pabentengi, a member of the Bugis ethic group, which recognizes five genders, said he traveled from Makassar on Sulawesi island \u2014 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) to the east \u2014 for the pageant. In his community he is \"bissu,\" one of the five genders, which roughly corresponds to androgynous. Bissu are traditionally priests or shamans.\n\n\"I came all the way from Makassar to show my solidarity,\" said Pabentengi. \"We Indonesian waria have the same feelings, what they feel in Jakarta we also feel it in Makassar.\"\n\nAbout 200 people filled the small theater for the finale of the high-energy showcase of idealized feminine beauty. Thirty-four transgender women vied for the title, competing over three days, though four dropped out because they feared the event might be disrupted.\n\nAside from Miss Transgender, there were a slew of other titles up for grabs, including most sexy, most intelligent and most beautiful skin.\n\n\"We want to show that waria can also do positive things,\" said Miss West Java, Dinda Syariff.\n\n\"People said that we are the scum of the society \u2014 that's so not true,\" Syariff said.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.379746824502945, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 712, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.5519397904799996, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161114090000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.37078651685393, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/20/children-among-dozens-killed-in-latest-aleppo-attacks.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1953, 2143, 2267]}}, "headline": "Children among hundreds killed in latest Aleppo attacks", "wordcount_as_scraped": 593, "date": "20161120180000", "story_content": "At least eight children were killed Sunday in Syria when rockets struck a school in Aleppo, in a sixth straight day of airstrikes that included a barrel bomb that killed a family of six, Reuters reported.\n\nA teacher was among the dead, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe shelling killed at least eight children among 10 deaths in the Saria Hasoun School, bringing the death toll to about 300 since Tuesday, the start of one of the heaviest bombardments in the country's six-year civil war.\n\nMedics cited by Reuters said the al-Baytounji family had suffocated to death because of the barrel bomb, which fell at about midnight and reportedly was laced with chlorine gas.\n\nThe two medics identified the family in a film that was released online.

Lagarde, 60, faces up to a year in prison and a 15,000-euro ($16,000) fine if convicted of negligence. The judges are expected to return a verdict in the wake of the last hearing but they can also announce a ruling at a later date.\n\nLagarde's upcoming trial and possible conviction may raise concern about her ability to remain IMF boss. The Washington-based institution's credibility was already shaken when her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, also a French citizen, was forced to resign amid sexual assault allegations in 2011.\n\nThe IMF's board has so far supported Lagarde at all stages of the French legal proceedings, which began the month after her appointment in July 2011.\n\nLagarde, the first woman to become finance minister of a Group of Eight country and to be appointed IMF chief, is being tried for her role in a 2008 arbitration ruling that handed 403 million euros ($425 million) to a French business magnate, Bernard Tapie, an ally of then-President Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nTapie, a flamboyant tycoon and former TV star, had sued French bank Credit Lyonnais for its handling of the sale of his majority stake in sportswear company Adidas in the mid-1990s.\n\nWhen Lagarde became finance minister in 2007, the lengthy legal battle between Tapie and the public bank was still unresolved, and she ordered to settle it through an unusual private arbitration panel, instead of regular courts, against the advice of her own services.\n\nThe choice of arbitration proved disastrous for the state by leading to the massive payout to Tapie from public funds. The amount of the award prompted indignation in France.\n\nInvestigating judges say Lagarde committed a series of serious errors when she made the arbitration choice and also, later on, when she refused to challenge the deal, suggesting she may have been influenced by the political connections between Tapie and Sarkozy, according to court documents.\n\n\"Ms. Lagarde's behavior proceeds not only from a questionable carelessness and precipitation, but also from a conjunction of faults which, by their nature, number and seriousness, exceed the level of mere negligence,\" the judges wrote at the end of their investigation.\n\nSoon after the arbitration deal was notified, investigators suspected that the whole process was rigged in favor of the magnate.\n\nIn 2013, Tapie, his lawyer, one of the arbitrators and Lagarde's chief of staff at the ministry, Stephane Richard, now the CEO of the telecom company Orange, were charged with gang-related fraud, and Lagarde's Paris home was searched by police. Tapie later got another charge of misappropriation of funds. In 2015, a court quashed the arbitration deal, and then ordered Tapie to pay the money back. Last June, the top French court ruled the arbitration was fraudulent.\n\nOn Monday, Lagarde is due to appear in the Court of Justice of the Republic, a special body that tries government ministers for alleged wrongdoing while in office. The court is made up of three professional magistrates from the highest French court, including its president, and 12 members of Parliament, from opposition and majority parties.\n\nOne of Lagarde's lawyers, Patrick Maisonneuve, has argued his client can't be tried until criminal courts have ruled in the cases of Tapie and other suspects. He reportedly said he will ask the court on Monday to postpone the trial on those grounds.\n\nChristopher Mesnooh, legal analyst and lawyer with the Paris, New York and Washington bars, said the whole Tapie case is \"highly political\" and that French citizens have a \"strong feeling about it\" because \"there is a question of public money involved.\"\n\n\"(Lagarde) had a high government position when the decision was made to pursue the arbitration and then not to appeal the award,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\n___\n\nAlex Turnbull contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.77489757537842, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 652, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.2305171175200003, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161211180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.45398773006135, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/11/22/tijuana-braces-for-huge-influx-deportees-some-15k-per-month-under-trump/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [2669], "\u00a0": [94, 3162, 5456]}}, "headline": "Tijuana braces for huge influx of deportees, some 15K per month, under Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 891, "date": "20161122190000", "story_content": "Tijuana, Mexico \u2013 \u00a0Since Donald Trump's promise to \"immediately deport two to three million undocumented immigrants,\" the Mexican city of Tijuana has been preparing to bear the brunt of an immigration exodus on a scale never before seen in the country.\n\nNicknamed Mexico's \"deportee capital,\" Tijuana has received 40 percent of all U.S. deportations since 2010 \u2013 an average of 7,500 a month \u2013 and officials say they are expecting this number to double under a Trump presidency.\n\n\"We are expecting U.S. deportations to Tijuana to grow to 150,000 annually in the next two years,\" Rosario Lozada, the head of Tijuana's Migrant Attention program, told Fox News Latino. \"We are concerned by the situation, because we struggle to cope with the volume of deportees we currently receive.\"\n\nLozada heads up a local government program that seeks to help deportees rebuild their lives following ejection from the United States. Rosario and her team offer counseling and temporary accommodation, with the final goal of encouraging deportees to leave Tijuana, an aim she says has become more difficult in recent years.\n\n\"We always encourage deportees to leave the border, but those who remain usually have no connection to Mexico, with their lives and family in the United States,\" she said. \"Proximity to loved ones and the hope of re-crossing will keep people here, despite the dangers of life on the border.\"\n\nMass deportations like those Trump has proposed would be disastrous for Tijuana, Lozada says.\n\n\"We struggle to cope with the volume of deportees at the moment,\" she said. \"There is no funding to move deportees on, temporary accommodation is already past capacity and local organized crime preys upon the vulnerability of the deportees.\"\n\n\"The arrival of hundreds of thousands of undocumented people in the space of a few months would plunge Tijuana into chaos,\" she told FNL.\n\nWhen asked about Trump's plans for a border wall, Lozada less worried.\n\n\"Tijuana already has three layers of fence and buffer zones between Mexico and the United States,\" she noted. \"Our main concern is the volume people coming back the other way.\"\n\nOf the 100,000 deportees who are ejected across California's San Isidro border sector annually, an average of 26 percent choose to remain in Tijuana.\n\nLarge slums, dominated by drug cartels, have sprung up along the border line in and around the city. Today, neighborhoods like Zona Norte have become no-go zones even for locals.\n\n\"Things have been so bad here at times that I've wanted to go and punch a cop, just to get put in prison and taken away from here,\" Rub\u00e9n Robles, a deported U.S. army veteran who now lives 50 yards from the border fence, told Fox News Latino.\n\n\"There's a huge divide between locals and deportees here,\" said Julio Lujano, who was deported last year from San Jose, California, and remains in Tijuana in the hope of re-crossing. \"The Chicano deportees are looked down upon in a lot of places.\"\n\nEdward Haase is a San Diego-based deportation defense lawyer, and he says that the legal community is very curious to see what Trump's \u00a0immigration policy actually looks like.\n\n\"I would say that the deportation of three million immigrants is an impossible task,\" he told FNL. \"Firstly, I don't know where he's getting the numbers. We have no evidence that there are so many 'criminal aliens' in the country, to use his term.\"\n\n\"How will you judge what constitutes a bad enough crime to warrant deportation? To where exactly will you deport these people? Who will cover the costly legal battles that will inevitably arise? What if a deportation candidate has been here for ten years, has three U.S.-citizen children, and pays taxes?\"\n\n\"These are all issues that Trump hasn't addressed.\"\n\nDespite Haase's practical doubts over Trump's positions, he says he has seen a climate of fear develop in immigrant communities since the election.\n\n\"With Trump, it's impossible to predict what will happen, and that uncertainty has left people scared,\" he told FNL.\n\nTijuana has a number of charities that seek to help the deportee population. Father Pat Murphy of the city's Casa del Migrante (\"Migrant Shelter\") says that increased ejections from the U.S. in recent years has forced the group to change its charity model.\n\n\"In the last eight or nine years we have shifted from being a casa for migrants to a casa for deported people,\" he said at the charity house, a 120-capacity shelter which already struggles to handle the increased volume of daily arrivals.\n\n\"Deportations have increased significantly in the past decade, and that doesn't look like changing with Donald Trump in the White House,\" he said. \"We have to look at the bigger picture, and that is the fact that deportations have been on the rise for the past decade. This isn't the result of a recent political movement.\"\n\nOriginally from Kansas City, Father Murphy believes deportation has a negative effect on the United States in the long term.\n\n\"The vast majority of deportees are FNL. \"I can only imagine that in the coming years we're going to bear the brunt of the effects these kids have [experienced] because dad left them.\"\n\nPeople who advocate for large-scale deportation, he argued, \"are leaving out the human factor ...

The Age ID app, developed by Intellicheck, promises accuracy and quick verification.\n\nThe app uses a phone or tablet's camera to scan the barcode on the back of an ID such as a driver's license.\u00a0 In less than ten seconds, the app verifies the authenticity of an ID and identifies if it's real, fake or needs a second look.\n\nRussell Hanna, the chief of enforcement for Mississippi Alcoholic Beverage Control, says his agency started using the app during the summer of 2016.\u00a0\u00a0Hanna explains authentic info from a real license barcode is often replicated and used on countless fake IDs but while\u00a0the information on the front of the license may look legitimate, the barcode is difficult to re-create and contains information that does not match up.\n\nAccording to Hanna, most young people purchase fake ID's online, including some from China. He says the quality of today's fakes are so convincing his agents often spent nearly ten minutes calling and verifying each ID.\n\nCES 2017: WHAT TO EXPECT\n\nAccording to a study published by the National Institutes of Health, just over 12 percent of college freshmen from a large Midwestern university reported owning a fake ID for the purpose of obtaining alcohol. That number grew to over 30 percent at the end of sophomore year for the same class.\u00a0\n\nBusinesses have been using the app for a little over a year.\u00a0The primary idea behind the technology is to keep age restricted products out of the hands of those who cannot legally buy them, but with\u00a0a variety of licenses from all over the United States it is hard to keep up with changes.\u00a0Victor Pittman, president of Silver Leaf Wines and Spirits in Ridgeland, Miss.,\u00a0 told FoxNews.com.\n\n\"If they change a format or some positioning in their drivers licenses there's no way for us to know,\" he said.\u00a0\n\nThe technology shows promise but it's not 100 percent perfect.\n\nAFTER HER HUSBAND WENT MISSING, AN APP LED HER TO HIS BODY\n\n\"We've had a few, very very limited number, that it said was good and they were not,\" Hanna said. \"We found out they were not good by some other means,\" Hanna said.\u00a0\n\nIntellicheck works with DMVs around the country to identify newly developed fake IDs.\u00a0\n\n\"We re-do our software to catch the new points of quality that they put in to make that almost indistinguishable from an authentic license,\" Roof added. \u00a0\n\nThe developers of the app say that the company adheres to FBI security guidelines since the technology involves personal data.\u00a0 Intellicheck also added that it does not keep any personal info, however businesses may keep information if they decide to ban a person from their establishment.\u00a0\n\nUBER ALLEGEDLY SPIED ON USERS, INCLUDING CELEBRITIES LIKE BEYONCE\n\nThe app isn't something anyone can download from the App Store. William Roof, CEO and president of Intellicheck, says there's a process in place to make sure businesses and law enforcement gain access.\n\n\"We'll vet you and make sure you're an authentic business,\" Roof said. \"Then you download the app and it's a monthly subscription fee [with] unlimited scans.\"\n\nThe app can be downloaded through Apple's Business to Business (B2B) app store and an Android app is currently being developed. \u00a0\n\nSo far, hundreds of businesses are currently using the app and North Carolina's alcohol enforcement agency has adopted its use as well. The app could soon be used by over a dozen different state law enforcement agencies who are currently exploring its use.\n\nThe same technology behind Age ID is also used to prevent fraud in the retail industry and safeguard the country's ports and military bases. A similar app called Defense ID is used to safeguard 23 army installations and 16 U.S. ports and\u00a0high-end retailers such as Helzberg Diamonds use the Retail ID app to prevent fraudulent purchases and returns, according to Initellicheck. The technology could potentially help improve a retailer's bottom line.\u00a0 Data compiled by the National Retail Federation states return fraud and abuse was between $9.1 and $15.9 billion for 2015.\u00a0There are also potential Homeland Security uses in the future.\n\n\n\nWillie James Inman is a Fox News multimedia reporter based in Jackson, Mississippi.

No one is certain how hard he will press for deportation once he becomes president.\n\nTrump's immigration platform was a cornerstone of his campaign. He said he would eliminate DACA and take a harder line on deporting individuals.\n\nBut how that will pan out remains to be seen. Immigrant rights groups and affected communities wait with baited breath. Some are bracing for a fight.\n\n\"For me there are concerns and alarm but we are ready to fight,\" said Cesar Vargas, a DACA recipient who also worked on the Bernie Sanders campaign and was in Arizona monitoring polls on Nov. 8.\u00a0\n\nHe said they are planning forums to begin educating people on their rights as DACA recipients. \"Some people are very, very afraid. We are telling people to stay firm, stay committed.

Some say Dreamers should take priority over other undocumented immigrants because they are in the country illegally through no fault of their own. But, some say, laws protecting them should be passed through Congress \u2014 not through executive action.\n\n\"The idea for amnesty for illegals who came as young children, there's something to that,\" Mark Krikorian, executive director for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors restrictionist immigration policies. \"But it's not something we should do without coupling it with enforcement methods.\n\nDaniel Garza, executive director of the Libre Initiative, a conservative group, said Dreamers should be a legislative priority.\n\n\"I worry a lot about the DACA kids, we need to protect them,\" Garza said. \"They're vulnerable.

In the University of Connecticut in Storrs, they called on their university to make a public statement in support of students who are at risk of deportation and various groups of color.\u00a0\n\nAmbar Pinto, who manages a deportation hotline for the advocacy group United We Dream said she could be undocumented in May, when her DACA application expires.\n\n\"I feel like we're going to try and protect our community but [the threat is] real,\" Pinto said. \"We can go back to being undocumented and go back to being fearful of being deported.\"\n\n\n\nSoni Sangha is a freelance writer based in New York City.\n\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter& Instagram", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.33333325386047, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 550, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.67526163083, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 8, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161111140000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.90909090909091, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/01/18/dont-fall-for-this-sophisticated-gmail-phishing-scam.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [902]}}, "headline": "Don't fall for this sophisticated Gmail phishing scam", "wordcount_as_scraped": 550, "date": "20170118180000", "story_content": "Heads up, Gmail users: a new phishing attack is making the rounds and it's fooling even technically-savvy, security-conscious users.\n\nThe ruse aims to steal usernames and passwords for Gmail and other services, and \"is being used right now with a high success rate,\" according to Mark Maunder, CEO of WordPress security plugin Wordfence, who described the campaign in detail. Like other phishing attacks, this one starts with an email. Instead of a random person, the email may appear to have been sent by someone you know, and it may include an image of an attachment you recognize from the sender.\n\n\"You click on the image, expecting Gmail to give you a preview of the attachment. Instead, a new tab opens up and you are prompted by Gmail to sign in again.

Users can also activate two-step verification for additional account protection,\" Aaron Stein from Google Communications told Maunder.\n\nOnce the attacker gains access to your account, they immediately log in and find one of your actual attachments, plus one of your actual subject lines, and send it to people on your contact list to further the scam and compromise more accounts. Maunder said the attackers have either automated the scheme, or they have \"a team standing by to process accounts as they are compromised.\"\n\n\"Once they have access to your account, the attacker also has full access to all your emails including sent and received at this point and may download the whole lot,\" he warned. \"Now that they control your email address, they could also compromise a wide variety of other services that you use by using the password reset mechanism.\"\n\nMaunder said some have said the attack can even bypass two-factor authentication, though he has not been able to confirm this claim. As Google notes in its statement, it's still a good idea to have two-factor authentication enabled, as it makes your account much harder to crack. Click here for information on how to do that.\n\nTo protect yourself against this attack, Maunder said you will need to pay close attention to your browser's location bar when you're signing into Gmail. The location bar should read \"https://accounts.google.com\u2026.\" and if you see this and only this, you should be good to go. In this attack, the address in the location bar will include \"data:text/html,\" before the usual \"https://accounts.google.com\u2026.\".\n\nMaunder noted that \"there is no sure way to check if your account has been compromised\" by this attack.

The 24-year-old walked away from her family two years ago to join one of the world's longest-raging Marxist rebellions.\n\nMostly in their 20s and 30s, a few dozen New People's Army guerrillas lugged M16 rifles and grenade launchers on a plateau where red hammer-and-sickle flags adorned a makeshift hall. Most wore mud-stained boots while cooking over wood fires or guarding the peripheries of the encampment, just 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from the nearest army camp.\n\nThey're part of a new generation of Maoist fighters who reflect the resiliency and constraints of an insurgency that has dragged on for nearly half a century through six Philippine presidencies while Cold War-era communist insurgencies across much of the world have faded into memory. They are driven by some of the same things as their predecessors, including crushing poverty, despair, government misrule and the abysmal inequality that has long plagued Philippine society.\n\n\"The New People's Army has no other recruiter but the state itself,\" a young rebel, Comrade May, told The Associated Press.\n\nShe joined the rebellion two years ago after her fiance died of kidney failure because his family was too poor to afford the expensive dialysis treatment. A lowly paid factory worker, May couldn't do anything. Government hospitals overwhelmed by swarms of indigent patients failed to give him immediate care.\n\n\"His family gave up and reserved the remaining money for his coffin,\" said May, who now serves as a rebel medic for fellow guerrillas and destitute villagers beyond the government's reach.\n\nKatryn came from a middle-class family that could afford a car, a house and education. She wanted to become a journalist, but got profoundly disaffected by a government and laws she said could not protect the working class, including her father, who lost his job as an engineer for joining a trade union.\n\nShe said she went underground as a left-wing activist and bid goodbye to her father, her mother, who was a former teacher, and a life of modest comforts. \"It was difficult. I cried,\" she said.\n\nNow adjusted to rebel life, Katryn said she'll stay for good. She agreed to face news cameras with just a dash of red and blue paint \u2014 the colors of the revolution \u2014 to camouflage her identity.\n\nThe rebellion's longevity is best personified by Jaime Padilla, or Comrade Diego, who was introduced as the new rebel commander and spokesman in a region that has seen the ebb and flow of the insurgency. Now 69, he took up arms when then-dictator Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972, largely to quell the spreading communist insurrection that began four years earlier.\n\nDonning a newly designed ceremonial khaki uniform topped by a Mao cap, the folksy rebel leader with a ready smile gave an upbeat assessment of the rebellion. The military, however, says it has largely beaten back the guerrillas in most of the provinces south of Manila where Padilla's rebel forces have had a presence.\n\nBattle setbacks, surrenders and infighting have weakened the rebel group, which is blacklisted as a terrorist organization by the United States. A confidential Philippine government assessment obtained by the AP says the guerrillas had declined to 3,800 fighters with more than 4,500 firearms in the first half of the year, with about 700 of the country's 42,000 villages affected by the insurgency.\n\nThe insurgent group \"remains as a threat to national security due to its stance of not abandoning the armed struggle,\" the report said.\n\n\"It's true that the armed struggle has gone through ups and downs, that's a part of history,\" Padilla told the AP. But he added that the rebellion \"will not disappear because of the fundamental needs of the people. The problems have persisted, and that's the platform of the rebellion.\"\n\nFounded in 1968, the rebels' communist party has held peace talks with six Philippine presidents, including Rodrigo Duterte, whose rise to power in June sparked rebel optimism due to his searing anti-U.S. rhetoric, populist pro-poor stance and appointments of at least two left-wing Cabinet members. Both sides declared separate and indefinite cease-fires in August.\n\nBut the guerrillas found themselves in a dilemma after Duterte was accused of gross human rights violations for his anti-drug crackdown, which has left a large number of poor suspected drug users and dealers dead. Some of the slain suspects were rebel followers who were never involved in drugs, Padilla said.\n\nDuterte's recent decision to allow Marcos' burial at a heroes' cemetery, his walking back on his angry threats to scale down Philippine engagements with the U.S. military and rebel allegations of military violations of its own cease-fire have dampened the optimism.\n\nAbout a month ago, Padilla's rebel command offered to provide security to Duterte, calling him a patriot and suspecting that American forces may covertly take steps to kill or oust him over his anti-U.S. stance.\n\nAfter Marcos' burial at the heroes' cemetery, the communist party denounced Duterte for showing \"gross disrespect and insensitivity to the Filipino people's sufferings under the brutal martial law rule\" and urged him \"to reverse this historical wrong\" or risk facing mounting protests and political isolation.\n\nBut Padilla said the guerrillas will remain sincerely engaged in Norway-brokered peace talks that have given them respite from decades of fighting that is estimated to have left about 40,000 combatants and civilians dead.\n\n\"While in a cease-fire, we continue to consolidate our ranks, our recruitment of our forces from the mass bases who are ready to revolt,\" Padilla said.\n\n\"We can talk to (the government) at the table to resolve the people's problems,\" he said, but added, \"We're always prepared for any breakup and continue our armed struggle.\"\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 22, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -9.48837184906006, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 952, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.9710143682500005, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 70, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161128070000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 6.3636363636399995, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 7.35294117647059, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/08/astronaut-and-former-us-senator-john-glenn-dies-at-95.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [688]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 576, "scraper_regex": 823}}, "headline": "Former astronaut and US Senator John Glenn dies at 95", "wordcount_as_scraped": 823, "date": "20161208210000", "story_content": "John Glenn, the all-American astronaut and senator who rocketed into history on flights 36 years apart as the first American to orbit the Earth and the oldest person in space, died Thursday at age 95.\n\n\"We are saddened by the loss of Sen.

Godspeed, John Glenn,\" NASA tweeted immediately after his death was announced.\n\nOLIVER NORTH: JOHN GLENN HAD ALL THE RIGHT STUFF\n\nGlenn died at the James Cancer Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, where he was hospitalized for more than a week.\n\n\"With John's passing, our nation has lost an icon and Michelle and I have lost a friend. \u00a0John spent his life breaking barriers, from defending our freedom as a decorated Marine Corps fighter pilot in World War II and Korea, to setting a transcontinental speed record, to becoming, at age 77, the oldest human to touch the stars,\" President Obama said in a statement.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump praised Glenn in a visit to Ohio State University: \"To me he was a great American hero, a truly great American hero. I met him on two separate occasions. Liked him, always liked him. But he was indeed an American hero.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. ordered congressional flags to be lowered to half-staff.\n\nGlenn, who was known for his small-town decency and calm heroics, was the last of the original Mercury 7 astronauts who launched the US space program. He later served for four terms as a Democratic senator from Ohio.\n\nLAWMAKERS REACT TO JOHN GLENN'S DEATH\n\nIn the early 1960s, the Mercury 7 were American superstars, constantly written about and unabashedly idolized.\n\nIn \"The Right Stuff,\" a 1983 film about them based on Tom Wolfe's best-selling book, Glenn was portrayed by Ed Harris.\n\nGlenn, a Marine pilot who flew 149 missions in World War II and Korea, was America's third man in space (after Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom) but the first to orbit the Earth.\n\nOn February 20, 1962 he piloted the \"Friendship 7\" spacecraft on a three-orbit mission some 100-162 miles from Earth that lasted four hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds.\n\nAfterwards, acclaimed a national hero, he received a ticker-tape parade and addressed a joint session of Congress.\n\nMore than three decades later, at 77 and about to retire as a senator, Glenn lifted off on the space shuttle Discovery on October 29, 1998, becoming the oldest person ever to fly in space.\n\nHis participation was designed to study the effect of space flight on the elderly. Once again, he \u2013 and his crewmates \u2013 received a ticker-tape parade on their safe return.\n\nFor the 50th anniversary of his historic flight on Feb. 20, 2012, Glenn was feted with a number of events, including a dinner with approximately 125 surviving veterans of NASA's Project Mercury.\n\nIn typical self-effacing fashion told them, \"We may be up on the point of that thing and get a lot of the attention, and we had ticker-tape parades and all that sort of thing. But ... you're the ones who deserve the accolade.\"\n\nThe quintessential national hero was born July 18, 1921 in Cambridge, Ohio but moved at age two to New Concord, Ohio where his father operated a plumbing business.\n\nYears later he would write of his early years, \"a boy could not have had a more idyllic early childhood than I did.\"\n\nIt was in New Concord that he met Annie, his wife of 73 years when both were toddlers and their parents were friendly. In his autobiography, he wrote, \"she was a part of my life from the time of my first memory.\"\n\nBy the time they were in high school, they were a couple and were married April 6, 1943 in New Concord. Annie, who had a long public struggle with a speech disability, wore the $125 engagement ring Glenn bought her in 1942 for the rest of her life.\n\nThe couple had two children, John and Carolyn , who survive him, along with his wife.\n\nGlenn, who received a degree in engineering from Muskingum College in New Concord, resigned from the space program in early 1964 to enter politics.\n\nBut a fall in the bathtub, when he suffered a concussion and injured his inner ear, delayed his political plans and in early 1965 he became an executive for Royal Crown Cola.\n\nNine years later, in 1974, he was elected as a Democrat to the US Senate, where he served until 1999.\n\nGlenn's only brush with negative publicity came in 1989, when he was one of five US senators embroiled in the Lincoln Savings and Keating Five Scandal, accused of improperly intervening two years earlier on behalf of Charles F. Keating, Jr., chairman of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.\n\nGlenn was later exonerated but a Senate Commission found he had exercised \"poor judgment.\"\n\nAfter retiring, Glenn and his wife founded the John Glenn Institute for Public Service at Ohio State University.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.29585799574852, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 576, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.49627822141, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.6041666666666696, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/08/trump-to-nominate-epa-critic-pruitt-to-lead-agency.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [231, 360, 738, 982, 1168, 2561, 2988, 3635]}}, "headline": "Trump to nominate EPA critic Pruitt to lead agency", "wordcount_as_scraped": 543, "date": "20161208140000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday that he plans to nominate Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt \u2013 an outspoken critic of the EPA \u2013 to lead the environmental agency.\u00a0\n\n\"For too long, the Environmental Protection Agency has spent taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control anti-energy agenda that has\u00a0destroyed millions of jobs, while also undermining our incredible farmers and many other businesses and industries at every turn,\" Trump said in a statement. \"As my EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, the highly respected Attorney General from the state of Oklahoma, will reverse this trend and restore the EPA's essential mission of keeping our air and our water clean and safe.\"\u00a0\n\nWord of Trump's choice for the Environmental Protection Agency came as the president-elect also named Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as his pick for ambassador to China and asked retired Gen. John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security.\u00a0Trump announced late Wednesday as well that he'll nominate Linda McMahon, former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, as administrator of the Small Business Administration.\u00a0\n\nPruitt may be the most controversial pick of the four.\n\nPruitt, 48, has been a reliable booster of the fossil fuel industry and a critic of what he derides as the EPA's \"activist agenda.\"\n\nRepresenting his state as attorney general since 2011, Pruitt has repeatedly sued the EPA to roll back environmental regulations and other health protections. He joined with other Republican attorneys general in opposing the Clean Power Plan, which seeks to limit planet-warming carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Pruitt has argued that curbing carbon emissions would trample the sovereignty of state governments, drive up electricity rates, threaten the reliability of the nation's power grid and \"create economic havoc.\"\n\nHis installment, if confirmed, would mark a significant break with the current EPA approach toward global warming.\n\nIn an opinion article published earlier this year by National Review, Pruitt suggested the debate over global warming \"is far from settled\" and claimed \"scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.\"\n\nHe also filed court briefs in support of the Keystone XL Pipeline project blocked by the Obama administration, which would have run through his state. And Pruitt sued the EPA over the agency's recent expansion of water bodies regulated under the federal Clean Water Act.\u00a0\n\n\"Respect for private property rights have allowed our nation to thrive, but with the recently finalized rule, farmers, ranchers, developers, industry and individual property owners will now be subject to the unpredictable, unsound and often byzantine regulatory regime of the EPA,\" Pruitt said last year.\n\nAs word of Pruitt's nomination spread Wednesday, environmental and liberal groups quickly responded with condemnation.\u00a0\n\nPublic Citizen called him a \"terrible choice,\" saying in a statement: \"Pruitt is cozy with the oil and gas industry and treats the EPA like an enemy.\"\n\nBusiness leaders in his home state, however, lauded Pruitt's selection, especially those in the oil and gas industry.\n\n\"Scott Pruitt is a businessman and public servant and understands the impact regulation and legislation have in the business world,\" said Jeffrey McDougall, chairman of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. \"His appointment will put rational and reasonable regulation at the forefront.\"\n\nFox News' John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.5163511037826539, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 521, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.76279267542, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 3, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6468330134357, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/28/trump-orders-strict-new-refugee-screening-citing-terrorists.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [73]}}, "headline": "Trump orders strict new refugee screening, citing terrorists", "wordcount_as_scraped": 899, "date": "20170128090000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0President Donald Trump barred all refugees from entering the United States for four months \u2014 and those from war-ravaged Syria indefinitely \u2014 declaring the ban necessary to prevent \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from entering the nation.\n\nThe Friday order immediately suspended a program that last year resettled to the U.S. roughly 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice. Trump indefinitely blocked all those fleeing Syria, where a civil war has displaced millions of people, and imposed a 90-day ban on entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim majority nations.\n\n\"We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,\" Trump said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. \"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\"\n\nTrump said the halt in the refugee program was necessary to give government agencies time to develop a stricter vetting system. But the order did spell out what additional steps he wants the Homeland Security and State departments to take.\n\nThe U.S. may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government will continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBN News, Trump said persecuted Christians would be given priority in applying for refugee status.\n\n\"We are going to help them,\" Trump said. \"They've been horribly treated.\"\n\nThe order was signed on Trump's most robust day of national security and foreign policy at the start of his presidency, marked by a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May and a lengthy phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump called for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration to the U.S. He later shifted his focus to putting in place \"extreme vetting\" procedures to screen people coming to the U.S. from countries with terrorism ties.\n\nThe State Department said the three-month ban in the directive applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen \u2014 all Muslim-majority nations.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, said it would file a federal lawsuit Monday challenging the constitutionality of the executive order.\n\n\"There is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\" said CAIR National Litigation Director Lena F. Masri. \"This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\"\n\nDuring the past budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Barack Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000.\n\nTrump, according to the executive order, plans to cut that to 50,000. Refugee processing was suspended in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and restarted months later.\n\nThe president was applauded by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said it was \"time to re-evaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process.\" Many Democrats cast the measures as un-American.\n\n\"Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\nTrump's order was signed on Holocaust Remembrance Day, which brought to mind the global effort to help refugees during World War II and its aftermath.\n\nThe order makes no mention of a plan to provide safe zones in Syria and the surrounding area. A draft of the order had directed the Pentagon and the State Department to produce a plan for safe zones in the war-torn Mideast nation.\n\nThe president's directive capped a hectic first week for Trump at the White House, giving Americans an initial look at how he intends to position the United States around the globe.\n\nEarlier Friday, he hosted British Prime Minister Theresa May at the White House for his first meeting with a world leader since taking office. Asked about whether he would revert back to Bush-era use of torture, Trump said he would defer to the views of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\n\"He has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it. ... I don't necessarily agree,\" Trump said. \"But I would tell you that he will override because I'm giving him that power. He's an expert.\"\n\nThe Associated Press and other news organizations have obtained copies of a draft executive order signaling sweeping changes to U.S. interrogation and detention policy. The draft, which the White House said was not official, also requests recommendations on whether the U.S. should reopen CIA detention facilities outside the United States. Critics said the clandestine sites have marred America's image on the world stage.\n\nTrump held firm Friday on another controversy \u2014 trade and illegal immigration from Mexico. He told reporters he had a \"very good call\" with Pena Nieto earlier in the day, but he reaffirmed his belief that Mexico has \"outnegotiated and beat us to a pulp\" on trade \u2014 and that would change.\n\n\"We're no longer going to be the country that doesn't know what it's doing,\" he declared a day after the Mexican leader canceled his visit to Washington in response to Trump's plans to build a border wall and have Mexico pay for it.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ken Thomas at http://twitter.com/kthomasDC\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.64102554321289, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 880, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 19, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.235064799809999, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 9, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 57, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170128090000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 6.47727272727273, "mft_mean": 5.18181818182}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/30/in-pakistan-family-deal-is-made-girl-is-given-as-bride.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [79]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1071, "scraper_regex": 1152}}, "headline": "In a Pakistan family, deal is made, a girl is given as bride", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1152, "date": "20161230070000", "story_content": "JAMPUR, Pakistan \u2013 \u00a0Mohammad Ramzan can neither hear nor speak, and he has a childlike mind. But he knew his wife, Saima, was too young when she was given to him as a bride.\n\nThe 36-year-old Ramzan smiles, eager to please, as he uses his fingers to count out her age when they married. One, two, three . . . until 13, and then he stops and looks at her, points and nods several times.\n\nThe girl's father, Wazir Ahmed, says she was 14, not 13, but her age was beside the point. It mattered only that she had reached puberty when he arranged her marriage as an exchange: his daughter for Ramzan's sister, whom he wanted to take as a second wife.\n\nHis first wife, Saima's mother, had given him only daughters, and he hoped his second wife would give him a son. But Sabeel wouldn't marry him until her brother had a wife to care for him.\n\nShe would be a bride in exchange for a bride.\n\n\"We gave a girl in this family for a girl in their family,\" Ahmed says. \"That is our right.\"\n\nIn deeply conservative regions such as this one in the south of Punjab province, the tribal practice of exchanging girls between families is so entrenched, it even has its own name in Urdu: Watta Satta, which means give and take.\n\nA girl may be given away to pay a debt or settle a dispute between feuding families. She might be married to a cousin to keep her dowry in the family or, as in this case, married for the prospect of a male heir.\n\nMany believe that their Islamic religion instructs fathers to marry off their daughters at puberty.\n\n\"If it is not done, our society thinks parents have not fulfilled their religious obligation,\" says Faisal Tangwani, regional coordinator for the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in nearby Multan.\n\nAhmed sees the hand of God in his daughter's marriage to a disabled man.\n\n\"It was by God's will that he was chosen,\" he says. \"It was her fate.\"\n\nAhmed sits inside the mud-walled compound where he lives now with his two wives. Outside, stray dogs roam in packs of three and four. They bite, Ahmed warns.\n\nHe says that the fact that Ramzan is nearly three times his daughter's age is irrelevant. But the legal marrying age here is 16, and in a rare move, police did investigate Saima's marriage after they received a complaint, possibly from a relative involved in a dispute with her father.\n\nRamzan and Ahmed were jailed for a few days, but Saima testified in court that she was 16 and they were released. She says she told the authorities she was 16 to protect her father and husband.\n\nIn Saima's world of crushing poverty, where centuries-old tribal traditions mix with religious beliefs, a crippling cycle traps even the perpetrators with a life's burden: a father who longs for a son to help support his family; a wife who must provide that son; a daughter who must become a mother even when she is still a child.\n\nSaima's mother, Janaat, agrees with marrying off her daughters early. She says girls are a headache after they reach puberty. They can't be left at home alone for fear of unwanted sexual activity \u2014 or worse, the daughter leaves home with a boy of her choice.\n\n\"That would be a shame for us. We would have no honor. No. When they reach puberty quickly, we have to marry them,\" she says. \"Daughters are a burden, but the sons, they are the owners of the house.\"\n\nShe says she accepted her husband's marriage to another woman; after all, it's her fault he only has daughters.\n\n\"I feel shame that I don't have a son. I myself allowed my husband to get a second wife,\" she says.\n\nHer husband's new wife, Sabeel, says she agreed to marry Ahmed because of her brother. She wanted him to have a wife.\n\n\"No one had been willing to give their daughters to my brother,\" she says.\n\nRamzan is quick to extend his hand to guests who enter through the torn and tattered curtain that hangs over the front door to his compound, tucked away in a narrow alley lined with open sewers.\n\nRamzan's elderly parents live with him. His father rarely leaves his bed, saying he has trouble walking. His mother begs from morning until night, sometimes knocking on doors, other times parking herself in the middle of a dusty road, her hand outstretched for donations.\n\nLike Ramzan, she can neither hear nor speak. Both her hips and one knee have been broken. She gestures as if breaking a twig to explain her troubled knee.\n\nRamzan looks at Saima, her hair hidden beneath a sweeping shawl, her large brown eyes downcast.\n\n\"I didn't want to marry her so young. I said at the time, 'She is too young,' but everyone said I must,\" he says through a series of gestures interpreted by those around him. He held his hand up just below his chest, showing how tall she was when they married.\n\nSaima doesn't talk much. Her answers are short, and matter-of-fact.\n\n\"His sister and my father fell in love and they exchanged me,\" Saima says.\n\n\"Yes, I am afraid of my father, but it is his decision who I will marry and when.\"\n\nShe picks at the rope bed where she sits with Ramzan. Her husband often reaches to touch the top of her head.\n\nHe gestures that he is afraid Saima will leave him one day, and says that God will be unhappy if she does. Saima had gotten pregnant soon after she came to live with Ramzan but lost the child at five months. Ramzan gestures that he wants Saima to take some medicine to help her get pregnant again.\n\nSaima rarely looks in his direction but says she has no quarrel with him, nor does she plan to leave.\n\nSaima says she understands her husband's gestures, but it's hard to know. Most of the translations are done by his 12-year-old niece, Haseena, Sabeel's daughter from the previous marriage.\n\nHaseena was 10 when Saima married her uncle Ramzan and her mother left to live with the new bride's father.\n\nHaseena stayed in the house with her uncle and her elderly grandparents to cook, clean and keep Saima company.

Koreans' ties with Samsung are lifelong, often conflicted", "wordcount_as_scraped": 824, "date": "20170119130000", "story_content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2013 \u00a0The family smartphones? An assortment of Samsung Galaxies. The flat-screen TV that illuminates the living room? A Samsung SUHD, with the brand name sparkling on the nameplate. The maker of the digital toilet seat? You guessed it: Samsung.\n\nIt's difficult for people outside South Korea to fully grasp what Samsung, a truly global brand, means inside its home country, where it is far more than just another big company. It is seen variously as both a talisman and a millstone, as national savior and greedy business behemoth. Those diverse views only intensified Thursday when a court rejected prosecutors' request to arrest Samsung heir and Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong in the corruption scandal surrounding impeached South Korean President Park Geun-hye.\n\nSamsung is inextricably woven into the psychological fabric of this small, proud country, where a reverence for wealth, power and prestige is linked to rapid economic growth after the Korean War, when authoritarian government policies favored big businesses.\n\nA complex mix of admiration and resentment was on full display when Lee, held by authorities for more than 12 hours, was released Thursday after a court said there was not \"enough justification for a (formal) arrest at this stage.\"\n\nProsecutors said Lee gave 43 billion won ($36 million) in bribes to Park and Choi Soon-sil, her confidante, seeking support for a contentious merger.\n\nMany South Koreans flooded social media with complaints that the court decision showed their country remains in thrall to Samsung and other big chaebol, the conglomerates that dominate the nation's economy, jobs and investment.\n\n\"There was no justice when the judicial system threw a cold blanket on this opportunity to change a rotten society,\" said Lee Jong-ran, a labor lawyer and Samsung critic who added that the judge \"overturned a desperate chance to crack the chaebol system.\"\n\nBut the prospect of the Samsung heir's arrest also stirred anger, and even worries that it could harm the country's economy.\n\n\"Samsung feeds about 30 percent of our people,\" said Han Hyo-jung, a 72-year-old self-described \"patriot.\" ''I think it's too much to put him in detention. ... We must not humiliate Samsung internationally.\"\n\nSamsung played a major role as South Korea, formally known as the Republic of Korea, rose from the rubble of war and the anguish of dictatorship and colonization into an Asian powerhouse.\n\nThis is reflected in a longtime nickname that mixes the joking and the bitter: The Republic of Samsung.\n\n\"It's still the nameplate company of the nation, and it's the ideal place to get a job. It brings joy, prestige and wealth to graduates and their families,\" Geoffrey Cain, a Seoul-based journalist writing a forthcoming book on Samsung, said in an email. But \"this is where the problems start. Since it's indispensable to the nation, in this Republic of Samsung, there's a lot of resentment over its power.\"\n\nLee, 48, who has been de facto Samsung chief since his father's 2014 heart attack, embodies the love-hate relationship.\n\nIn a country where many young people struggle to find a job, Lee controls a fortune estimated at nearly $6 billion thanks to his father, who ordered Samsung companies to sell his son shares at illegally cheap prices whose value skyrocketed later, giving him massive, quick wealth without having to pay big inheritance taxes. Lee's management skills remain unproven, though he was groomed his entire adult life to lead the jewel of the family dynasty, Samsung Electronics, which, along with its affiliated companies, accounts for about a third of the market value in South Korea's main stock market.\n\nHe is the public face of a company that, in a familiar refrain, can hover over a South Korean from cradle to grave. Its presence is breathtaking:\n\nYou can be born in a Samsung hospital and live in a Samsung-built apartment with a Samsung washing machine, Samsung fridge, Samsung TV and Samsung vacuum cleaner. You can go to a school on a Samsung scholarship and work on a Samsung-powered laptop.\n\nDon't have a Samsung smartphone? Even iPhones have Samsung memory chips.\n\nYou can go to a Samsung amusement park and stay at a Samsung hotel. You can buy gifts at Samsung duty-free shops, wear Samsung clothes and protect yourself with Samsung insurance. Even if you don't get a coveted job at Samsung, your employer is likely to rely on the conglomerate \u2014 for advertising, say, or to cater the food in the company cafeteria, or as a crucial customer.\n\nEven if a South Korean somehow avoided all of those ties, the national pension fund, the world's third-largest, is a huge investor in Samsung companies.\n\nAnd what would happen if Samsung collapsed? Park Sang-in, a professor at Seoul National University, estimates it would trigger a 7 percentage point rise in the nation's unemployment rate, the collapse of its insurance industry and overall economic woes not seen in South Korea since the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this story.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.15175533294678, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 790, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.19865674287, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170119130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.67088607594937, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/05/ryan-blasts-decision-to-block-dakota-access-pipeline-route.html": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Ryan blasts decision to block Dakota Access pipeline route", "wordcount_as_scraped": 804, "date": "20161205060000", "story_content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan called the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' decision Sunday to deny a government permit for the Dakota Access oil pipeline in southern North Dakota \"big government decision-making at its worst.\"\n\nRyan, R-Wis., tweeted out his displeasure hours after the decision was made. He added that he looks \"forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us.\"\n\nThe decision handed a victory to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters, who argued the project would threaten the tribe's water source and cultural sites.\n\nRyan comments echoed the sentiments of other North Dakota leaders. Gov. Jack Dalrymple called it a \"serious mistake\" that prolongs the dangerous situation\" of having several hundred protesters who are camped out on federal land during the bitter winter season. U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer said it's a \"very chilling signal\" for the future of infrastructure in the United States.\n\nThe company building the pipeline, Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners, slammed President Obama's administration in a statement, calling the move political.\n\nThe company said the decision was \"just the latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions by an administration which has abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency.\" \n\nThe company reiterated its plan to complete construction of the pipeline without rerouting around Lake Oahe.\n\nThe four-state, $3.8 billion project is largely complete except for the now-blocked segment underneath Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir. Assistant Secretary for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy said in a news release that her decision was based on the need to \"explore alternate routes\" for the pipeline's crossing. Her full decision doesn't rule out that it could cross under the reservoir or north of Bismarck.\n\n\"Although we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access, it's clear that there's more work to do,\" Darcy said. \"The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing.\"\n\nThe news was met by cheers and chants of \"mni wichoni\" \u2013 \"water is life\" in Lakota Sioux. Some in the crowd banged rums. Miles Allard, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux, said he was pleased but remained cautious, saying, \"We don't know what Trump is going to do.\"\n\n\"The whole world is watching,\" Allard added. \"I'm telling all our people to stand up and not to leave until this is over.\"\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch said Sunday that the Department of Justice will \"continue to monitor the situation\" and stands \"ready to provide resources to help all those who can play a constructive role in easing tensions.\"\n\n\"The safety of everyone in the area - law enforcement officers, residents and protesters alike - continues to be our foremost concern,\" she added.\n\nMorton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier, whose department has done much of the policing for the protests, said that \"local law enforcement does not have an opinion\" on the easement and that his department will continue to \"enforce the law.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary for the Interior Sally Jewell said in a statement that the Corps' \"thoughtful approach ... ensures that there will be an in-depth evaluation of alternative routes for the pipeline and a closer look at potential impacts.\"\n\nEarlier Sunday, an organizer with Veterans Stand for Standing Rock said tribal elders had asked the military veterans not to have confrontations with law enforcement officials, adding the group is there to help out those who've dug in against the project.\n\nAbout 250 veterans gathered about a mile from the main camp for a meeting with organizer Wes Clark Jr., the son of former Democratic presidential candidate Gen. Wesley Clark. The group had said about 2,000 veterans were coming, but it wasn't clear how many actually arrived.\n\n\"We have been asked by the elders not to do direct action,\" Wes Clark Jr. said. He added that the National Guard and law enforcement have armored vehicles and are armed, warning: \"If we come forward, they will attack us.\"\n\nInstead, he told the veterans, \"If you see someone who needs help, help them out.\"\n\nAuthorities moved a blockade from the north end of the Backwater Bridge with the conditions that protesters stay south of it and come there only if there is a prearranged meeting. Authorities also asked protesters not to remove barriers on the bridge, which they have said was damaged in the late October conflict that led to several people being hurt, including a serious arm injury.\n\n\"That heavy presence is gone now and I really hope in this de-escalation they'll see that, and in good faith . the leadership in those camps will start squashing the violent factions,\" Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said in a statement, reiterating that any violation will \"will result in their arrest.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.19148945808411, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 789, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.4473609501599998, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.54879594423321, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/05/saving-america-from-economic-cultural-and-physical-collapse.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00ef": [976]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 621, "scraper_regex": 699}}, "headline": "Saving America from economic, cultural and physical collapse", "wordcount_as_scraped": 699, "date": "20161105190000", "story_content": "Earlier this year Ahmad Rahami, a naturalized American from Afghanistan, allegedly detonated several bombs in New York and New Jersey. Luckily, these attacks only wounded 31 people. This is but one example of the reality that America is fighting for its life, but most do not understand the gravity of the challenges we face. In fact, the United States is fighting for its existence on three fronts: economic, cultural and physical.\n\nHere's a snapshot of the situation:\n\n\u2022 Economic: GDP growth is stagnant at about 1 percent. It should be 3-4 percent.\n\n\u2022 Cultural: The American Constitution and way of life are under constant attack from enemies determined to destroy our liberties and our lives.\n\n\u2022 Physical: On national security, countless state and non-state actors are working to disrupt our day-to-day existence.\n\nWe are exposed on all three fronts because political, business and cultural leaders are either na\u00efve, willfully blind or corrupt and complicit in flatlining the economy, allowing our traditions to be trampled over and making our citizens vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe people who have created this dire situation believe in one or more of these four false narratives: globalism, socialism, isolationism and \"Political Islam.\" The first three narratives have been in the American mainstream for decades, but political Islam is different. Under the guise of a religion, political Islam has penetrated our culture, politics and media.\n\n\"Political Islam\" refers to the politicization of Islam. It preaches hate. It demands that non-Muslims must be killed or submit to Islamic law. It calls for global rule and it uses physical, intellectual, financial, legal and demographic means to attain it. To save America and Western civilization, we must defeat Political Islam. We must commit ourselves to destroying the forces that attack us every minute of every day.\n\nHere are several policies that would return America to leadership in the world:\n\nOn the economic front: The government must get out of the way. We must reduce the tax burden on every American citizen and business. All wages should be taxed together under three brackets of 10, 20 and 30 percent. The corporate tax rate should be 20 percent, not 35 percent, which is the highest rate in the developed world. ObamaCare must be repealed and replaced with a plan that increases choice, keeps the government out of the physician-patient relationship and doesn't crush small businesses. We must stop the government's intergenerational theft, or our children and grandchildren will never be able to repay the current level of overspending. Lastly, all states must enact energy and right-to-work policies to allow for innovation and investment.\n\nOn the cultural front: Adherence to core values made America strong. The U.S. must re-instill the values of the Founding Fathers: liberty and opportunity on top of a strong Judeo-Christian base. We must return to the constitutionally dictated balance of power shared by the three branches of government. To revive American exceptionalism, we must defend our freedom of speech against the false narrative of political correctness. Voter fraud must be eliminated. To ensure the integrity of our elections, Americans must be required to have photo identification when going to the ballot box.\n\nOn the physical front: We must defeat the four leading Political Islamic terror organizations: Shiite Iran, ISIS/al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood and Wahhabism/Salafism. These entities indiscriminately terrorize and kill Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus and all others. In fact, Muslims are the No. 1 victims of Political Islam, as evidenced in Syria, Iraq and Iran. The ideology that feeds these entities must be debunked, and their leaders must be removed. Defeating them must begin by stopping Iran's radicalism and nuclear agenda, eliminating ISIS/al-Qaeda by any means necessary, rooting out the Muslim Brotherhood in any country where it operates and pressuring Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States and Pakistan to reform the jihadist Wahhabism/Salafism ideology. To protect the homeland, we must screen all refugees and immigrants, seal our borders and secure our critical infrastructure by protecting the electric grid from natural disasters, cyber/GPS hacking and electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) attack.\n\nThe American voter should keep these core issues in mind as we vote on November 8!\n\n\n\nKen Abramowitz is founder of savethewest.com, a public service website dedicated to saving western civilization from itself.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.47570323944092, "HarmVice": 12, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 621, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.49261322042, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161105190000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 5.7971014492753605, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/06/anti-trumpers-trying-to-sow-chaos-in-electoral-college.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3238]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 536, "scraper_regex": 574}}, "headline": "Anti-Trumpers trying to sow chaos in Electoral College", "wordcount_as_scraped": 574, "date": "20161206170000", "story_content": "Amid a rowdy recount push in battleground states, anti-Donald Trump forces are escalating efforts to invalidate his election on another front: the Electoral College.\n\nThe people who technically choose the next president will gather on Dec. 19 to, presumably, make the results of the Nov. 8 presidential election official. Trump won 306 electoral votes in the election, well above the 270 needed to defeat Hillary Clinton and claim the White House.\n\nBut even as Clinton herself has conceded and joined President Obama in urging a smooth transition of power, a group of electors from Colorado and Washington known as the \"Hamilton Electors\" is trying to persuade other electors to unite behind a Republican alternative to Trump.\n\nOn Monday, they peeled off one Republican. Chris Suprun, from Texas, said he won't cast one of his state's 38 electoral votes for Trump because \"I am here to elect a president, not a king.\"\n\nSuprun previously indicated he would support Trump. But he now says the president-elect's postelection attacks on the First Amendment, as well as the billionaire businessman's continued promotion of his brand and business interests overseas, changed his mind.\n\nThe anti-Trump electors, however, face a very steep climb. In total, they would need to persuade 37 electors to either abstain from voting or switch their vote from Trump to someone else. This would throw the vote for president to the House of Representatives.\n\nTexas law doesn't mandate that electors vote according to the results of the state's presidential election, which Trump won by nine percentage points over Clinton.\n\nBut a majority of states bind their electors to the state's popular-vote winner, complicating efforts to switch those votes.\n\n\"It's clearly a binding position,\" Cherilyn Eagar, a Utah elector, told The Salt Lake Tribune of the law in her state, dismissing efforts to get fellow electors to defect from Trump.\n\nThe same newspaper notes that some attorney groups have offered to defend electors who try to defy the will of their states.\n\nPolitico reported Monday that advocates of the latest stop-Trump plan have been in touch with Clinton allies, though Clinton and her campaign have not commented on the plan. Clinton likewise has not gotten behind Green Party candidate Jill Stein's efforts to pursue a recount in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\nThe plan for Electoral College chaos doesn't necessarily hold promise for Clinton anyway.\n\nAnti-Trump electors are pushing for members of the Electoral College to support a Republican alternative in order to bring Trump's number down \u2013 not elevate Clinton's.\n\nAccording to Politico, Democratic electors backing the push are leaning toward Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran unsuccessfully for president, as the likely alternative.\n\nSuprun said he \"would have to strongly consider someone like Kasich who has both executive and legislative experience bringing people together.\"\n\nSuprun said he was waiting to see if other electors revolt and rally behind a Trump alternative like Kasich.\n\n\"I'm looking for someone we can all unify behind,\" he said.\n\nThe Kasich camp is pushing back on efforts to put forward his name on Dec. 19.\u00a0\n\nKasich himself tweeted Tuesday that he's not a candidate and urged electors not to vote for him:\n\nAdviser John Weaver told Politico: \"There's no question Trump won enough votes in the states to receive over 270 votes when the members of the Electoral College meet.\" He voiced confidence the Electoral College \"will affirm this when it gathers later this month.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.844594597816467, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 536, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.67628081042, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161206170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.23880597014925, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/03/us-trained-dolphins-to-help-locate-mexico-vaquita-porpoise.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [74]}}, "headline": "US-trained dolphins to help locate Mexico's vaquita porpoise", "wordcount_as_scraped": 624, "date": "20170104060000", "story_content": "MEXICO CITY \u2013 \u00a0U.S. Navy-trained dolphins and their handlers will participate in a last-ditch effort to catch, enclose and protect the last few dozen of Mexico's critically endangered vaquita porpoises to save them from extinction.\n\nInternational experts confirmed the participation of the Navy Marine Mammal Program in the effort, which is expected to start sometime this spring.\n\nJim Fallin of the U.S. Navy Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific said Tuesday that the dolphins' participation is still in the planning stage.\n\nThe dolphins will use their natural sonar to locate the extremely elusive vaquitas, then surface and advise their handlers.\n\n\"Their specific task is to locate\" vaquitas, which live only in the Gulf of California, Fallin said. \"They would signal that by surfacing and returning to the boat from which they were launched.\"\n\nThe dolphins have been trained by the Navy for tasks like locating sea mines.\n\nThe vaquitas, the world's smallest and most endangered porpoise species, have been decimated by illegal fishing for the swim bladder of a fish, the totoaba, which is a prized delicacy in China.\n\nAlthough the vaquita has never been held successfully in captivity, experts hope to put the remaining porpoises in floating pens in a safe bay in the Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez, where they can be protected and hopefully breed.\n\nLorenzo Rojas-Bracho, chairman of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita, wrote that \"an international group of experts, including Navy personnel, have been working on two primary goals: determining the feasibility of locating and catching vaquitas, as a phase One. And as a second phase, to determine the feasibility of temporarily housing vaquitas in the Gulf of California.\"\n\nRojas-Bracho said the effort by the international team of experts \"would involve locating them, capturing them and putting them in some kind of protective area,\" probably a floating enclosure or pen in a protected bay where they would not be endangered by fishing nets. Mexico has banned gill nets that often trap vaquitas in the area, but has had trouble enforcing it because the totoaba draws very high prices on the illegal market.\n\n\"At the current rate of loss, the vaquita will likely decline to extinction by 2022 unless the current gillnet ban is maintained and effectively enforced,\" Rojas-Bracho wrote.\n\nAccording to rough estimates, with vaquita population numbers falling by 40 percent annually, and only 60 alive a year ago, there could be as few as three dozen left.\n\nSome experts, like Omar Vidal, Mexico director of the World Wildlife Fund, oppose the capture plan, which could risk killing the few remaining vaquitas and open up a free-for-all of illegal fishing once they are removed from their natural habitat. \"We must strive to save this porpoise where it belongs: in a healthy Upper Gulf of California,\" he said.\n\nCatch-and-enclose is risky. The few remaining females could die during capture, dooming the species. Breeding in captivity has successfully saved species such as the red wolf and California condor, but the vaquita has only been scientifically described since the 1950s and has never been bred or even held in captivity.\n\nExperts including Rojas-Bracho; Barbara Taylor, leader of Marine Mammal Genetics Program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and Sarah Mesnick of the NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center, stressed that the capture program \"should not divert effort and resources away from extension and enforcement of the gillnet ban, which remains the highest-priority conservation actions for the species.\"\n\nVeterinarians will evaluate vaquitas' reactions and release stressed individuals, they wrote. Should a death occur, the team will re-evaluate the sanctuary strategy.\n\n\"It is important to stress that the recovery team goal is to return vaquita from the temporary sanctuary into a gillnet-free environment,\" they wrote.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.5015015602111799, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 614, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.8763424946, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.6058631921824102, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/27/gingrich-other-half-trumps-jobs-jobs-jobs-promise-hint-its-about-skills.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 903, "scraper_regex": 997}}, "headline": "Gingrich: The other half of Trump's 'jobs, jobs, jobs' promise (hint : it's about skills)", "wordcount_as_scraped": 997, "date": "20161227210000", "story_content": "President-elect Trump has said that his administration will be focused on three very important words: Jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nHe has outlined a bold agenda to achieve 4 percent economic growth in America, and much of that agenda involves undoing the Obama administration's disastrous regulations that get in the way of job creation.\n\nBut job creation is only half the challenge. Americans must have the skills necessary to do the jobs that are created under this new, more dynamic economy.\n\nMeeting this goal will also require undoing the harmful actions of the Obama administration, specifically the devastating impact his Department of Education is having on career education in America.\n\nCareer education is distinct from the four-year Bachelor of Arts and Science programs you might think of as higher education. Career education certificates and associate degrees typically take 1 or 2 years, respectively, and rather than providing a broad-based education, they are specifically tailored to prepare students for specific jobs.\n\nThe demand for these programs is growing. Since 2003, per the National Center for Education Statistics, the number of certificate degrees awarded has increased by 40.9 percent and the number of associates degrees awarded has increased by 50.8 percent. This is a much faster rate of increase than the growth in Bachelor's and Master's degrees of 33 percent.\n\nMany of these programs are offered at community colleges, but private sector career schools play a vital role as well. In 2014, more than one-third of certificates and almost one-sixth of associate degrees in America were awarded by private sector career colleges.\n\nIn fact, these numbers understate how critical private sector schools are to certain industries.\n\nHealth care is a prime example. According to a recent analysis of Department of Education data by Career Education Colleges and Universities, 78 percent of vocational/practical nurses and nursing assistants, 74 percent of medical assistants, 43 percent of ultrasound technicians, and 39 percent of surgical technologists are educated at private sector colleges and universities.\n\nThe fields of computer networking, electrical and electronic engineering, heating and ventilation installation and airplane and auto repair also disproportionately rely on private sector career schools to provide workers with the skills necessary to fill critical jobs.\n\nDisgracefully, despite the vital nature of private sector career education to the American economy, the Obama administration has launched an ideologically motivated assault on private sector schools.\n\nOver the past four years, the Department of Education forced almost 900 private sector campuses into closure, throwing tens of thousands of students out on the street \u2013 many of them low-income adults, single parents and African-Americans and Latinos.\n\nIn just the past thirty days \u2013 in a final effort to cause as much damage to private sector schools before President-elect Trump takes office \u2013 the Obama Department of Education has revoked the accreditation status of ACICS \u2013 a national accreditor which certifies many private sector career schools in America, and deliberately done to immediately put almost over 700 schools in serious jeopardy.\n\nJust as President-elect Trump has made it clear that he intends to undo many of the Obama administration's disastrous regulations that hurt job creation, his administration should swiftly announce it will take steps to undo the damage President Obama has done to career education in America.\n\nFirst, the Trump administration should announce that it will give ACICS 12 months to correct the deficiencies which the Obama administration used as an excuse to try and shut them down. This is a standard grace period that the Department of Education normally gives after notifying an accreditor that it is not meeting certain standards. The only reason ACICS was not given this same courtesy is because the Obama administration viewed them as a vehicle through which they could attack private sector schools.\n\nIn addition, the Trump administration should announce that it intends to make the disastrous Gainful Employment Rule open for review. This rule, which I have written about before, removes programs from eligibility for federally backed student loans if the earnings of its graduates do not meet an arbitrary debt/earnings threshold in three years.\n\nAs predicted by many, the rule is hurting students rather than helping them. For instance, students in lower wage states are having their opportunities for career advancement eliminated simply due to differences in the cost of living. The rule also doesn't appreciate that many fields \u2013 such as the culinary arts and design programs \u2013 require a period of apprenticeship, which means that graduates will not necessarily realize the real value of their degrees in just three years.\n\nThe Trump administration should also announce that two rules which have not yet gone into effect \u2013 the Borrower Defense to Repayment (projected to cost over $16 billion over ten years) and the State Authorization Rule \u2013 will be immediately withdrawn. Instead, Congress and the Trump administration should work together to craft better solutions when they reauthorize the Higher Education Act later this year.\n\nThere is clear precedent for these actions provided by none other than President Obama himself.\n\nIn 2009, his Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel sent directives to all departments and agencies instructing them not only to withdraw all rules which were not yet implemented, but also to act to stop \"rules which raise substantial questions of law or policy.\" The biased rulemaking and regulatory enforcement of the Department of Education against private sector schools certainly rises to this standard.\n\nPresident-elect Trump can show that he is indeed focused on jobs and send a signal now that the assault on career education will come to an end in his administration. Only then will Americans have access to the vital skills education they need to get good jobs in the 21st century.\n\n\n\nNewt Gingrich, a Republican, was speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 1999.

Now, they're turning to an oversight tool used successfully only once before to void a rule issued by a federal agency.\n\nAll that will be required to make the regulation invalid is a simple majority of both GOP-led chambers approving a joint resolution of disapproval -- and the president's signature. The House will take the first crack this week.\n\nA look at the regulations being targeted:\n\nRule to reduce methane emissions on public and tribal lands\n\nThe Interior Department updated its regulations to require oil and gas producers to limit flaring, the controlled burning of natural gas for safety, maintenance and other reasons. Also required are inspections for leaks and replacement of equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. Most of the gas being burned is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that's potent at trapping heat.\n\nFOR: Environmental groups said the rule will reduce up to 180,000 tons of released gas annually, a small step in slowing global warming. They also say that reducing the amount of gas lost through flaring means more gas will be captured to pay for the necessary updates to equipment and power hundreds of thousands of homes.\n\nAGAINST: Industry groups said the rule comes at a time when methane emissions are already falling, and combined with other new regulations, will drive energy production off federal lands. That means less federal revenue and higher costs for consumers.\n\nRule to lessen the environmental impact of coal mining on nearby streams\n\nThe rule would maintain a buffer zone that blocks coal mining within 100 feet of streams, but imposes stricter exceptions to the 100-foot rule. It also beefs up requirements for monitoring water quality and restoring corridors near streams to protect fish and wildlife.\n\nFOR: Environmental groups and some Appalachian residents say greater protections are needed to preserve healthy drinking water and ensure mining companies don't leave an environmental mess after mining ceases.\n\nAGAINST: Coal mining companies are already facing pricing pressures from greater reliance on natural gas and renewables, and they said the rule would lead to the loss of tens of thousands of direct mining jobs and many thousands more indirectly as massive volumes of coal would become too expensive to mine.\n\nRule to increase disclosure requirements for federal contractors\n\nThe rule requires prospective and existing contractors to disclose violation of 14 federal labor laws when bidding on contracts. The information would be included as part of a contracting officer's decision to award or extend a contract.\n\nFOR: Labor unions say contractors who cut corners with worker protections are likely to cut corners in other ways, too. And that can be a bad deal for taxpayers and employees.\n\nAGAINST: Business groups said the new rule will add compliance costs for many companies, and smaller firms especially will find the risk outweighs the reward for performing government work. Others fear that government officials will include violations not fully adjudicated to deny granting a contract to a company.\n\nRule requiring companies to disclose payments made to the U.S. and foreign governments relating to mining and drilling.\n\nThe rule stems from passage of the Dodd-Frank law in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nFOR: Advocacy groups such as Oxfam America say that greater transparency allows citizens in some of the world's most impoverished countries to hold their governments accountable for the wealth generated through mining and drilling.\n\nAGAINST: Industry groups such as the American Petroleum Institute and U.S. Chamber of Commerce unsuccessfully filed suit to stop the rule. They said it requires U.S. companies to hand over key details of how they bid and compete while many foreign competitors are under no obligation to do the same.\n\nRule requiring the Social Security Administration to forward the names of certain disabled beneficiaries to the Justice Department for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System\n\nFollowing the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, massacre, President Obama directed the Department of Justice to provide guidance to agencies regarding information they are obligated to report to the background check system. The Social Security Administration issued a final rule Dec. 19. \n\nUnder the rule, SSA will forward the names of beneficiaries with mental impairments who also need a third party to manage their benefits. The rule would affect an estimated 80,000 beneficiaries between age 18 and retirement. Those who have their names reported would have a right to appeal.\n\nFOR: Some groups seeking stricter gun laws and family members of the disabled expressed support. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said it appreciated the agency's efforts to submit pertinent information to keep guns out of the hands of those \"that we all agree should not have access to them.\"\n\nAGAINST: Gun rights groups led by the NRA said the regulation would strip from the \"most vulnerable in America\" the right to keep and bear arms. Advocacy groups for the disabled also weighed in, including a federal agency charged with advising the president and Congress on government policy. The National Council on Disability said there is no nexus between the inability to manage money and the ability to safely possess and use a firearm.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.8027571439743, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 854, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.53243423222, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170129150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.04449648711944, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/03/sen-mike-rounds-time-for-real-strategy-to-keep-americans-safe-from-cyber-threats.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [153, 203, 239, 274, 727, 886, 887, 1588, 1604, 2433, 2835, 2929, 3078, 3082, 3107, 3127, 3719, 3837, 4124, 4128, 4419, 4421]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 698, "scraper_regex": 763}}, "headline": "Sen.

Some Clinton supporters believe the hack swayed voters toward the president-elect, while some Trump voters assert that the publicity of the attacks stems from yet another post-mortem excuse from the losing side.\n\nNo matter which camp one is in, it should be apparent to all Americans that the United States is not immune to damaging cyber-attacks from hostile foreign nations and other bad actors. We must update our national security policies to deter such attacks before a future debilitating attack occurs, possibly on civilian critical infrastructure.\n\nSenior officials at the Pentagon have been warning about a \"Cyber\u00a09/11\" or \"Cyber\u00a0Pearl Harbor\" for years. We already know that foreign actors have attempted to access the cyber domains of critical infrastructure in the U.S.\n\nImagine what would happen if a foreign actor interfered with the operations of a nuclear power plant, or shut down the communications that control aircraft operations, rail operations or water releases from large dams. Such an attack on our critical infrastructure could threaten our entire economy or \u2013 worse \u2013 lead to loss of life. Without an appropriate plan in place to stop or respond to these cyber-attacks, we put ourselves at increased risk for a catastrophic attack to occur.\n\nAs a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, broadening our national defense policies to adequately address cyber-attacks on civilian critical infrastructure has been a priority of mine. I am\u00a0glad that Congress included a provision in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which would begin the process of defining when an act in cyber space constitutes an act of war. With language similar to my Cyber Act of War Act, the NDAA will require the administration to determine when a cyber-attack on the United States requires a military response. This is vital because, while current\u00a0policies permit the Pentagon to respond to a cyber-attack against military forces, our nation\u00a0does not have a clear policy to govern our response to attacks on civilian infrastructure. The NDAA seeks to change that.\n\nNow that the NDAA is law,\u00a0the\u00a0administration will have\u00a0until December 2017\u00a0to give Congress a report on when a cyber act would warrant a military response. In preparing this report, the administration must consider (1) the ways in which the effects of a cyber-attack may be equivalent to effects of an attack using conventional kinetic weapons, including with respect to physical destruction and casualties, and (2) intangible effects of significant scope, intensity or duration.\n\nDefining when a cyber-attack requires a military response is but one in a series of steps we must take to deter our enemies from attacking the United States with this new, sophisticated\u00a0form of aggression.\n\nWhile our national focus may be on whether the Russian hack allegations warrant an investigation\u00a0and Obama's recent retaliation will deter future attacks, we must not lose sight of the fact we need a defined strategy for how to keep Americans safe from cyber-threats.\n\nWe cannot know if the alleged hacks in 2016 would have been thwarted had the provisions of my Cyber Act of War Act\u00a0had\u00a0already been in law. What we do know is that, absent a clear message to our adversaries as to when a cyber-attack may warrant a U.S. military response, we will not have done all we can to deter devastating attacks in the future. Recent events have shown that such action is urgently needed.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\nMarion Michael \"Mike\" Rounds is the junior senator from South Dakota, currently serving his first term in office.

In a marked departure from his fiery stump speeches during the election campaign on behalf of Hillary Clinton, he chose not to attack Trump directly, but called for America to rediscover a sense of common purpose.\n\nHe gave a sign that he may follow this himself, by saying about plans to gut ObamaCare: \"if\u00a0anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we've made to our health care system \u2013 that covers as many people at less cost \u2013 I will publicly support it.\"\n\nYet, while citing his achievements, Obama warned that particularly on racial and economic inequality, America's democracy still faces serious threats, warning race is still a divisive force in the country.\n\n\"After\u00a0my election, there was talk of a post-racial america.

All of us have more work to do. After all, if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves,\" he said.\n\nThe speech, which was attended by First Lady Michelle Obama and daughter Malia, was frequently interrupted by cheers and applause from the audience. When he thanked his family for their support, Obama was visibly emotional, and paused to wipe away tears.\n\nObama also used the speech to warn against a growing partisanship, which he says threatens American democracy, and risks ruining political debate.\n\n\"Increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we accept only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that's out there,\" he said.\n\n\"But without some common baseline of facts; without a willingness to admit new information, and concede that your opponent is making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, we'll keep talking past each other, making common ground and compromise impossible.\"\n\nHe called on Americans to be vigilant about democracy and not to take it for granted. Obama issued a rallying cry to his supporters, saying: \"If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try to talk with one in real life.\"\n\n\"If something needs fixing, then lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself,\" he said. \"Show up. Dive in. Stay at it. Sometimes you'll win. Sometimes you'll lose.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Obama directed his team to craft an address that would feel \"bigger than politics\" and speak to all Americans \u2014 including those who voted for Trump.\n\nHis chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan, started writing it last month while Obama was vacationing in Hawaii.\n\nThe AP reports that former aides, including advisers David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs, were consulted on the speech.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.45731708407402, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 613, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.47966939945, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.2626427406198997, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/06/us-designates-election-infrastructure-as-critical.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [64, 122, 131, 146, 255, 267, 272, 281, 298, 399, 408, 460, 470, 539, 548, 563, 595, 706, 718, 868, 880, 1061, 1177, 1195, 1330, 1526, 1656, 1668, 2170, 2180, 2190, 2210, 2225, 2347, 2368, 2380, 2501, 2563, 2578, 2618, 2627, 2642, 2851, 2860, 2905, 2917, 3026, 3035, 3050, 3099, 3108, 3174, 3616, 3660, 3669, 3784, 3789, 3798, 3865, 3869, 3908, 3923, 3968, 3977, 4010, 4019, 4034, 4045, 4209, 4214, 4223, 4238, 4314, 4550, 4562]}}, "headline": "US designates election infrastructure as 'critical'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 729, "date": "20170107000000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0Citing increasingly sophisticated cyber bad actors and an\u00a0election\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0that's \"vital to our national interests,\" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced Friday that he's\u00a0designating\u00a0U.S.\u00a0election\u00a0systems critical\u00a0infrastructure, a move that provides more federal help for state and local governments to keep their\u00a0election\u00a0systems safe from tampering.\n\n\"Given the vital role\u00a0elections\u00a0play in this country, it is clear that certain systems and assets of\u00a0election\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0meet the definition of critical\u00a0infrastructure, in fact and in law,\" Johnson said in a statement. He added: \"Particularly in these times, this\u00a0designation\u00a0is simply the right and obvious thing to do.\"\n\nThe determination came after months of review and despite opposition from many states worried that the\u00a0designation\u00a0would lead to increased federal regulation or oversight on the many decentralized and locally run voting systems across the country. It was announced on the same day a declassified\u00a0U.S. intelligence report said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"ordered\" an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the\u00a0U.S. presidential\u00a0election.\n\nThe declassified report said that Russian intelligence services had \"obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple\u00a0U.S. state or local electoral boards.\" None of the systems targeted or compromised was involved in vote tallying, the report said.\n\nA 2013 presidential directive identified 16 sectors as critical\u00a0infrastructures, including energy, financial services, health care, transportation, food and agriculture and communications.\n\nThe\u00a0designation\u00a0announced Friday places responsibilities on the Homeland Security secretary to identify and prioritize those sectors, considering physical and cyber threats against them. The secretary is also required to conduct security checks and provide information about emerging and imminent threats.\n\nSuch a change does not require presidential action, and only requires the secretary to first consult with the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism.\n\nDiscussions about whether to\u00a0designate\u00a0elections\u00a0systems as critical\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0surfaced after hackers targeted the voter registration systems of more than 20 states in the months prior to the November\u00a0election.\n\nWhile the\u00a0designation\u00a0puts responsibilities on the Department of Homeland Security, it does not require entities that are determined \"critical\u00a0infrastructure\" to participate. Much of the nation's critical\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0is in the private sector.\n\nJohnson said\u00a0election\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0included storage facilities, polling places and vote tabulation locations, plus technology involved in the process, including voter registration databases, voting machines and other systems used to manage the\u00a0election\u00a0process and report and display results.\n\nThe\u00a0designation\u00a0allows for information to be withheld from the public when state, local and private partners meet to discuss\u00a0election\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0security \u2014 potentially injecting secrecy into an\u00a0election\u00a0process that's traditionally and expressly a transparent process.\u00a0U.S. officials say such closed door conversations allow for frank discussion that would prevent bad actors from learning about vulnerabilities. DHS would also be able to grant security clearances when appropriate and provide more detailed threat information to states.\n\nThe Obama administration has proposed international cyber rules for peacetime that would expressly note that countries shouldn't conduct online activity targeting critical\u00a0infrastructure, which will now also include\u00a0election\u00a0systems.\n\nPresident Barack Obama used sanctions last week to retaliate against Russian efforts to interfere in the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0election\u00a0process by expanding a prior executive order that allows for their\u00a0use\u00a0in the case of cyberattack on critical\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0to entities \"interfering with or undermining\u00a0election\u00a0processes or institutions.\" With\u00a0election\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0designated\u00a0as critical, an attack that takes the system down would also qualify for a response of sanctions.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brian P. Kemp, who is a member of the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0Election\u00a0Infrastructure\u00a0Cybersecurity Working Group run by DHS, is among those who have opposed the\u00a0designation. Testifying in September to a House Oversight subcommittee, Kemp said more federal oversight could make systems more vulnerable and could make protected records more accessible.\n\nWhen Johnson discussed the likelihood of the\u00a0designation\u00a0in a conference call with state officials on Thursday, Kemp called the action \"a federal overreach into a sphere constitutionally reserved for the states.\" According to a copy of his comments released by his office, Kemp told Johnson on the phone that \"this smacks of partisan politics\" given the dwindling days left in the Obama administration.\n\nKemp has appealed to President-elect Donald Trump to investigate \"failed cyberattacks\" on the Georgia secretary of state's network that traced to the Department of Homeland Security, calling the department's technical explanations insufficient.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.65058660507202, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 702, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.12009788859, "HarmVirtue": 12, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170107000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.98860398860399, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/28/church-shooter-dylann-roof-says-wont-call-witnesses-give-evidence-to-spare-life.html": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 558, "scraper_regex": 635}}, "headline": "Church shooter Dylann Roof says he won't call witnesses, give evidence to spare life", "wordcount_as_scraped": 635, "date": "20161228170000", "story_content": "Dylann Roof told a judge Wednesday he did not plan to call any witnesses or present evidence to ask a jury to spare his life after the massacre that left nine black worshippers dead at a South Carolina church in 2015.\n\n\nSUSPECT IN MURDER OF ACTRESS, YOGA TEACHER CHARGED IN 6 OTHER CRIMES IN 2016\n\nHe also was working hard to keep secret potentially embarrassing evidence about himself and his family. Just exactly what that evidence is remains a mystery. Roof, the judge and prosecutors carefully tiptoed around describing it during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nThe judge has indicated that it may be allowed during the penalty phase of the trial, which starts next week.\n\nRoof said he was acting as his own attorney in the penalty phase to prevent what he thought would be further embarrassment to himself or his family. Judge Richard Gergel told Roof at the hearing in Charleston that being his own lawyer was a bad idea.\n\n'BAREFOOT BANDIT' REPORTEDLY FREED FROM WORK-RELEASE PROGRAM\n\n\"I'm not intending to offer any evidence or call any witnesses\n whatsoever,\" Roof told the judge.\n\n\"That's your decision,\" Gergel told Roof. \"I think that highlights my advice to you that you aren't served by being your own counsel.\"\n\nGergel told Roof to talk to his grandfather, who is a lawyer, and other family members one last time. He told Roof he has until the start of the penalty phase Tuesday to change his mind and hire his high-powered, publicly funded defense team back.\n\nThe same jurors who convicted Roof earlier this month on 33 counts including hate crimes and obstruction of religion will return next week to decide if he faces life in prison without parole or the death penalty.\n\nRoof spoke for less than 10 minutes of the 35-minute hearing Wednesday. He told Gergel he does plan an opening and closing statement. He then told the judge he objects to prosecutors' plans to present a photograph of evidence in the court's possession. Roof, Gergel and assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson all carefully tiptoed around saying what that evidence was.\n\nRoof also wanted a jailhouse statement left out of the penalty phase and evidence that involved his mother. He did not give specifics. Gergel told Roof to go back to jail and write a motion for him to consider. Roof's ankle chain clanked as he walked back to the defense table in his jail jumpsuit.\n\nProsecutors also laid out their case. Most of the penalty phase will involve up to 38 people related to the nine people killed and the three people spared when Roof went into Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church on June 17, 2015, sat through a 45-minute Bible study in the fellowship hall, then fired 77 shots as many of the worshippers hid under tables.\n\nGergel, who complained during the guilt phase that prosecutors were repeating themselves at times with witnesses, said he would allow Richardson to call as many witnesses related to the victims as he wants.\n\n\"The statute provides broad leeway for the victims to be heard, and I plan on honoring that,\" the judge said.\n\nRichardson said he also would call the chief FBI agent on the case to tie up loose ends and refresh jurors' memories.\n\nGergel spent much of the hearing going over the format of the penalty phase with Roof, warning him several times he was likely doing himself no favors leaving his defense team as just advisers to file briefs.\n\nAfter saying he planned no witnesses, Roof told Gergel he was just answering the same question the judge had asked prosecutors. Gergel said that wasn't necessary.\n\n\"Don't do them any favors,\" the judge said. \"They aren't going to do you any.\"\n\nFox News Multimedia Reporter Terace Garnier in Charleston and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.635761737823491, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 558, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.1642044068100001, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 3, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161228170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.7921146953404998, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/22/south-korean-court-holds-hearing-on-impeached-president.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [76]}}, "headline": "South Korean court holds hearing on impeached president", "wordcount_as_scraped": 549, "date": "20161222100000", "story_content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2013 \u00a0South Korea's Constitutional Court on Thursday held its first preparatory hearing in the trial of impeached President Park Geun-hye, whom lawmakers voted to remove over an explosive corruption scandal that saw millions of people protest in past weeks.\n\nThe court confirmed it will hear allegations that Park colluded with longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort money and favors from major South Korean companies and allowed Choi to interfere with government affairs from the shadows.\n\nThe court also said it would review accusations in the impeachment bill that Park was responsible for media restrictions and government inaction during a 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people, mostly teenagers on a school trip.\n\nAfter discussions with Park's lawyers and with lawmakers, who are the prosecutors at her impeachment trial, the court decided to summon as witnesses Choi and two former presidential secretaries. Both were arrested earlier for allegedly helping Choi extort from companies and passing her confidential government information.\n\nThe court has up to six months to decide whether Park should permanently step down or be reinstated. Her presidential powers are suspended until then, with the prime minister assuming the role of government caretaker. The next preparatory hearing in Park's trial is scheduled on Dec. 27.\n\nSouth Korea's opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach the president on Dec. 9 as the scandal grew. The investigation has widened with a special prosecutor since Wednesday conducting raids at the offices of the national pension fund and trying to detain Choi's daughter, Yoora Chung, who is believed to be in Germany.\n\nChoi is suspected of exploiting her presidential ties to get Chung, an equestrian athlete, into an elite university despite questionable qualifications. Lee Jae-yong, the scion of Samsung, South Korea's largest business group, has apologized over the use of corporate funds to buy a horse for Chung, but denied that Samsung sought favors from Choi or Park's administration.\n\nAfter a request from the investigators, Seoul's Foreign Ministry said it will soon order Choi's daughter to hand in her passport. It will be invalidated if she does not return it, ministry's spokesman Cho June-hyuck said.\n\nAn official from the investigation team led by special prosecutor Park Young-soo earlier said it had obtained a warrant to detain Chung and had asked for help from German prosecutors in finding Chung and obtaining evidence, such as financial transaction and phone records. A German prosecution official told South Korean media that Germany will cooperate with South Korean investigators.\n\nSamsung is under suspicion that it sponsored Choi in an effort to win government backing for a controversial merger between two affiliates last year that allowed Lee to further promote a father-to-son transfer of leadership and corporate wealth at the group. Lee's father, Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee, has been hospitalized since suffering a heart attack in 2014.\n\nSamsung and other major companies gave a combined 77.4 billion won ($65 million) to two non-profit foundations Choi allegedly controlled and abused to expand her personal wealth.\n\nThe National Pension Service, which was raided Wednesday, supported the merger between the two Samsung affiliates even though the fund's stake in one of the companies lost an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars in value. Investigators also searched an office at the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which governs the pension service.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.55555534362793, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 524, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.67134330099, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.05343511450382, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/01/baltimore-school-bus-commuter-bus-collision-kills-6.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [64, 4770]}}, "headline": "Baltimore school bus, commuter bus collision kills 6", "wordcount_as_scraped": 766, "date": "20161102000000", "story_content": "BALTIMORE \u2013 \u00a0A school bus was blocks away from its first stop Tuesday morning when it hit a cemetery wall, rear-ended a car and then ricocheted off a roadside pillar into an oncoming commuter bus. The pre-dawn accident killed six people and injured 10, authorities said.\n\n\nThere were virtually no skid marks at the crash scene, suggesting no braking by the 67-year-old school bus driver, who was killed, and leading to what Baltimore police spokesman T.J. Smith called a working theory that he had suffered some sort of medical emergency.\n\n\nThe 33-year-old female driver of the Maryland Transit Administration bus also died at the scene, along with four of her 12 passengers, Smith said.\n\n\n\"This was a grueling and gruesome process of removing bodies,\" he said.\n\n\nThe only other occupant of the school bus, an aide, suffered minor injuries, Smith said. The car driver also survived with minor injuries. All eight of the surviving commuter bus riders were hurt, two of them critically, he said.\n\n\nAll the victims were adults. Police have not yet released any of their names, pending notification of relatives.\n\n\nSmith said an autopsy will help determine whether the school bus driver had any medical conditions that could have contributed to the crash.\n\n\nHe said investigators have recovered recording equipment from one of the buses that he believes contains video and possibly data evidence -- if it can be retrieved.\n\n\n\"We have to see the viability of it after this catastrophic accident,\" Smith said.\n\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board investigator Jennifer Morrison said her team has begun looking at the vehicles and crash scene. She said they will likely remain in Baltimore through the week, gathering facts to determine the cause of the crash and make safety recommendations.\n\n\nBaltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said riders on the No. 10 MTA bus were likely going to work on a route from Dundalk, a largely blue-collar community southeast of Baltimore, toward Catonsville, a western suburb.\n\n\n\"They're on their way to make a living, they're on their way to the job, and they're on their way to support their families,\" Davis said, \"Our hearts and prayers go out to them, to their families, to their co-workers as well.\"\n\n\nThe school bus first hit the cemetery wall, then struck a silver Ford Mustang, crushing its rear and forcing its nose into the pavement. Then it hit a pillar at the cemetery entrance hundreds of feet down the street. Veering across the double-yellow center line, the yellow school bus slammed into the front driver side of the MTA bus, ending about 100 yards from the pillar.\n\n\nThe school bus raked the side of the commuter bus, finally stopping with its front end buried in the left rear quarter of the MTA vehicle on Frederick Avenue near Loudon Park Cemetery.\n\n\nThe Mustang driver, Shawn Braxton, said he was driving to work when the bus hit his car. Bystanders helped him get out, he said.\n\nBraxton said he was bruised but also struggling emotionally.\n\n\n\"I'm just mentally trying to deal with, you know, surviving the accident while other people died,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\n\nThe school bus was contracted from Baltimore-based AA Affordable Transportation and served 18 elementary students, the city's public school system said in a statement.\n\n\nFederal records show the company had no violations or other crashes reported in the two years ending this past September. In 2012, an AA Affordable school bus was involved in a crash that injured at least 13 people, including students, when it collided with a minivan, the Baltimore Sun reported.\n\n\nThe company's five-year contract with the school district ends in June 2018, according to online public records.\n\n\nOne of the company's drivers, Chernell Burrows, told reporters that the late driver was kind and dependable.\n\n\n\"I'm so sad,\" Burrows said.\n\n\nSome of the survivors suffered injuries to their faces and spines, said Dr. Deborah Stein at the University of University of Maryland Medical Center's shock trauma unit in Baltimore, where five of the injured were taken. Two were taken to St. Agnes Hospital, according to a statement from St. Agnes Healthcare.\n\n\nThe Rev. Mike Murphy said the crash sounded like \"one loud thump\" from his room in the rectory of nearby St. Joseph's Monastery, a Catholic facility.\n\n\nMurphy said the busy thoroughfare \"gets kind of crazy at times.\"\n\n\nDoreen Downs, who lives nearby, heard the crash and saw the wreckage.\n\n\n\"It's just horrible,\" she said.\n\n\nSmith characterized it as an accident investigation, not a crime-scene investigation, despite the presence of homicide detectives. Smith said they were called because they are accustomed to conducting death investigations.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.875, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 748, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.84981042485, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161102000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6096256684492003, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/05/president-dems-own-obamacare-disaster-despite-lame-talking-points.html": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4740]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 694, "scraper_regex": 769}}, "headline": "President, Dems own ObamaCare disaster despite lame talking points", "wordcount_as_scraped": 769, "date": "20170105190000", "story_content": "A desperate President Obama went to Capitol Hill Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to try and save his disastrous health care law, but all he managed to do was get left-wing lawmakers to back the monumental failure with old, tired and divisive rhetoric.\n\nThey want to scare the American people because Republicans want to repeal and replace ObamaCare. But all they can offer are lame talking points.\n\n\"The Republican plan to cut health care wouldn't make America great again, it would make America sick again,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nDemocrats were so proud of the clever play on Trump's campaign slogan that each one rushed to the podium to repeat it. Over and over.\n\nBut while Democrats were pointing fingers and spouting canned lines, Vice President-elect Mike Pence was meeting with Republicans to formulate a real plan to repeal and replace the disastrous law.\n\n\"The first order of business is to repeal and replace ObamaCare,\" Pence reasoned. \"ObamaCare has failed. And the American people have sent a decisive message to Washington, D.C., that they want ObamaCare to be repealed and replaced with health care reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.\"\n\nRepublicans need to make sure they keep their promises and move quickly to repeal and replace ObamaCare. But they also need to be careful, because Democrats have already shown they are not going to blame themselves when ObamaCare finally dies and crumbles.\n\nPresident-elect Trump warned the GOP in a tweet that, \"Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases, like the 116 percent hike in Arizona Also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web.\"\n\nTrump is 100 percent right. Republicans need to make President Obama and the Democrats own every lie they told, every failed promise they didn't keep. And there were a bunch of them.\n\n\"No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people. If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period,\" Obama said on June 15, 2009. \"If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan, period.\"\n\nTwo months later, he said, \"If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.\"\n\nObama promised that the average family would save $2,500 per year. Well, since 2009, the average American family is paying $4,100 more for health care.\n\nWe also know that millions of Americans lost their doctors and their plans or both. And that is just the start of this ObamaCare disaster.\n\nHere's what the president and Democrats own, because remember, not a single Republican voted for this law: ObamaCare premiums this year along are increasing by 25 percent on average. Premiums on average for a family of four making $60,000 a year will spike by 43.6 percent. Deductibles for the same group are exploding by 22.9 percent.\n\nThe misery doesn't end there. The president promised free-market competition and choices for Americans on the exchanges, but the opposite has happened. Major insurers like Humana, Aetna, United Healthcare and Blue Cross Blue Shield are all pulling out of states because they are losing money on the exchanges. Humana alone lost over $1 billion just for participating in ObamaCare. In states like Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming, people have only one insurer to choose from now.\n\nAnd then there's all the taxes. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation has previously found that the middle class will face $377 billion in tax increases, courtesy of ObamaCare. According to a recent study, the surging ObamaCare premiums will cost American taxpayers an extra $9.8 billion this year alone.\n\nThe negative impact of ObamaCare is obvious, and it helped propel President-elect Trump to victory. Sure, there are certain aspects of the law that Republicans will keep, like coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parents' plan until age 26. But ObamaCare itself is a single, fundamental, massive big government failure that needs to be completely scrapped and redone. American consumers deserve better care, free-market competition and lower costs.\n\nAdapted from Sean Hannity's monologue on Jan. 4, 2017 airing of \"Hannity.\"\n\n\n\nSean Hannity currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) Hannity (weekdays 10-11PM/ET).

Only 8.3 percent of faculty members signed the letter.\n\nGiven that 82 percent of law professors identified themselves as Democrats in 2010, one can infer that only about 10 percent of Democrat professors signed the letter.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2002, over 23 percent of law professors at the top 20 law schools contributed at least $200 exclusively or mostly to Democrats. By contrast, just 4 percent of law professors were active Republican donors. Assuming that over 23 percent figure has held true today (and given the inordinate hatred for Trump, this might be an underestimate), just a third of active donors to Democrats signed the letter.\n\nThe letter itself is written vaguely to maximize signatures. There is a regurgitation of charges made in 1986 that Sessions was \"prejudice[d] against African Americans.\" It continues: \"Some of us have concerns about \u2026 his consistent promotion of the myth of voter-impersonation fraud ... his support for building a wall along our country's southern border \u2026 his robust support for regressive drug policies that have fueled mass incarceration \u2026 his repeated opposition to legislative efforts to promote the rights of women and the members of the LGBTQ community.\"\n\nThe faculty members could disagree with all of these points and still be able to sign the letter. Indeed, it is hard to find any other letter signed by academics (and there are a lot of them) that offers so many escape clauses for signers. But the goal was to get signatures, not to provide a coherent argument against Sessions.\n\nThe charges themselves are absurd.\n\nTake their first claim. Only liberal academics would believe that \"voter-impersonation fraud\" is a myth.\n\nA recent study in the peer-reviewed journal Electoral Studies estimated that illegal aliens cast about 1.4 million votes in the 2008 and 2010 elections, and that their votes \"likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress.\"\n\nHere are some cases of suspected impersonation fraud discovered during just the month-and-a-half prior to the November election:\n\n\u2022\u00a0San Pedro, Calif.:\u00a083 absentee ballots\u00a0were sent to different registered voters who all supposedly lived in the same small, two-bedroom apartment. If not for an observant neighbor, this case would never have been discovered.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Pennsylvania: Democrat organization FieldWorks LLC was\u00a0raided by Pennsylvania State Police\u00a0on allegations that it fraudulently filled out registration forms for\u00a0thousands\u00a0of voters.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Indiana: State police\u00a0\"believe there could be hundreds of fraudulent voter\u00a0registration records with different combinations of made up names and addresses with people's real information.\"\n\n\u2022\u00a0Chicago: An investigation by CBS-2 found that \"119 dead people have voted a total of 229 times in Chicago in the last decade.\"\n\n\u2022\u00a0Virginia: After examining just eight of the state's 133 counties,\u00a01,046 illegal aliens\u00a0were discovered to already be registered voters.\n\n\u2022\u00a0New York City: In an undercover video, Democrats themselves were caught complaining about the amount of voter fraud created by Mayor Bill de Blasio's decision to\u00a0give out ID cards without checking recipients' identities.\n\nThe law professors' second claim doesn't cite any specific concerns about the wall along the Mexican border. So there is nothing to respond to.\n\nTheir third claim blames drug crimes for mass incarceration. But in 2012, only 20 percent of inmates at state and federal prisons were incarcerated for possessing or trafficking any type of illegal drugs \u2014 and those sentences were primarily for trafficking hard drugs. Data from Arizona indicate that as few as 0.3 percent of inmates were incarcerated for marijuana possession, and these are rare individuals who have been arrested multiple times. In California, only 1 percent of state prisoners are incarcerated for any type of marijuana-related offense.\n\nThe fourth claim doesn't mention any specific things that Sessions has done to harm women or others.\u00a0 But presumably it focuses what was raised during the hearings, Sessions' vote against the Violence Against Women Act.\u00a0 But neither law professors nor his opponents during the hearings over the last two days have seriously addressed Sessions explanation for his vote.\u00a0 Sessions had previously supported the Act, but opposed its renewal in 2012 over concerns that it was unconstitutional when changes were made expanding Indian tribes' jurisdiction over non-tribal members.\u00a0 Tribal courts also have a history of failing to provide adequate legal protections to defendants.\u00a0 No evidence was ever provided that prosecuting non-tribal members in US courts posed any problems to protecting Indians.\n\nAcademics keep making fools of themselves with letters like this, which have everything to do with not wanting a Republican attorney general who supports policies they disagree with. Their letter has nothing to do with Sessions' ability to uphold the law in good faith.\u00a0\n\n\n\nJohn R. Lott, Jr. is a columnist for\u00a0FoxNews.com.

Since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012, reformist magazines and websites have been shut while university professors and even the country's judiciary have been warned against spreading liberal Western values.\n\nMao Yushi, Unirule's founder who is not related to Mao Zedong, said Wednesday that representatives from the ruling Communist Party informed him last week that the website was shut down because it violated the law, but gave no details.\n\n\"It's a terrible thing, it existed for many years,\" Mao told The Associated Press. \"I told (the officials) this is not the law, and they had no response because they won't answer these questions.\"\n\nThe Beijing branch of the Cyberspace Administration of China said this week it closed 17 websites, including that of Unirule, as part of a cleanup of websites providing unauthorized news and pornography.\n\nUnirule and Mao Yushi are particularly reviled by China's increasingly vocal \"leftists\" who see their support of free-market economics as antithetical to Mao Zedong's revolutionary legacy and traditional Communist Party ideology. In recent weeks, Maoists have organized online campaigns and street demonstrations to target a succession of liberal academics, with the apparent support from Chinese authorities who typically break up most forms of unauthorized political activity.\n\nThe party's nationalistic Global Times tabloid, which reported Wednesday on the phenomenon of the growing Maoist movement, opined in a separate piece this week that Mao Yushi's silencing should serve as a lesson.\n\n\"Liberals absolutely must learn this lesson: openly being an oppositional speaker or denier will get you nowhere in China,\" said the op-ed, which was later removed from the paper's website. \"Taking ideas from the West, and trying to pass them off as genuine, will eventually hit a wall.\"\n\nSince 2010, Mao has been under an undeclared overseas travel ban, one of the Chinese government's frequently utilized methods of silencing and punishing its critics. He was prevented that year from going to Oslo to attend the ceremony awarding imprisoned Chinese dissident writer Liu Xiaobo the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nTwo years later, he was awarded the Milton Friedman Prize by the libertarian Cato Institute, but was again banned from traveling to Washington, D.C. to accept the award. Unirule's website was also temporarily taken down by authorities at the time.\n\nIn recent years, Mao has openly questioned whether the Xi administration has reversed course on decades of Chinese economic reform in favor of companies and entire industries under state control. He has also warned about the revival of a militant neo-Maoist movement reminiscent of the political violence and extreme xenophobia of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when fanatical Mao loyalists targeted ideological opponents and neighbors and relatives turned against each other to survive.\n\nIn June last year, the 88-year old economist detailed to The Associated Press the abuse he suffered during the Cultural Revolution, when a gang of young Mao loyalists lashed his father and him with copper-flecked whips.\n\nHis public remarks and incessant blogging have attracted protesters to his public events and threats against his safety at home.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.764976978302, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 589, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.33773813649, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "foxnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.9235993208828495, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}}
