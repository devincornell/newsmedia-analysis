The plane was carrying members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, often referred to as the Red Army Choir, to a New Year\u2019s concert at a Russian military base in Syria. Nine Russian journalists and a Russian doctor known for her charity work in war zones were also on board.\n\nDespite the Syrian connection, Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov, who oversaw rescue efforts, said the government said it sees no need to heighten security measures at Russian airports. \u00a0\n\nAbout 3,500 people, 43 ships and 182 divers have been sweeping a vast crash site for bodies of the victims and debris, and dozens of drones and several submersibles also have been involved in the search. Rescue teams so far have recovered 11 bodies and numerous body fragments, which have been flown to Moscow for identification.\u00a0\n\nDivers have located parts of the plane\u2019s fuselage and other fragments, but the search for the jet\u2019s flight recorders will likely prove challenging as they lack underwater locator beacons for easy spotting common in more modern planes. Russia asked the authorities of Georgia\u2019s breakaway republic of Abkhazia, which borders Russia just 4.3 miles east of the Sochi airport, to help monitor the Black Sea area for possible plane fragments or bodies. \u00a0\n\nOfficials sought to squelch speculation that the crash might have been caused by a bomb planted on board or a portable air defense missile.\u00a0\n\nBut some aviation experts pointed that the crew\u2019s failure to communicate any technical problem and a large area over which fragments of the plane were scattered point at a possible explosion on board.\n\nEvidence of a bombing of a Syria-bound military flight would badly embarrass the Kremlin, highlighting Russia\u2019s extreme vulnerability to attacks even as it boasts its success in Syria after Aleppo fell into President Bashar Assad\u2019s hands. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that an attack isn\u2019t a likely scenario. Sokolov said investigators were looking into a possible technical fault or pilot error as the most likely reasons behind the crash. \n\nBut some experts remained skeptical, noting that the crew would have reported any technical glitch. \u201cPossible malfunctions ... certainly wouldn\u2019t have prevented the crew from reporting them,\u201d Vitaly Andreyev, a former senior Russian air traffic controller, told RIA Novosti, adding that an \u201cexternal impact\u201d was the most likely reason.\n\nRussia\u2019s main domestic security and counter-terrorism agency, the FSB, said it has found \u201cno indications or facts pointing at the possibility of a terror attack or an act of sabotage on board the plane.\u201d The plane departed from the Chkalovsky military airport just outside Moscow and stopped in Sochi for refueling early Sunday. The FSB said border guards and military servicemen were protecting the plane as it sat on the tarmac in Sochi, and the chief pilot along with the flight engineer personally monitored the refueling. The agency said that a border guard officer and a customs official were the only ones to briefly come on board in Sochi. Some Russian media pointed at lax security at Chkalovsky outside Moscow where the plane was based, saying that it\u2019s quite porous compared to civilian airports. Alexander Gusak, a former chief of the FSB special forces unit, also hinted at security breaches at Chkalovsky and said that even a much more secure Sochi airport could be vulnerable. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to penetrate any facility. It depends on your skills,\u201d Gusak told Dozhd TV. Russian planes have been downed previously in attacks -- as recently as 2015. In October last year, a Russian passenger plane was brought down by a bomb over Egypt, killing all 224 people aboard. Officials said the explosive device was planted in the plane\u2019s luggage compartment. A local affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed responsibility. In August 2004, two Russian planes were blown up on the same day by suicide bombers, killing 89 people. A Chechen warlord claimed responsibility for the twin attacks, which were made possible by lax security at a Moscow airport. While ruling out an attack in Sunday\u2019s crash, the FSB said that investigators are looking into bad fuel, pilot error, alien objects stuck in the engines or equipment failure. John Goglia, a former U.S. National Transportation Safety Board member and aviation safety expert, argued that while pilot error or bad fuel \u201cwould be high on my list,\u201d they wouldn\u2019t have prevented the pilot from alerting traffic controllers to the situation. He also noted that the Tu-154 has been \u201ca pretty reliable platform.\u201d The Tu-154 is a Soviet-built three-engine airliner designed in the late 1960s. More than 1,000 have been built, and they have been used extensively in Russia and worldwide. The plane that crashed Sunday was built in 1983, and underwent factory check-ups and maintenance in 2014 as well as earlier this year.\u00a0\n\nWhile the Tu-154 is no longer used by Russian airlines because it\u2019s too noisy and fuel-hungry, the Russian military has continued to operate it. The plane has been popular with crews who appreciate its maneuverability and ruggedness. Flags were at half-staff across Russia on Monday, nationwide television stations canceled their entertainment programs and the Cabinet began its session with a moment of silence as part of the nationwide mourning. People piled up red and white carnations outside the Moscow office of the Alexandrov Ensemble, popular across the world for its fiery performances. Vadim Ananyev, a soloist who stayed home with his family, said he was devastated. \u201cI have lost my friends and colleagues, all killed, all five soloists,\u201d Ananyev told The Associated Press. \u201cI have known these people for 30 years. I know their wives and children. I feel terrible for the children and for all that I have lost.\u201d Ananyev said he had received condolences from all over Russia and from abroad. \u201cWe were loved all over the world, never mind the political situation,\u201d he said. In Rome, Pope Francis led thousands of faithful in silent prayer for the plane crash victims and noted that the Russian army choir had performed in 2004 at the Vatican.\n\n\u201cMay the Lord console the dear Russian people and the families of the passengers who were on board: journalists, crew and the excellent choir and orchestra of the armed forces,\u201d the pope said, reports Vatican Radio. \u201cMay the blessed Virgin Mary sustain the search operations underway.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.22535228729248, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 588, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.3787046261899998, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161226090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.04081632653061, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/usc-stabbing-kills-psychology-professor-student-arrested/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [109, 249]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 526, "scraper_regex": 583}}, "headline": "USC stabbing kills psychology professor; student arrested", "wordcount_as_scraped": 583, "date": "20161203150000", "story_content": "Last Updated Dec 3, 2016 8:50 PM EST\n\nLOS ANGELES --\u00a0Police have identified the student they believe was responsible for stabbing a professor to death at the University of Southern California.\u00a0\n\nLos Angeles police say 28-year-old David Jonathan Brown of Los Angeles was booked on a charge of murder in the death of Bosco Tjan, a psychology professor and neuroscientist. Brown, who was arrested shortly after the stabbing, was being held on $1 million bail.\n\nThough details of the motive weren\u2019t released, Los Angeles Police Officer Meghan Aguilar said Tjan was specifically targeted and that the attack wasn\u2019t random.\n\nA David Brown is listed as a graduate student in psychology on USC\u2019s website. Tjan oversaw graduate students in the department and was killed in the building that houses the lab he ran.\n\nAguilar said Tjan was killed inside the Seeley G. Mudd building in the heart of campus. Aguilar could not say who called police but said it wasn\u2019t the professor or the student.\n\nThe victim\u2019s age was originally reported as 25. Later, police said they could not immediately confirm the man\u2019s age, CBS Los Angeles reports. Public records list Tjan\u2019s age as 50.\n\nTjan joined USC in 2001, taught in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and served as co-director of the Dornsife Cognitive Neuroimaging Center, USC President C. L. Max Nikias said in a letter addressed to the USC community.\n\n\u201cAs the Trojan family mourns Professor Tjan\u2019s untimely passing, we will keep his family in our thoughts,\u201d Nikias said.\n\nThe USC Department of Public Safety said in a statement that investigators believe the attack \u201cwas the result of a personal dispute.\u201d\n\nChris Purington, project manager at Tjan\u2019s lab, said he never heard of anyone having a problem with Tjan - a married father of one son - and had no idea who would have wanted him dead.\n\n\u201cHe was somebody who really cared about people. I know he cared about me,\u201d Purington said through tears. \u201cHe mentored people and he looked out for them. He spent a lot of time thinking about what it means to be a mentor and guide people.\u201d\n\nHe said the professor gave him a job both after he graduated from USC and after graduate school at the University of California-Berkeley.\n\nPurington traveled with Tjan for various science conferences and said that everyone knew and loved the professor.\n\n\u201cPeople talk about scientists as very cold or robotic. Bosco is a guy that he could talk to anybody about anything,\u201d he said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t move through a room without being sidetracked in all these conversations.\n\n\u201cHe just had this energy about him. Kinetic might be the word,\u201d Purington said. \u201cHe had a huge impact on my life.\u201d\n\nUSC was rocked last year by the beating death of graduate student Xinran Ji, who was attacked and beaten by several people as he walked back to his off-campus apartment late at night after attending a study session.\n\nAfter Ji\u2019s murder USC officials sought to reassure parents of Chinese exchange students that the campus and its surrounding areas are safe.\n\nIn 2012, Chinese graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu were shot to death as they sat in their BMW about a mile from campus.\n\nUSC has 44,000 students enrolled, including more than 10,000 international students.

While their plans offer relief on a number of fronts, including maternity leave and reducing the cost of child care, the differences in how each would affect a typical American family are startling, according to new research from Care.com. \n\nA typical family would save $4,241 per child on child-care center costs under Clinton\u2019s plan, while Trump\u2019s plan would offer a savings of $1,435. The gap grows wider when considering in-home care, such as hiring a nanny. Here\u2019s where Clinton provides $23,006 in savings, while Trump offers $1,435, the Care.com study found.\n\nWhen it comes to maternity leave, under Trump\u2019s plan new moms would receive six weeks of paid maternity leave after the birth or adoption of a child, with the mother receiving the same income she would collect in unemployment benefits had she been fired, the report noted. Under Clinton\u2019s plan, new mothers and fathers would receive 12 weeks of paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child, at a rate of two-thirds their regular salary. \n\nBecause Trump\u2019s plan is tied to unemployment benefits, it\u2019s unlikely that middle- or upper-income mothers would receive anywhere near their full salaries during those six weeks of paid leave. Unemployment benefits, which are set by each state, range from a low of $240 per week in Arizona to about $700 in Massachusetts. The median weekly pay in the U.S. is $827, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n\nTrump\u2019s child care plan would benefit the richest American families, those in the top 1 percent of earners. These families, who make more than $389,000 annually, would save $3,164 per year on both in-center and at-home child care, or more than double the savings provided to median-income families, the report found. \n\nStill, Care.com said it couldn\u2019t say which plan is more family friendly, because of the complexity of each family\u2019s individual situation.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhether a family will save more under Trump\u2019s plan or Clinton\u2019s plan will depend on a number of variables, including their household income, the number of children, age of their children and employment status of the parents, so it\u2019s difficult to make a straight comparison between the two plans,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nAmericans are increasingly scrambling to find affordable quality child care, thanks to the rising costs of day care centers and nursery schools as well as household income that still hasn\u2019t recovered to its prerecession level. The U.S. has taken a market approach to the issue, unlike K-12 education, which is largely funded by taxpayers. \n\nThat not only places a financial strain on families until their children are old enough to enroll in kindergarten, but it may be creating an education gap between poor American kids and wealthier families who can afford quality care. Children from less well-off families are entering kindergarten with lagging \u201cnon-cognitive\u201d skills, such as self-control, and academic ability,\u00a0a study from the Economic Policy Institute found last year.\n\nWhat about the costs of Trump\u2019s plan versus Clinton\u2019s? Clinton would use tax increases on the rich to help pay for family leave, while Trump would rely on unemployment insurance to cover mothers\u2019 six weeks of pay. Because of \u201climited details,\u201d it\u2019s difficult to say exactly how much taxpayers might shoulder to cover either plan, according to Child Care Aware.\n\nIt might be hard to stomach higher taxes to pay for child care benefits, but it\u2019s one area that has a high return on investment. The EPI noted that investing in early childhood education helps create a better-educated workforce. It would also help more parents remain in the labor market, rather than scaling back or leaving their job to become full-time parents.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.47846889495849604, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 564, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.61579825872, "HarmVirtue": 18, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161103100000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.673758865248231, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/groups-ask-court-keep-blocking-law-allowing-denial-services-same-sex-couples/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1550]}}, "headline": "Groups ask court to keep blocking law allowing denial of services to same-sex couples", "wordcount_as_scraped": 529, "date": "20161219020000", "story_content": "JACKSON, Miss. -- Gay rights groups and others are asking a federal appeals court to keep blocking a Mississippi law that would let merchants and government employees cite religious beliefs to deny services to same-sex couples. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves halted the law before it could take effect July 1, ruling it unconstitutionally establishes preferred beliefs and creates unequal treatment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The law championed and signed by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant sought to protect three beliefs: marriage is only between a man and a woman; sex should only take place in such a marriage; and a person\u2019s gender is determined at birth and cannot be altered. Bryant filed papers in late October asking the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to lift the hold to let the law take effect. Gay and straight plaintiffs who sued the state filed written arguments Friday with the 5th Circuit, saying the law \u201cacts as an unconstitutional religious \u2018gerrymander\u2019 by putting its thumb on the scales to give special protections to one side in that religious debate and not the other.\u201d The law -- which started as House Bill 1523 -- would have allowed clerks to cite religious objections to recuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and would have protected merchants who refuse services to LGBT people. It could have affected adoptions and foster care, business practices and school bathroom policies.\u00a0\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 appeal gives examples of what the law could allow: A restaurant manager refusing to seat a lesbian couple celebrating an anniversary dinner; a jewelry store clerk refusing to sell an engagement ring to straight couple if he believed the couple had previously had sex; social workers being unable to protect a child whose foster parents punished the child for being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender; public school counselors refusing to help LGBT students. \u201cThis provision of HB 1523 is arguably the most alarming since it would allow a school psychologist or guidance counselor to cease therapy with a depressed, suicidal high school student who divulges to the counselor that he thinks he might be gay,\u201d says the appeal filed by attorney Roberta Kaplan. More than 100 bills were filed in more than 20 state legislatures across the nation in response to the June 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage, UCLA law professor Douglas NeJaime testified in June during a federal district court hearing on the Mississippi law. NeJaime said Mississippi was the only state to enact a law listing specific beliefs to be protected. The Mississippi law was supported by Baptist and Pentecostal groups, and the Washington-based Family Research Council gave Bryant an award for signing it. Opponents protested outside the Governor\u2019s Mansion in Jackson and executives of several large companies, including Coca-Cola Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp., called the law as discriminatory and said legislators should repeal it. Multiple lawsuits from gay rights supporters sought to overturn the law. Mississippi Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood declined to appeal Reeves\u2019 ruling. The governor\u2019s appeal is being handled by private attorneys, including some working for Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based Christian legal group that helped to write the law.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.724637687206268, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 505, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 16, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.6086515838699995, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161219020000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 6.13861386138614, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/steven-frederick-spears-georgia-death-row-inmate-scheduled-for-execution-wednesday/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4859]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 771, "scraper_regex": 812}}, "headline": "Ga. death row inmate says he won't fight execution scheduled for Wed.", "wordcount_as_scraped": 812, "date": "20161116230000", "story_content": "ATLANTA -- A Georgia death-row inmate scheduled for execution Wednesday said he doesn\u2019t really want to die but doesn\u2019t want to fight it because he also doesn\u2019t want to continue living in prison, according to a psychiatric evaluation report. Steven Frederick Spears does not meet any criteria for mental illness and has the capacity to make a rational choice to decline to pursue legal challenges, Dr. Matthew Norman, an expert selected by the state, wrote after evaluating Spears on Tuesday. Lawyer Brian Kammer, executive director of the Georgia Resource Center, which works on behalf of death-row inmates, said at a hearing Wednesday that state attorneys had assured him if Spears changes his mind, the execution will be halted and Spears will be allowed to contact lawyers who will initiate post-conviction proceedings. Spears, 54, was convicted in the August 2001 slaying of his ex-girlfriend, Sherri Holland, at her home in Dahlonega, about 65 miles northeast of Atlanta. A Georgia Supreme Court summary of the case says Spears killed Holland because he suspected she had been romantically involved with someone else. Spears came up with four separate plans for her death and ultimately killed her by choking her, wrapping tape around her mouth and face and putting a plastic bag over her head, the summary says. Spears was difficult to defend at trial, refusing to let his attorneys delve into his troubled family history or to suggest he wasn\u2019t of sound mind, his trial attorney Allyn Stockton told The Associated Press last week. He also refused to allow them to pursue any post-conviction appeals and has refused to communicate with Stockton for more than a year. Kammer filed a petition Monday saying Spears\u2019 constitutional rights were violated during his trial, sentencing and direct appeal and asking a judge to delay his execution to set a hearing on those issues. The \u201cnext friend\u201d petition was filed on behalf of Gwen Thompson, who was identified in the filing as Spears\u2019 ex-wife and the mother of his child. Such a petition is available to someone who has a significant relationship with a death-row inmate who declines to appeal their sentence \u201cdue to a mental disease or defect.\u201d Spears told Butts County Superior Court Judge Thomas Wilson during a hearing Tuesday that he and Thompson were never married and also said he didn\u2019t want to talk to Kammer and that Kammer didn\u2019t represent him, according to a transcript of the hearing. He told the judge it is his right not to pursue post-conviction appeals and that lawyers who are trying to fight his execution now are \u201ctrying to force their beliefs on me.\u201d Robert Shaffer, an expert selected by Kammer, also evaluated Spears on Tuesday and said he didn\u2019t find sufficient evidence of substantial impairment to Spears\u2019 capacity to make a rational choice regarding legal challenges. Given the findings of both experts, Kammer asked the judge at a hearing Wednesday to dismiss the petition and said lawyers would be standing by Wednesday evening with paperwork for Spears to sign if he changes his mind, according to a transcript. \u201cMr. Spears, there are people in your life who care about you. They want you in their life. They love you. Please don\u2019t let it end this way, sir. Please reconsider,\u201d Kammer told Spears in court, according to the transcript. When asked during the evaluation by Norman if he wanted to die, Spears said, \u201cNot really, but would you want to live in a six by nine cell. That\u2019s not living,\u201d according to the psychiatric evaluation report. When Norman asked about his refusal to pursue post-conviction appeals, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about another ten to fifteen years. I\u2019m not doing that. The process takes so long. It\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with the death penalty. I have another twenty years of appeals,\u201d he said, adding that even if the court were to grant him life with parole it would take a long time and there\u2019s no assurance he\u2019d actually get out of prison. About 10 percent of executions are imposed on inmates who have voluntarily waived their appellate rights, though Spears would be the first such case in Georgia, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit critical of capital punishment\u2019s application that does not take an official stance on it. \u201cThese executions are always problematic because they are cases in which there has not been complete judicial review,\u201d Dunham said, adding that the types of errors that typically result in a death sentence being overturned frequently are unearthed in post-conviction proceedings when a new team of lawyers digs into the case. The State Board of Pardons and Paroles, the only authority in Georgia with the power to commute a death sentence, on Wednesday announced its decision not to spare Spears\u2019 life.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.91017961502075, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 771, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.90692517849, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161116230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 2.8534370946822296, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctors-without-borders-hospitals-airstrikes-syria-aleppo/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Doctors Without Borders hospitals hit by airstrikes in Syria's Aleppo", "wordcount_as_scraped": 758, "date": "20161117190000", "story_content": "BEIRUT -- Airstrikes pounded rebel-held eastern Aleppo on Thursday, killing more than 20 people and hitting a water pumping station on the third day of a renewed air campaign on the besieged territory, Syrian activists and rescue workers said.\n\nThe Russian military meanwhile said airstrikes in the rebel-held province of Idlib earlier this week killed at least 30 members of an al Qaeda-linked group, including three commanders. The strikes are part of a major Syrian and Russian offensive launched earlier this week on opposition-held areas that has killed dozens of people.\n\nIn one area, volunteer first responders dug through the rubble for four hours before pulling out a 6-year-old child who was still alive. The child\u2019s mother was killed in the strikes, said Ibrahim al-Haj, a spokesman for the rescuers, known as the Syrian Civil Defense.\n\nThe activist-run Public Services Authority said the Bab al-Nairab water plant was struck with a barrel bomb.

Medical facilities have repeatedly come under attack during the Syrian conflict, with 126 such incidents this year alone, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said the children\u2019s hospital and a specialized surgical hospital were hit by Wednesday\u2019s strikes.\n\n\u201cHospital staff managed to move children - including prematurely born babies - from cots and incubators to the basement of the building in order to shelter them from the bombing,\u201d said the aid group, which sponsors both hospitals.\n\nThe Oxfam aid group said the more than 250,000 residents of eastern Aleppo have limited food and clean water as winter approaches, and are at risk of disease outbreaks.\n\nNo U.N. aid has reached eastern Aleppo since July, and the U.N. has warned that supplies will run out this week. Oxfam said it helped move a generator to the besieged area on Wednesday to improve the water supply.\n\n\u201cClean water is vital, but it won\u2019t stop starvation, never mind protect people from indiscriminate aerial attacks,\u201d said Andy Baker, who is leading Oxfam\u2019s Syria response.\n\nThe Syrian Civil Defense said 28 people were killed in and around Aleppo on Thursday. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of local activists, put the death toll at 25.\n\nAt least 70 people were killed in northern Syria on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nRussia says it is not bombing Aleppo as part of the offensive announced this week, but is instead targeting insurgents in Idlib and the central Homs province.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the strikes targeting al Qaeda took place in Idlib on Tuesday, and were launched from Russia\u2019s only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, which recently deployed to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHe said three leading members of the al Qaeda-linked Fatah al-Sham Front - Muhammad Helala, Abu Jaber Harmuja and Abul Baha al-Asfari - were among those killed. He said al-Asfari had overseen the group\u2019s attempts to break the siege of Aleppo.\n\nAl-Asfari had led a moderate rebel group in 2013, and it was not clear if or when he joined the al Qaeda-linked group.\n\nAn opposition media group known as All4Syria reported that the two other named militants were killed Tuesday in an airstrike in the village of Kfar Jalis, in the Idlib countryside, that also killed six civilians. The Observatory\u2019s chief Rami Abdurrahman said the airstrike on the jihadi stronghold killed six leading militants, without identifying them.\n\nThe same village was struck Thursday, the Observatory said, killing six civilians from the same family.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said long-range bombers dispatched from Russia fired cruise missiles at Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and al Qaeda targets in Syria during a 7,000-mile flight. It said fighter jets from the carrier and an air base in Syria also took part in the strikes. It did not say where the strikes took place, but said they destroyed command facilities, ammunition depots and weapons factories.\n\nMonths of negotiations between the U.S. and Russia failed to cement a long-term cease-fire in Aleppo, which has become the focus of the war between Syrian President Bashar Assad and rebels fighting to topple him.\n\nAl Qaeda\u2019s Syrian affiliate is fighting alongside the rebels, but ISIS has no presence in Aleppo.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.9056601524353, "HarmVice": 18, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 726, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.99255644282, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161117190000, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 5.64738292011019, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/probe-780-million-painkillers-in-6-years-west-virginia/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4986]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 981, "scraper_regex": 1042}}, "headline": "Probe reveals flood of 780M painkillers in 6 deadly years in West Virginia", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1042, "date": "20161220170000", "story_content": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. - Drug wholesalers shipped 780 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills to West Virginia in just six years, a period when 1,728 people fatally overdosed on these two painkillers, according to an investigation by the Charleston Gazette-Mail.\n\nThat amounts to 433 of the frequently abused opioid pills for every man, woman and child in the state of 1.84 million people.\n\nThe Gazette-Mail obtained previously confidential records sent by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to the office of West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. They disclose the number of pills sold to every pharmacy and drug shipments to all 55 counties in West Virginia between 2007 and 2012.\n\nFour of these counties - Wyoming, McDowell, Boone and Mingo - lead the nation in fatal overdoses caused by pain pills, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe records - which leading drug wholesalers had fought in court to keep secret - show the wholesalers shipped ever-higher doses of the pills - a telltale sign of growing addictions - even as the death toll climbed, the newspaper reported on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThese numbers will shake even the most cynical observer,\u201d former Delegate Don Perdue, D-Wayne, a retired pharmacist who finished his term earlier this month, told the newspaper. \u201cDistributors have fed their greed on human frailties and to criminal effect. There is no excuse and should be no forgiveness.\u201d\n\nMcKesson Corp., Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Drug Co. together control about 85 percent of the U.S. drug distribution market by revenue and provided more pills to West Virginia than other wholesalers.\n\nAs hydrocodone and oxycodone overdose deaths increased 67 percent in West Virginia between 2007 and 2012, their chief executives were paid millions and their companies made billions. McKesson became America\u2019s fifth-largest corporation, with the nation\u2019s highest-paid CEO in 2012, according to Forbes.\n\nThe drug distributors say they\u2019re just middlemen in a highly regulated industry and that pills would never get in the hands of addicts and dealers if not for unscrupulous doctors who write illegal prescriptions, and pharmacists who turn a blind eye.\n\n\u201cThe two roles that interface directly with the patient - the doctors who write the prescriptions and the pharmacists who fill them - are in a better position to identify and prevent the abuse and diversion of potentially addictive controlled substance,\u201d McKesson General Counsel John Saia wrote in a letter released by the company, the newspaper reported.\n\nBut the doctors and pharmacists weren\u2019t slowing the influx, and the pills being shipped became much more potent, DEA records show.\n\n\u201cIt starts with the doctor writing, the pharmacist filling and the wholesaler distributing. They\u2019re all three in bed together,\u201d said Sam Suppa, a retired Charleston pharmacist who spent 60 years working at retail pharmacies in West Virginia. \u201cThe distributors knew what was going on. They just didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe largest shipments often went to independent drugstores in small towns. The Tug Valley Pharmacy in Mingo County, which had fewer than 24,000 people in 2010, ordered more than 3 million hydrocodone pills in 2009, while franchisees of Rite Aid and Wal-Mart ordered only several thousand each year, the newspaper reported.\n\nMorrisey is a Republican who represented Cardinal Health and lobbied for wholesalers in Washington, D.C., before winning the attorney general\u2019s race with strong backing from drug companies. He recused himself from the state\u2019s lawsuit against more than a dozen wholesalers after taking office in 2013. In January, Morrisey\u2019s office sued McKesson separately. Nine smaller wholesalers have settled for more than $7.5 million. Cases against the big three remain pending.\n\nDEA agent Kyle Wright warned Morrisey aides in January 2015 that the wholesalers were shipping both opioids in more potent, commonly abused dosages, according to emails Morrisey released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from the Gazette-Mail.\n\nMcKesson denied paying these incentives. A spokesman for AmerisourceBergen suggested health experts and law enforcement would be better able to comment on whether there\u2019s a link between pain-pill volumes and overdose deaths.\n\n\u201cAll parties including pharmacies, doctors, hospitals, manufacturers, patients and state officials share the responsibility to fight opioid abuse,\u201d said Ellen Barry, a spokeswoman for Cardinal Health.\n\nCardinal told The Associated Press on Monday that it now has \u201crigorous control processes in place to address the constantly changing tactics\u201d of people trying to divert drugs.\n\nThe newspaper interviewed the family of Mary Kathryn Mullins, who was prescribed OxyContin for pain in her back after a car crash near her home in Boone County.\n\n\u201cThey wrote her the pain pills, and she just got hooked,\u201d said her mother, Kay Mullins.\u00a0 \u201cShe\u2019d get 90 or 120 pills and finish them off in a week.\u201d\n\nAs her addiction worsened, she went to dozens of doctors, visiting pain clinics that churned out illegal prescriptions by the hundreds and pharmacies that dispensed doses by the millions. She kept most for herself, but sold some to others, Kay Mullins said.\n\nLast December, she got a new prescription for OxyContin and an anti-anxiety medication. Two days later, she stopped breathing. Her brother Nick Mullins, a Madison police officer, responded to the 911 call. He tried chest compressions, but he could not revive his sister. .\n\nMeanwhile, the Gazette-Mail reported on Monday, they disregarded rules to report suspicious orders for controlled substances in West Virginia to the state Board of Pharmacy. And the board, in turn, failed to enforce the same regulations, even as it approved spotless inspection reviews to small-town pharmacies ordering more pills than could possibly be taken by people who really needed medicine to manage pain.\n\nOnly after Morrisey\u2019s predecessor as attorney general sued wholesalers in 2012 did these companies begin filing the reports. The newspaper said it found more than 7,000 reports in two boxes at the board\u2019s office. The regulations don\u2019t say what to do with them, so the board didn\u2019t investigate, contact wholesalers or pharmacies, or share them with law enforcement, the newspaper reported on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been an item that\u2019s ever been enforced by the board,\u201d said David Potters, the pharmacy board\u2019s executive director.\n\nDrug companies have racked up huge fines for failing to report suspicious orders in other states, but they refused to comment about their reports to West Virginia\u2019s board.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.24976778030396, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 981, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.7921188390199996, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220170000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.05810397553517, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mysterious-metallic-sound-in-the-mariana-trench-finally-identified/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1455]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 529, "scraper_regex": 565}}, "headline": "Mysterious metallic sound in the Mariana Trench finally identified", "wordcount_as_scraped": 565, "date": "20161216170000", "story_content": "An otherworldly noise that was recorded near the Mariana Trench could be a never-before-heard whale call.\n\nDubbed the \u201cWestern Pacific Biotwang,\u201d this newly discovered call might be from a minke whale \u2014 a type of baleen whale \u2014 according to the researchers who documented the vocalization.\n\nRegardless of what species it is, this whale has range: The call includes sounds that span frequencies that reach as low as 38 hertz and as high as 8,000 hertz. Humans can hear sounds between 20 and 20,000 Hz. [Images: Sharks & Whales from Above]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very distinct, with all these crazy parts,\u201d Sharon Nieukirk, senior faculty research assistant in marine bioacoustics at Oregon State University, said in a statement. \u201cThe low-frequency moaning part is typical of baleen whales, and it\u2019s that kind of twangy sound that makes it really unique. We don\u2019t find many new baleen whale calls.\u201d\n\nThe call was recorded with autonomous seafaring robots, known as \u201cpassive acoustic ocean gliders,\u201d which can dive up to 3,280 feet (1,000 meters) below the surface. Scientists can send these devices out on solo missions to eavesdrop on whale conversations. Nieukirk and her colleagues collected their acoustic data in the fall of 2014 and the spring of 2015, in an area in the Pacific Ocean east of Guam around the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the ocean. [Video: Take a Tour of the Mariana Trench] \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe twangy, five-part call, which lasts up to 3.5 seconds, was recorded regularly during both the fall and spring. The researchers hope that other scientists will identify the call in other data sets so that they can confirm the source. But in their description of the whale call in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Nieukirk and her colleagues wrote that they suspect a minke whale is responsible for the new call.\n\nBecause of the call\u2019s complex structure, frequencies and metallic-sounding conclusion, the researchers think that it most closely resembles the regionally specific calls that are produced by a group of dwarf minke whales off the northeast coast of Australia. (Those calls sound a bit like \u201cStar Wars\u201d sound effects.) They added that there are several types of minke whales in the survey area, but not much is known about their behavior \u2014 especially their vocal behavior.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know that much about minke whale distribution at low latitudes,\u201d Nieukirk said. \u201cThe species is the smallest of the baleen whales, doesn\u2019t spend much time at the surface, has an inconspicuous blow, and often lives in areas where high seas make sighting difficult. But they call frequently, making them good candidates for acoustic studies.\u201d\n\nThe call still needs to be translated. Most baleen whales use specific vocalizations for seasonal breeding and feeding, but this call \u2014 since it seems to occur all year \u2014 may have a complex function, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a mating call, why are we getting it year-round? That\u2019s a mystery,\u201d Nieukirk said. \u201cWe need to determine how often the call occurs in summer versus winter, and how widely this call is really distributed.\u201d\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time minke whales have puzzled scientists with their calls. In 2014, scientists solved a 50-year-old mystery when they figured out that the so-called \u201cbio-duck\u201d sound that was often recorded in the Southern Ocean was being produced by Antarctic minke whales.\n\nOriginal article on Live Science.

Tom Price to oversee the nation\u2019s health care system on Tuesday, picking a fierce \u201cObamacare\u201d critic who also has championed efforts to privatize Medicare. Trump selected another veteran Republican, Elaine Chao, to lead the Department of Transportation.\n\nBoth have long ties to Washington.\n\nPrice, picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services after more than a decade in Congress, helped craft House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s plan to privatize Medicare - a position Trump opposed in the campaign. Chao, who was the first Asian-American woman to serve in a president\u2019s Cabinet, is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nTrump announced his choice of Price, while the selection of Chao was confirmed by a person with knowledge of the decision but not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe selections came as Trump spent another day with advisers in his Manhattan skyscraper, racing through meetings with prospective administration hires as high-profile vacancies loom - none bigger than secretary of State.\n\nAs conservatives largely praised Tuesday\u2019s picks, Price\u2019s selection raised questions about the incoming president\u2019s commitment to Medicare, among other popular entitlement programs he repeatedly vowed to preserve before the election. The Georgia congressman led GOP efforts on Capitol Hill to transform Medicare into a voucher-like system, a change that if enacted, would likely dramatically reduce government spending on the health care program that serves an estimated 48 million elderly and another 9 million disabled people.\n\nTrump did not address Price\u2019s position on Medicare in a statement released by his transition team. The team did not respond to subsequent questions about it.\n\n\u201cChairman Price, a renowned physician, has earned a reputation for being a tireless problem solver and the go-to expert on health care policy, making him the ideal choice to serve in this capacity,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe is exceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare and bring affordable and accessible health care to every American.\u201d\n\nTrump, in a 2015 interview promoted on his campaign website, pledged not to cut expensive entitlement programs that Republicans have fought for years to cut to help reduce the federal deficit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican. And I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid. Every other Republican\u2019s going to cut,\u201d Trump told the Daily Signal.\n\nHe later changed his mind on Medicaid, embracing the GOP concept of turning the program over to the states with a fixed amount of federal \u201cblock grant\u201d funding.\n\nLike any Cabinet official, Price would carry out the wishes of the president. And a sweeping Medicare initiative would have to go through Congress with some Democratic support, which would be unlikely.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., a leading Democratic voice on health care, called Price a leader of the movement to privatize Medicare. She said his selection \u201cwill result in the complete undermining of our nation\u2019s health care system.\u201d\n\nLike Price, Chao is well-known in Washington, having led the Department of Labor for several years under Bush.\n\nHer record at the Labor Department suggests she would bring a light hand to safety enforcement as transportation secretary. Under Chao at Labor, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration didn\u2019t issue a single significant new safety regulation for four years. Mine safety inspectors were cut and inspections reduced.\n\nWhether it\u2019s integrating drones into the national airspace, deploying self-driving cars or \u201csome other new technology, she\u2019s not going to be especially inclined to second guess the industry when they say that this will be safe,\u201d said Thomas McGarity, a University of Texas law professor and author of \u201cFreedom to Harm,\u201d a book about the Labor Department that includes Chao\u2019s tenure.\n\nBoth Price and Chao would require Senate confirmation. Major Cabinet vacancies remain.\n\nThe president-elect summoned former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney to New York for dinner Tuesday night to discuss the secretary of state job for a second time. He was also meeting with Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who is getting new attention from Trump\u2019s team. On Monday, Trump spent an hour with former CIA director David Petraeus, another contender.\n\nTransition aides said Trump was likely at least a few days away from a decision.\n\nEven as he weighed crucial Cabinet decisions, Trump appeared distracted by outside issues - or eager to create distractions himself.

The only time in U.S. history when the share has been higher was in 1940, when the U.S. economy was regaining its footing from the Great Depression and the year prior to the country\u2019s entry into World War II.\u00a0\n\nThe number of millennials who fail to leave the nest has been climbing for the past 10 years, with the trend starting shortly before the Great Recession of 2008 but accelerating during the downturn and the recovery. The phenomenon is tied to a few factors, ranging from society shifts to economic headwinds. For one, Americans are delaying marriage and starting families. But the bigger issue may be the triple whammy of low wages, student debt and rapidly escalating rents.\u00a0\n\n\u201cEven though unemployment rates have decreased and the economy is picking up, we know wages are stagnant, so this will impact this generation of homebuyers,\u201d making it more challenging to save for a down payment, said Cheryl Young, senior economist at Trulia. \u201cThe millennials are getting married later and having fewer children, and that\u2019s particular to this generation.\u201d\n\nThe research echoes\u00a0findings from the Pew Research Center earlier this year, which found that 32.1 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds lived at their parents\u2019 homes in 2014, exceeding the 31.6 percent of young adults who were married or living with a partner in their own household. That marked a tipping point for the first time in modern history, since the norm for decades was for young adults to push out on their own after high school or college.\u00a0\n\nThe last decade hasn\u2019t been kind to America\u2019s youngest generation of adults. They came of age just as the economy fell into a recession, which caused higher unemployment rates and tighter credit markets. While it was tougher to qualify for a mortgage following the recession, millennials were also taking on increasing amounts of student debt.\u00a0\n\nThe typical undergraduate student borrower had $30,100 in student loan debt in 2016, a surge of 53 percent in just one decade, according to the Institute of College Access and Success.\u00a0\n\nSince the recession, housing prices have regained their footing. Rents have skyrocketed, thanks to the confluence of higher housing prices and the increased demand for rental apartments.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFor most people who take the traditional trajectory, you might rent, then you are ready to buy a home,\u201d Young said. \u201cBut if people are living with relatives, it means they aren\u2019t even able to rent. The rental prices are very high in some urban areas, and those are barriers for people to move out.\u201d\n\nMillennials are also earning less than Generation X took home at the same age, according to Pew. Millennial households in 2014 earned median income of $61,003, compared with an inflation-adjusted $63,365 for Gen Xers in 1998.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s created a perfect storm for parents and the real estate market: Homeownership rates for Americans in their 20s and 30s have plummeted, according to Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies. It\u2019s likely the impact will only worsen in the next few years since some young graduates have deferred their loan repayments, and those grace periods are coming to an end, the report predicted.\n\nSlightly more than 35 percent of Americans under the age of 35 own their own homes, a decline of 8 percentage points from 2004, Pew found in a study published earlier this month. The decline was sharpest for lower-income Americans, as well people who are unmarried.\u00a0\n\nStill, Young notes that many millennials are buying homes. Because their generation is currently the largest among all age groups, millennials still make up the biggest share of first-time home buyers, even after accounting for the living-at-home trend. One challenge for first-time home buyers is the lack of starter homes, or lower-priced homes that tend to attract first-time home buyers, Young noted.\n\nThe living-at-home trend has been closely watched by the real estate industry because the formation of new households -- when young adults rent their own apartments or buy their own homes -- is part of the engine that drives the housing market. It also helps boost the economy as a whole, given that those new householders need to buy everything from furniture to kitchenware.\u00a0\n\nBaby boomers may feel a culture gap when their adult kids move back home. After all, when they came of age in the 1970s, only about 25 percent of their cohort living at home, or close to the lowest share since 1940.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.0886470079422, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 589, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.881396337712, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 4, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.6791171477079799, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.363636363636}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/clarence-dean-convicted-in-killing-of-kristine-yitref-prostitute-in-times-square-hotel-9-years-later/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1094]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 605, "scraper_regex": 648}}, "headline": "Man convicted in killing of prostitute in Times Square hotel, 9 years later", "wordcount_as_scraped": 648, "date": "20161207020000", "story_content": "NEW YORK -- It took nearly a decade for a murder case over a prostitute\u2019s death in a shabby Times Square hotel to go to trial. But it took only about two hours for jurors to convict the suspect in a case that became a forum for debate over the validity of bite-mark evidence. Jurors began deliberating late Tuesday afternoon and soon reached a guilty verdict in the case against Clarence Dean, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said. Prosecutors and Dean\u2019s lawyer had no immediate comment. Dean, 44, now could face up to life in prison for Kristine Yitref\u2019s August 2007 death. It followed an encounter between two people at New York\u2019s fringes: he a convicted sex offender new to town, she a one-time design student turned crack-using streetwalker.\n\nArrested days after Yitref\u2019s body was found, Dean already has spent one of the longest pretrial spells in jail of any New York City suspect, partly because of the bite-mark dispute. He has declined to attend much of his trial, including closing arguments Tuesday.\u00a0\n\nProsecutors say Dean brutally killed Yitref, whose garbage-bagged body was found in his hotel room after he checked out. Dean told police he punched and choked Yitref but denied killing her, saying he blacked out from exertion while defending himself after she and her pimp attacked him and tried to steal his bag. \u201cMr. Dean had to fight off two desperate thieves that ambushed him in his hotel room,\u201d his lawyer, Sean Maher, said Tuesday. \u201cMr. Dean is innocent.\u201d But Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Robert Ferrari called Dean\u2019s claims \u201cutterly unworthy of belief.\u201d \u201cHe wasn\u2019t acting in self-defense when he killed Kristine Yitref. He was acting in a blind rage\u201d that broke a dozen of her ribs, shattered her breastbone and fractured her skull, Ferrari said. Yitref, 33, left her hometown of Yakima, Washington, in 1994 and landed in New York. She enrolled in design school but spiraled into drug use and a rough life. She\u2019d lost part of a finger about three months before her death, according to a friend who testified Tuesday; it\u2019s not clear what befell the finger. \u201cI just think the big city swallowed her up,\u201d Yitref\u2019s aunt, Kristine Hamilton, said earlier this year. Dean, 44, came to New York a few weeks before Yitref\u2019s death. He was wanted on charges of stealing a woman\u2019s car and draining her bank account in Tennessee and failing to comply with a sex offender registry law in Alabama. He had been required to register because of a lewd act involving a child in Palm Beach County, Florida. In New York, Dean got a job busing glasses and doing other tasks at a club. Yitref propositioned him as he walked to and from work, Maher said. After they went to his hotel room for a $40 tryst, Yitref\u2019s pimp burst in, joined Yitref in attacking him and then fled, Dean told police. He cleaned up and checked out the next day in a panic, his lawyer said. For years, prosecutors planned to include a controversial piece of evidence: a forensic comparison between Dean\u2019s teeth and a bite mark found on Yitref\u2019s body. Dean\u2019s defense contested the comparison as junk science. Nationwide, at least 24 men have been exonerated since 2000 after facing murder or rape charges or convictions based on bite marks. A judge ruled in 2013 that the bite mark evidence could be used in Dean\u2019s case. But this past January, prosecutors said they no longer needed it to prove their case. Jurors did hear about DNA found on the bite mark. Medical examiners determined the small DNA sample matched Yitref and an unidentified second person. The defense noted it didn\u2019t match Dean; the prosecution argued he simply didn\u2019t leave enough of his DNA behind.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -10.044977188110401, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 605, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.66597787248, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.13223140495868, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/loving-movie-richard-mildred-interracial-marriage-virginia-impact/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 728, "scraper_regex": 809}}, "headline": "How Richard and Mildred Loving \"paved the way\" for interracial marriage", "wordcount_as_scraped": 809, "date": "20161122200000", "story_content": "The new movie, \u201cLoving,\u201d chronicles the lengthy fight for interracial couples to get married in the U.S. Mildred and Richard Loving were the couple behind the landmark Supreme Court case when the state of Virginia challenged their marriage more than 50 years ago.\n\nThe Lovings were a quiet, unassuming couple from rural Virginia who got married hoping to live among their friends and family, but quickly ended up in the middle of a decade-long legal battle. In the end, their struggle shows how regular people can change the world, reports CBS News correspondent Jan Crawford.  \u201cWe were married on the June -- second day of June, and the police came after us the 14th of July,\u201d Mildred said in a January 1965 interview with CBS.\n\nMildred and Richard Loving were unlikely civil rights pioneers. The new movie tells their story: married in 1958 in Washington, D.C., they were arrested when they returned home to central Virginia.  Authorities ordered them to leave Virginia or face five years in prison for violating the state\u2019s ban on interracial marriage, as the couple explained in the CBS interview.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to, you know, leave away from around my family and friends,\u201d Mildred said. \n\n\u201cLeaving my home was the hardest for me. Because I didn\u2019t see why it made sense to have her leave,\u201d Richard said.  The Lovings settled in Washington, and seeing the struggle for civil rights up close gave them hope. Philip Hirschkop was a recent law school graduate who, along with law partner Bernard Cohen, got involved in the Loving\u2019s fight after Mildred wrote a letter to the American Civil Liberties Union. Initially it was seen as a simple criminal case. \u201cDid you know right away this is a case that could change history?\u201d Crawford asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hirschkop said. \u201cIf it was something of such great note, there\u2019s no way the ACLU would\u2019ve let Bernie Cohen and me do it. He was two years out of law school with no experience whatever, and I was two months out of law school.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo months?\u201d Crawford said. \n\n\u201cSaying we had no significant Supreme Court experience is overstating it. We had no Supreme Court experience,\u201d Hirschkop said, chuckling.\n\nDespite the civil rights milestones of the 1960s, more than a dozen states at the time still banned interracial marriage. \u201cThose who support such laws claim they are necessary in order to preserve the purity of the races,\u201d one CBS News reporter said in 1965 in front of the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cUltimately the courts were our saviors,\u201d Hirschkop said. The Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren was ready to end those laws. Its unanimous decision in Loving v. Virginia immediately changed the lives of interracial couples across the country -- including Rolf and Joan Esser. \u201cDid you ever think, \u2018I\u2019m getting married. I want to get married where I grew up?\u2019\u201d Crawford asked. \n\n\u201cExactly. But I knew it was illegal,\u201d Joan said. Born just miles from the Lovings in Doswell, Virginia, Joan moved to New York in the mid-1950s where at a party she met Rolf.  \u201cA black beauty. A princess,\u201d Rolf said, describing Joan.  A German immigrant, Rolf was captivated.  \u201cDid you know that it might be considered illegal to have a relationship?\u201d Crawford asked.  \u201cNo, no. I thought there was nothing wrong with it. Of course, you know, it was not a common thing. I know that,\u201d Rolf said.  When the Essers decided to get married in 1968, Joan assumed they couldn\u2019t return to Virginia. \u201cSo we planned our wedding in New York, and I thought, \u2018It\u2019s going to be so sad. My parents won\u2019t be there. My family, my siblings. \u2026 And then I got a phone call from my mom telling me that there\u2019d been a Supreme Court ruling. \u2026 She said, \u2018You can now legally get married down here!\u2019\u201d Joan recalled.  All because an unassuming couple was determined to go back home. \u201cSo they were the pioneers for us. They made -- paved the way,\u201d Joan said. And idealistic lawyers believed the country was ready for a new direction. \u201cThere were a lot of outside influences that had nothing to do with our abilities,\u201d Hirschkop said.\n\n\u201cBut it still changed history,\u201d Crawford said.\n\n\u201cIt did. And it\u2019s -- these press interviews don\u2019t do much for me on it, but sometimes when I shave in the morning there\u2019s no one else there, I can look in the mirror and say to myself, \u2018Hey pop, I did right,\u2019\u201d Hirschkop said.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s groundbreaking decision in Loving vs. Virginia confirmed the right to marry was protected by the Constitution and paved the way for future barriers to be broken. Last summer, the court overturned state laws banning same-sex marriage, a decision that wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Mildred and Richard Loving.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.94117641448975, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 728, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.6566616720400003, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161122200000, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 4.258241758241759, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/where-you-live-may-determine-how-you-die/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [532, 3652]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 563, "scraper_regex": 609}}, "headline": "Where you live may determine how you die", "wordcount_as_scraped": 609, "date": "20161213220000", "story_content": "People along the southern stretch of the Mississippi River are more likely to die from heart problems than anywhere else in the United States.\n\nSuicide and homicide will claim the most lives in the southwestern part of the country.\n\nDeaths from chronic respiratory diseases are greatest in eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia.\n\nAnd mental and substance abuse disorders cause the most deaths in Alaska, eastern Arizona, New Mexico, eastern Kentucky and southwestern West Virginia.\n\nWhat\u00a0causes a person\u2019s death depends in large part on where they spend their lives, concludes a new county-level analysis of U.S. mortality data.\n\nArmed with this sort of information, county and city health departments can focus their efforts on the specific problems affecting their communities, said lead researcher Ali Mokdad.

In this way, we\u2019re telling them what to tackle first.\u201d\n\nFor the study, researchers reviewed more than 80.4 million deaths recorded from 1980 through 2014 in the United States, analyzing mortality rates for 3,110 counties or groups of counties.\n\nThe investigators found large disparities between counties for every cause of death, both within states and across the country as a whole.\n\nFor example, the researchers found that people in the southeastern United States are burdened with risk factors like obesity and smoking that increase the risk of dying from heart disease and diabetes, Mokdad said.\n\nAt the same time, people living in parts of New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, and North and South Dakota tend to drink more alcohol, and are more likely to die from cirrhosis or other chronic liver diseases, the findings showed.\n\nOn the other hand, people in northern and central Colorado benefit from \u201cliving healthier than anywhere else,\u201d Mokdad said. \u201cYou see less death from certain chronic diseases.

As a therapist, she says she has seen Mr. Trump\u2019s language lead to an uptick in distress from young girls. Along the protest route, many women expressed this rising anxiety.\n\n\u201cAll of the girls in law school terrified about the Supreme Court. And it is hard in law school where everyone is very conservative,\u201d said Clair Hollingsworth, a 24-yr old law school student in South Carolina, who drove over 7 hours to be at the march. \u201cBeing here allows you to feel that you are not alone, it shows I\u2019m not the only one who is afraid.\u201d\n\nIn streets where no one could move without meeting a new friend -- and grasping onto an inspiring or humor-filled sign -- it was impossible to feel alone. The signs called for love, unity and Trump\u2019s demise. They read things like: \u201cBe brave choose love,\u201d \u201cNasty Enough,\u201d \u201cTrumpity Dumpity,\u201d \u201cWe Love Women,\u201d and \u201cFree Melania.\u201d Many were decorated with images of women and women\u2019s private parts.\n\nPink dominated. Many women sported knitted pink \u201cpussyhats.\u201d\u00a0 But men also wore those hats. \u201cI love women,\u201d said one father who was at the march with his daughter. The duo had picked up their fuzzy pink decorations in Virginia from one of the hat distribution centers where women from around the world sent hats they had made for marchers to sport on the streets.\n\n\u201cIt is her first protest,\u201d said Meredith Monroe with a smile on her face as she looked at her 8-month old wearing a puffy pink getup. \u201cWe have three generations here,\u201d Monroe added, pointing to her mother.\n\nChildren were a big part of the day. When demonstrators got stuck in a standstill for an hour and a half, a 9-month gnawing on crackers old kept a small crowd entertained, detracting their minds from a sense of overwhelming claustrophobia.\n\nWith marchers from all over the country, the LGBTQ community was also a vocal presence on the streets. Some women wrapped their bodies in rainbow flags.\n\n\u201cI am here because I have seen too many women taken advantage of by men. I don\u2019t want to live in a country where I feel unsafe and have to look around look over my shoulder when I walk to work. I am terrified for my own life became I\u2019m gay,\u201d explained 20 year old Delaney Sandlin who flew to came from Jacksonville. She said she feels that more with Mr. Trump as president -- yet knowing that sister marches were happening worldwide gave her a sense of peace.\n\nHere are the voices of four of the marchers, explaining why they came out to march:\n\n\u201cI came here with my sister-in-law and my friend from North Carolina. When I first heard about this, I knew I had to attend. I\u2019m a first generation immigrant. My dad came to this country from Germany right after World War II. He was terrified when President Trump won the election. I wanted to come here because I wanted to make a difference, I wanted to have my voice here. The mood at this event has been very positive. It\u2019s energizing and inspiring (She been at the event since 8 am) I\u2019m hoping that through this march our president and Congress will see that they can\u2019t mess with us women, and that we don\u2019t want to go backwards. I feel like the political rhetoric from Trump is setting us back (referring to women\u2019s healthcare, education). The mood of the whole campaign, seems like going back in time, but we don\u2019t want to go back, we want to move forward. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my lifetime, that\u2019s why I\u2019m marching.\u201d\n\nIke: \u201cPersonally, what made me want to come to this march is that I wanted to be a part of something that was bigger than me. I hope Trump does not do something crazy, especially when it comes to women\u2019s rights. I\u2019m here because I want to support my girlfriend, and other women, who want to have control of their own bodies. I\u2019m from Indiana, and I know what Pence has been doing there with Planned Parenthood. I want to make sure that my girlfriend (Stephanie), and every woman, is OK and protected. I felt like I had to. Honestly, after the election I was very angry and even depressed. But coming here has sort of changed that. I feel energized, like I\u2019m joining people who feel the same way I do, and it feels like what I\u2019m feeling makes sense, that other people were worried too, but we\u2019re here to have our voices heard.\u201d\n\nStephanie: \u201cI\u2019m here because I want to support equal rights and women\u2019s rights. And being here, I can tell that everyone around me feels the same way.\u201d\n\nEbony:\u00a0\u201cWe came down here this morning, from New York City. We hit the road at 6:00 am. I know there\u2019s a march in New York City, but I felt like I had to be here, in D.C. It feels like this is where the grassroots movement is happening, it had to be here, I had to be here. I\u2019m here because I am defending women\u2019s rights, equal rights and LGBT rights. I\u2019m really happy I came here, the mood here has been so positive. I really believe this is the start of something big.\u201d\n\nCBS News\u2019 Jareen Imam contributed to this report from Washington, D.C.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.6711409687995911, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1083, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.58731808559, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170122040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.21606648199446, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tech-leaders-to-make-peace-or-press-their-case-with-trump/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 843, "scraper_regex": 935}}, "headline": "Tech leaders to make peace, or press their case, with Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 935, "date": "20161214140000", "story_content": "SAN FRANCISCO - Silicon Valley leaders were among Donald Trump\u2019s most outspoken opponents during the presidential campaign. On Wednesday, though, many of them will come face-to-face with the president-elect for the first time since the election.\n\nThe tech industry had multiple concerns about Candidate Trump, among them fears that he would stifle innovation, curb the hiring of computer-savvy immigrants and infringe on consumers\u2019 digital privacy. Those worries may not have abated, but that\u2019s not stopping technology leaders from heading to Trump Tower in New York to make their peace - or press their case - with Trump and his advisers.\n\n\u201cThe election of Donald Trump surprised Silcon Valley but that\u2019s an opportunity to view that as a wakeup call,\u201d AOL co-founder Steve Case told CBS News correspondent Don Dahler.\n\nThe CEOs planning to attend include Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Alphabet\u2019s Larry Page, Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Intel\u2019s Brian Krzanich, IBM\u2019s Ginni Rometty, Oracle\u2019s Safra Catz and Cisco Systems\u2019 Chuck Robbins.\n\nFacebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, will be on hand instead of its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who was one of many tech executives to express misgivings about Trump\u2019s pledge to deport millions of immigrants.\n\nIt could be a prickly meeting.\n\nNo other industry was more open in its contempt for Trump during the campaign. In an open letter published in July, more than 140 technology executives, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists skewered Trump as a \u201cdisaster for innovation.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s denigration of Mexicans, his pledge to deport millions of immigrants now living in the U.S. illegally, and his crude remarks about women were widely viewed as racist, authoritarian and sexist by an industry that prides itself on its tolerance.\n\nTrump, in turn, sometimes lashed out at the industry and its leaders.\n\nHe lambasted Bezos for the campaign coverage of his newspaper, The Washington Post, and suggested that Amazon could face antitrust scrutiny if he was elected.\n\nTrump also rebuked Cook for fighting a government order requiring Apple to unlock an encrypted iPhone used by a shooter in last year\u2019s terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s repeated screeds against immigrants raised fears that he might dismantle programs that have enabled tech companies to hire tens of thousands of foreign workers with the skills to write computer programs, design web pages and build mobile apps.\n\nThe industry is also worried that Trump might try to undermine \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d a regulation requiring internet service providers to offer equal access to all online services. Trump\u2019s harsh characterization of the media as dishonest and unfair has raised other fears that he might even try to restrict free speech online.\n\nSome in Silicon Valley think the industry\u2019s best move would be to keep its distance until Trump changes his tone. Former Google executive Chris Sacca, now a tech investor, argues that industry leaders should steer clear of the meeting altogether.\n\nSitting down with the president-elect \u201cwould only make sense after Trump has given public assurances he won\u2019t encourage censorship, will stop exploiting fake news, will promote net neutrality, denounce hate crimes, and embrace science,\u201d Sacca said. \u201cIf and until then, tech figures who visit are being used to whitewash an authoritarian bully who threatens not just our industry, but our entire democracy.\u201d\n\nMost of the companies with executives attending Wednesday\u2019s meeting declined to comment ahead of the gathering. But Oracle\u2019s Catz said in a statement that she plans to tell Trump \u201cthat we are with him and are here to help in any way we can. If he can reform the tax code, reduce regulation, and negotiate better trade deals, the U.S. technology community will be stronger and more competitive than ever.\u201d\n\nOther tech institutions are also signaling an end to the animosity.\n\nThe Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Google, Facebook and Amazon, praised Trump in an open letter last month for his use of Twitter and other digital tools to help him get elected. The letter also appealed to Trump\u2019s emphasis on the economy, citing statistics estimating that the internet sector accounted for nearly $1 trillion of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nSome conservatives say they\u2019re actually worried that Trump might get too friendly with tech. Peter Flaherty, the president of the National Legal and Policy Center, charges that big technology companies exploited their close relationship with President Obama \u201cto feather their nests and push for policies that benefit them at the expense of the American worker.\u201d\n\nTrump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said by email that the president-elect \u201clooks forward to meeting with this important group of industry leaders and true innovators.\u201d\n\nThe technology industry already supports one of Trump\u2019s ideas. He has promised to temporarily reduce the corporate tax on foreign profits from the current 35 percent to 10 percent to give U.S. companies an incentive to bring their overseas cash back home.\n\nIt\u2019s a cut that Cook has been pushing Congress to make because Apple has $216 billion, or 91 percent of its total cash, in overseas accounts. Other tech companies in line to benefit the most from a tax reduction include Microsoft, Cisco, Microsoft and Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet.\n\nBut Trump might not be doing many other favors for technology companies given his history of holding grudges against his opponents, said Larry Irving, a former government affairs executive for Hewlett-Packard who now runs a consulting firm.\n\n\u201cEverything Trump has done so far suggests that he rewards loyalty and punishes disloyalty,\u201d Irving said. \u201cThe tech industry better have some pontoons ready.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.69565224647522, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 843, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.3153786416, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 8, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 45, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214140000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 5.33807829181495, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.090909090909999}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/yahoo-hack-what-you-should-do-change-password/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [101, 2778, 4252, 4477, 4635]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 796, "scraper_regex": 921}}, "headline": "What you should do if you were hit by the Yahoo hack", "wordcount_as_scraped": 921, "date": "20161215200000", "story_content": "Last Updated Dec 15, 2016 4:33 PM EST\n\nNEW YORK -\u00a0 The latest hack impacting more than one billion Yahoo accounts has users all over the world worried about how to protect their digital privacy.\n\nNews that the struggling internet company was breached back in 2013 \u2014 coming on top of a separate hack that exposed some 500 million Yahoo users \u2014 should serve as a reminder that everyone\u2019s email and personal information is vulnerable to hacking.\n\n\u201cThey got users\u2019 names, birthdays, they got encrypted passwords \u2014 though the passwords may not have been encrypted with secure technology \u2014 and they got answers to security questions, so if you had a Yahoo account and you typed in your mother\u2019s maiden name or the name of your first pet \u2014 all of that information was accessed by hackers,\u201d NewYorker.com editor and CBS News contributor Nicholas Thompson said on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d\n\nSafeguards you can take include creating strong passwords and changing them when you have to. Yes, all this is a pain, and it\u2019s not your fault that the tech industry hasn\u2019t been able to stem the rise in security breaches. But if you do nothing, you could be putting your personal or financial information \u2014 or even your identity \u2014 at risk.\n\nIt\u2019s a good place to start. While some security experts argue that it\u2019s more important to pick a complicated password than to change them frequently, if you haven\u2019t changed your Yahoo password since 2013 do it now.\n\nAnd even if you have changed your Yahoo password in the last three years, you might want to do it anyway. Breaches are often worse than they first appear. LinkedIn disclosed earlier this year that a 2012 breach affected 117 million accounts \u2014 not the 6.5 million previously thought.\n\nThe more complicated and lengthy a password is, the harder it will be for hackers to guess.\n\nDon\u2019t include your kids\u2019 names, birthdays or references to any other personal details. Hackers routinely troll Facebook and Twitter for clues to passwords like these. Obvious and default passwords such as \u201cPassword123\u201d are also bad, as are words commonly found in dictionaries, as these are used in programs hackers have to automate guesses.\n\nLong and random combinations of letters, numbers and other characters work best.\n\nYour password reset questions should be as unique as possible too, and don\u2019t be tempted to recycle those either. This was some of the information stolen in the Yahoo hack. And with the help of social media, it\u2019s not hard for hackers to find those little personal tidbits like what your mother\u2019s maiden name is, or the name of your hometown.\n\nYahoo recommended that users who haven\u2019t updated their passwords since 2014 do so now. These passwords were encrypted through a tool known as bcrypt.\u00a0\n\nBrett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO ALliance, a nonprofit that vets login systems, told CNET.com that this form of encryption is able to be burst through with enough persistence by hackers.\n\n\u201cYahoo users with relatively weak or obvious passwords should take the recommended precautions,\u201d he said.\n\nNo. Avoid using the same password for multiple sites, so that a break of your school\u2019s PTA site wouldn\u2019t lead hackers to your online banking account.\n\nYou can make things easier on yourself by using a password-manager service such as LastPass or DashLane. They remember complex passwords for you \u2014 but you have to trust them. Last year, LastPass disclosed \u201csuspicious activity\u201d and told users to change their master passwords.\n\nSome web browsers such as Apple\u2019s Safari and Google\u2019s Chrome also have built-in password managers. They work if you switch devices but not if you switch browsers.\n\nMulti-factor identification \u2014 which asks users to enter a second form of identification, such as a code texted to their phone \u2014 will provide additional protections. It\u2019s now commonplace for many email and social media accounts.\n\nEven if hackers manage to get your password they would be unable to get in without the code texted to your phone.\n\nTech companies are also working on a number of futuristic solutions, including biometrics and photo-based \u201cselfie passwords,\u201d but it will take some time for them to be fully developed, tested and rolled out for widespread use.\u00a0\n\nDelete or deactivate accounts you no longer use. Has your Yahoo email account been filled with spam since before the invention of smartphones? Maybe it\u2019s time to say goodbye.\n\nNicholas Thompson\u2019s advice is straightforward:\u00a0\u201cDelete your account.\u201d Thompson stressed that all of the reporting since the initial word of the hack has made it clear that Yahoo \u201cde-prioritized security.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cSecurity is expensive,\u201d he said, taking critical aim at Yahoo. \u201cIt\u2019s  like putting bars on your windows. It costs money, and it makes the view a little less pretty.\u201d\n\nThat goes for social media too \u2014 close down accounts you don\u2019t use anymore (remember Myspace?). This often can be done through your account settings, as long as you still have your password to sign in.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re on the subject of social media, make sure you restrict posts to just your actual friends. You can adjust that in the settings.\n\nSome companies try to help their users with this. Facebook, for example, occasionally prompts its users to review who can see their personal information and how strong their security settings are.\n\nNonetheless, assume that everyone everywhere can see what you\u2019re posting. That\u2019ll keep hackers from harvesting those juicy details they can use to crack into your accounts.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.8376843929290803, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 796, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.28903242037, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 13, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.6331658291457298, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.1818181818200002}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/yahoo-hack-law-enforcement-believes-state-actor-us-official-says/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [242, 294, 483, 620, 622, 790, 1436, 2211, 2213, 2215, 2216, 2280, 2580, 2759, 2991, 3381, 3698, 4001, 4504, 4765, 5083, 5291, 5437]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 804, "scraper_regex": 872}}, "headline": "Law enforcement says Yahoo account hacks were likely sponsored by foreign government", "wordcount_as_scraped": 872, "date": "20161215200000", "story_content": "SAN FRANCISCO -- A U.S. official briefed on the Yahoo hack tells CBS News that law enforcement agrees with the company in saying the hacks were a state actor.\u00a0\n\nThe state actor is believed to be tied to Russia.\u00a0\n\nYahoo revealed on Wednesday that information was stolen from more than 1 billion user accounts in 2013 after disclosing a separate hack in 2014 of some 500 million accounts in September.\u00a0\n\nIn a statement, Yahoo said they believe \u201csome of this activity to the same state-sponsored actor\u201d responsible for the September hack. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYahoo shares slid Thursday on worries that Verizon will walk away or slash its $4.8 billion offer for the company\u2019s digital operations after the massive data breach.\u00a0\n\nVerizon had said it would reevaluate the Yahoo deal after the first hack, and said the same Wednesday after the latest revelation. Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni on Thursday declined to comment beyond the company\u2019s Wednesday-night statement. Yahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The deal was expected to close by March 2017. If the hacks drive Yahoo\u2019s users away, the company wouldn\u2019t be as valuable to the telecom giant in its quest to build a digital-ad business that could rival industry giants Google and Facebook. Yahoo has said that the September announcement of the 2014 hack didn\u2019t hurt traffic to its services.\u00a0\n\nYahoo shares fell 4.7 percent, or $1.91, to $39 in afternoon trading. Verizon shares rose 40 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $52.03.\n\nThe digital heist disclosed Wednesday occurred in August 2013.\n\nYahoo previously disclosed that its outside forensic experts were investigating the creation of forged cookies that could allow an intruder to access users\u2019 accounts without a password. Based on the ongoing investigation, the company believes an unauthorized third party accessed the company\u2019s proprietary code to learn how to forge cookies,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe outside forensic experts have identified user accounts for which they believe forged cookies were taken or used. Yahoo is notifying the affected account holders, and has invalidated the forged cookies.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d security expert Avivah Litan of Gartner Inc.\u00a0\n\nYahoo didn\u2019t say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn\u2019t been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion.\u00a0\n\nYahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks.\u00a0\n\nIn both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected.\u00a0\n\nBut hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled twice \u2014 once by encryption and once by another technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases.\u00a0That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can\u2019t be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you\u2019ve changed your password and questions since September.)\u00a0Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn\u2019t appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn\u2019t the work of ordinary criminals.\u00a0That means most Yahoo users probably don\u2019t have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security.\n\nNews of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo\u2019s plans to fall into Verizon\u2019s arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company\u2019s services wouldn\u2019t be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business.\u00a0After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the \u201cnew development before reaching any final conclusions.\u201d Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions.\u00a0At the very least, the security lapses \u201cdefinitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price,\u201d Litan predicted.

Festing had cited the Knights\u2019 status as a sovereign entity in refusing to cooperate with what he said was an act of internal governance.\n\nThe remarkable showdown though was fraught from the start given Festing took a promise of obedience to the pope as a top-level knight, and regardless was the leader of a prominent Catholic order who was entering into a public fray with the leader of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe spat unfolded against the backdrop of Francis\u2019 increasing clashes with more conservative elements in the church, especially those for whom sexual ethics and doctrinal orthodoxy are paramount. The dispute had once again pit Francis against Cardinal Raymond Burke, a leading conservative and Francis critic who also happens to be the pope\u2019s envoy to the order.\n\nBurke had been by Festing\u2019s side on Dec. 6 when Festing first asked, then demanded Boeselager\u2019s resignation. Boeselager refused, and was ousted two days later under a disciplinary procedure he contends violated the order\u2019s own rules.\n\nMany of the orders members had lamented how the confrontation with the Holy See had drawn unwanted negative attention to the order, which relies on donations to fund its huge charity works around the globe.\n\nFesting suspended Boeselager on Dec. 8 over revelations that the Knights\u2019 charity branch Malteser International had distributed thousands of condoms to poor people in Myanmar under his watch.\n\nChurch teaching forbids artificial contraception. Boeselager has said he stopped the programs when he learned of them. The order\u2019s leadership has said the scandal was grave, that Boeselager had hidden the revelations, and called it \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that he had refused an order to obey Festing and resign.\n\nBoeselager has challenged his ouster with an appeal to the Knights\u2019 internal tribunal.\n\nFrancis appointed a commission to investigate after Boeselager said he had been told by Festing, in Burke\u2019s presence, that the Holy See wanted him to resign over the scandal. The Vatican secretary of state has said the pope wanted nothing of the sort and wanted the dispute to be resolved through dialogue.\n\nLast week, the Holy See said it expected the order to cooperate with its probe, and in a sharply worded statement said it planned to take action to resolve the dispute. Canon lawyers had raised alarm at the investigation, giving it seemed to set the stage for one sovereign entity intervening in the internal affairs of another.\n\nThe Order of Malta has many trappings of a sovereign state, issuing its own stamps, passports and license plates and holding diplomatic relations with 106 states, the Holy See included.\n\nThe Holy See, however, has a unique relationship with the order since it is a Catholic entity, and the pope appoints a cardinal to \u201cpromote the spiritual interests\u201d of the order and its relationship with the Vatican. Francis appointed Burke to that position in 2014 after removing him as the Vatican\u2019s supreme court justice.\n\nThe knights trace their history to the 11th-century Crusades with the establishment of an infirmary in Jerusalem that cared for people of all faiths.

Schmit is best known for his work with Poco and the Eagles, but the musician also performs as a solo artist and just released new album \u201cLeap of Faith.\u201d Schmit recently attended the Kennedy Center Honors, where he and other members of the Eagles were acknowledged for their influence on American culture.\u00a0\n\nSchmit talked to CBS News about the death of his bandmate Glenn Frey and the possibility of an Eagles reunion, his solo work and what he\u2019s looking forward to in his career.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat was it like for you to be at the Kennedy Center Honors?\n\nWell, that would take up a lot of time. It was a lot of things. To try and sum it up, it was indeed a big honor, a once in a lifetime thing. I got to meet the president and go to four events over the weekend. The one on TV was the last of four events so there was a lot going on. It\u2019s not every day people get to go to the White House and have these tributes to you. It was kind of a Cinderella weekend.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between working solo and working with a band?\n\nWell, working solo means you don\u2019t have to account for anybody else. You do it yourself so you\u2019re not trying to please others as well as yourself, you\u2019re just trying to do the best you can. It\u2019s kind of freeing in a way because you don\u2019t have to run it past anybody else unless you want to and that\u2019s the way I\u2019ve been doing my solo albums the last couple times. \n\nDo you miss the camaraderie of working with a band at all?\n\nYeah, I do. Lately I\u2019ve been missing \u201cthe big stage.\u201d I guess because it was part of my life for many years and I do miss it, but I try not to dwell in the past too much. You gotta move forward. This is what I\u2019m doing now and I\u2019m happy to do it. \n\nWhat inspired your new album \u201cLeap of Faith\u201d?\n\nWell, I try to write songs at any given time, when the mood strikes and whenever I have the one or two songs ready to record, then I start that process. I never really know how it\u2019s going to come out but I have sort of a vague idea in my head and the process is basically me singing with an acoustic guitar and then I do the work afterward. \u201cLeap of Faith\u201d was recorded in layers. \n\nTell me about the track \u201cRed Dirt Road.\u201d\n\nThat song was written quite a while ago -- quite a few years ago, actually. It\u2019s kind of about -- there\u2019s even a line in there about sowing seeds -- we do our work before we do our play. The work, really probably at the time, alluded to raising kids and doing the stuff that really matters before you have some time to goof off. It\u2019s about doing your work so you can have the freedom to enjoy doing something other than your work. \n\nYou just talked about raising kids. How did fatherhood change your life? \n\nOh jeez, I\u2019ve been a dad for two thirds of my life. I had a baby when I was 22 years old and that was a long time ago and then I had two others later on and now they\u2019re completely out of the house. My youngest is 26 and so I hardly remember life not being a father but my wife and I were hands on-parents. I traveled a lot but we didn\u2019t hire nannies to take care of our kids. We were both very hands-on. My wife did the lion\u2019s share because I traveled a lot, but it was important to us to do our best. Being a parent is one of the hardest jobs there is. It\u2019s one of the greatest things, too, but it\u2019s also probably the hardest thing anybody ever does. \n\nTell me about how your work and life changed since Glenn Frey\u2019s passing. \n\nWell, it affected everything. Everything changed with his passing and even before that because he was very sick for quite a long time before he passed away. I try not to dwell on the past too much because it\u2019s very important to try and stay aware of what\u2019s going on today and look forward to the future, so we all do the best we can. That was a big deal. It was a big event. \n\nWhat are your fondest memories of him?\n\nOh, I\u2019ll just say that he was a very intense personality in every direction, that I really enjoyed him the most when he -- he had a great laugh and he could be extremely funny. Those are the times I think I\u2019ll remember the most. \n\nYou were so young when you were starting in Poco and the Eagles. How has your outlook changed on being a performer? \u00a0\n\nWell, I\u2019m older so I\u2019ve learned a lot, but there\u2019s still so much to learn. I think I\u2019m happier about my songwriting in general and the discipline it takes to do that. I try and work every day, you know, a songwriter is self-motivation. You don\u2019t have a boss and you\u2019re not punching a clock or anything so you have to keep doing it yourself on your own terms and I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m able to in some ways take it more seriously.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s still a lot of fun and a lot of hard work but I think I\u2019m actually getting better at it and still learning. I think I\u2019m starting to come into my own as a songwriter. At least that\u2019s how I feel personally and that\u2019s nice because a lot of people hit their peak when they\u2019re way younger and I feel like I haven\u2019t really gotten there yet. Makes me look forward to the next day.\n\nWhat are your goals and dreams at this point?\n\nI love to perform, sing, write songs. That\u2019s what I do and that\u2019s what I hope to continue to do. I hope every day I\u2019m able to keep my eyes open to everything, even not just professionally. There\u2019s less time in front of me than there is behind me and I hope to sort of hone down the art of enjoying it and appreciation and gratitude. \n\nIs there any hope for an Eagles reunion? \n\nNo. Certainly not as the Eagles. The Eagles without Glenn -- it\u2019s over. What happens in the future, if anything with Don and Joe and I -- I have no clue. Nothing\u2019s been talked about and I think we\u2019re still processing this huge change in our lives, so I don\u2019t know. The real answer is we don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see what happens.

And Kushner\u2019s role could expand. There has already been some implication that he could be privy to the Presidential Daily Briefing (PDB) -- in order to receive it, Kushner would need a \u201ctop secret/SCI\u201d clearance, a former top CIA official told CBS News.\n\nTop Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway was asked by reporters Wednesday whether it would be appropriate for Kushner to get a security clearance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s appropriate for whoever\u2019s going to get the presidential daily briefing to have a security clearance,\u201d said Conway. \u201cIt\u2019s not just appropriate, necessary.\u201d\n\nBut an appointment for Kushner in the Trump White House could run afoul of federal anti-nepotism laws. A 1967 statute explicitly forbids the president from appointing relations -- the law was written to include a son-in-law -- to any executive agency. \n\nHere\u2019s what the statute says: \u201cA public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official.\u201d\n\nThis would seem to bar Kushner from taking a role within the White House -- though, as CBS News legal reporter Paula Reid points out, there are some exceptions.\n\nThe law allows for waivers in the event of a national disaster or other unforeseen circumstances. But it\u2019s hard to argue that transitioning to the presidency could be considered an unforeseen circumstance. In any case, such a waiver would only allow for a temporary appointment. \n\nLawyers for Mr. Trump could try to argue that the part of the law which prohibits relatives from getting paid means an unpaid role would be legal.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAn individual appointed, employed, promoted, or advanced in violation of this section is not entitled to pay, and money may not be paid from the Treasury as pay to an individual so appointed, employed, promoted, or advanced,\u201d the statute reads. Kushner himself has floated the possibility of advising the White House without pay, according to the Wall Street Journal. \n\nIt is not clear whether the statute would apply to the White House, which, it could be argued, might not be technically considered a government agency. The original statute was written as a response to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s appointment of his brother, Bobby Kennedy, to head the Justice Department as attorney general.\n\nAnd despite the existence of the law, there\u2019s no clear penalty or repercussion if an individual -- much less the president -- violates the statute.\n\nFor now, top Trump officials are saying little about whether or not Kushner will have a defined role in the White House.\n\n\u201cHe obviously is incredibly important to his father-in-law President-Elect Trump and was [a] big part of our election victory, frankly,\u201d Conway told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m sure that he and his wife and her brothers will continue to be very supportive. But time will tell in terms of the positions that different people fill.\u201d\u00a0\n\nCBS News\u2019 Paula Reid contributed to this report.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.816993474960327, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 557, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.5698461665599996, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161117200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 5.38599640933573, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/suspected-us-drone-strike-kills-three-alleged-al-qaeda-members-yemen/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1037]}}, "headline": "Suspected U.S. drone strike kills three alleged al Qaeda members in Yemen, a first for Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 606, "date": "20170122160000", "story_content": "SANAA, Yemen - Suspected U.S. drone strikes have killed three alleged al Qaeda operatives in Yemen\u2019s southwestern Bayda province, security and tribal officials said, the first such killings reported in the country since Donald Trump assumed the U.S. presidency Friday.\n\nThe two Saturday strikes killed Abu Anis al-Abi, an area field commander, and two others, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release the information to journalists.\n\nU.S. drone strikes against suspected al Qaeda targets have been commonplace in the years since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, as a retaliatory measure against the group. The use of unmanned aircraft as well as air strikes in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country rose dramatically under President Barack Obama, with data from the Britain-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism showing spikes in attacks, especially in 2012 and 2016.\n\nLast summer,\u00a0then-President Obama took the unusual step of acknowledging the \u201clegitimate criticism\u201d of U.S. drone strikes in the Middle East that have caused civilian deaths. At the same time, he said the U.S. has now \u201cconstructed a fairly rigid and vigorous set of criteria\u201d to justify continued drone strikes that kill whole groups of people at once.\n\n\u201cIn the past, there was legitimate criticism that the legal architecture around the use of drone strikes wasn\u2019t as precise as it should have been,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that civilians were killed that shouldn\u2019t have been.\u201d\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have said as many as 117 civilians had been killed in drone and other counterterror attacks in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere during Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nHuman rights and other groups criticized the Obama administration, saying it undercounted civilian casualties. They also worried that President Trump will more aggressively conduct drone strikes, which are subject to little oversight from Congress or the judiciary.\n\nIn the years since the drone program began, Yemen has fallen ever deeper into chaos. A two-year-old civil war began after Shiite Houthis rebels seized the capital Sanaa and forced the President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee the country, prompting the launch of an extensive air campaign by a Saudi-led coalition that began in March 2015 aimed at restoring Hadi\u2019s government.\n\nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, long seen by Washington as among the most dangerous branches of the global terror network, exploited the chaos, seizing territory in the country\u2019s south and east, and the Islamic State group has also claimed attacks. The northern region remains under Houthi control.\n\nOn Sunday, Mwatana, one of Yemen\u2019s top human rights groups, released a documentary on civilian victims of drone strikes, interviewing family members who say their relatives were innocent and have had no compensation from the U.S. despite their wrongful deaths.\n\nIt cited much higher civilian death tolls than the U.S. intelligence report, saying that hundreds of innocents had been killed by the U.S. strikes across the country since at least 2002.\n\nIn one segment from Bayda, the same province where Saturday\u2019s drone strikes hit, Ali Abedrabbo Ahmed said his 17-year old son was only a simple construction worker killed while he was going to work in a pickup truck with colleagues in 2014, an incident other witnesses corroborated in the video.\n\n\u201cWho do we talk to? America? Where is America?\u201d said Nasser Mohammed Nasser, a survivor from the targeted convoy. \u201cThey would kill two or three from al Qaeda on one hand and 10 or 15 civilians on the other hand.

Perez\u2019s flight out of D.C., where he is in graduate school, was canceled, so he said he\u2019s going to try again Sunday or Monday. \u201cMy family has a Christmas party ... and I was hoping to make it to that tonight, but that\u2019s not going to happen anymore,\u201d the 23-year-old said. In Indianapolis, Indiana State Patrol troopers responded to more than 380 property damage crashes from 10 p.m. Friday to 2 p.m. Saturday, CBS affiliate WTTV reports. Sixty of those crashes involved injuries and two were fatal, state police said.\n\nIn addition, state police reported more than 150 slide-offs and provided help to an additional 150 drivers.\n\nThe roads were so slick that authorities had to move motorists stranded on an overpass with a ladder.\u00a0\n\nIn Ohio, a Columbus woman died Saturday when her car skidded off a slick road, authorities said. In another accident in Baltimore, six people were taken to the hospital after a crash on I-695 involving 15 to 20 vehicles, Baltimore County tweeted. In Nebraska, Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s deputies said one person was killed Friday night when his car slid off an icy road north of Omaha, hit a tree and burst into flames. Temperatures plummeted and people braced for the cold. Temperatures in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were expected to drop to minus-20 degrees overnight. According to the NWS, wind chills will drop to 35-45 below zero overnight Saturday and remain there into Sunday morning, CBS Minnesota reports. People were advised to stay indoors for the weekend.\u00a0\n\nSix inches of snow blanketed the Twin Cities Saturday morning, CBS News\u2019 Jamie Yuccas reported. Officers said there were nearly 500 crashes on Minnesota roads. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe low temperature was expected to reach 4 degrees in Chicago on Sunday.\u00a0\n\nPortions of six states, from Missouri to Mississippi, were under the threat of tornadoes or severe thunderstorms. In Virginia, a Fairfax County fire truck slid off an icy road while responding to a crash, local news media reported. No one was injured. Meanwhile, more than three dozen crashes and a fatality were reported in the northern part of the state, authorities said. Police said a man was found dead on the side of I-495, about a mile from a 23-vehicle crash. It appears the man was involved in the crash and had walked away from disabled vehicle. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the man died. At least three highway deaths Friday in Missouri are being blamed on icy conditions.  The Missouri State Highway Patrol crash reports ay a 13-year-old girl died from injuries suffered in an accident when a tractor-trailer lost control on ice on Interstate 44, striking a Jeep Renegade driven by the girl\u2019s mother. Reports say two men, ages 72 and 56, died in separate accidents when the vehicles they were in went out of control on ice. In Colorado, up to a foot of snow fell in places, snarling traffic. Even weather-hardened locals apparently had trouble driving. \u201cI worked for the fire department for 45 years, and we used to call this highway hockey because people keep bumping into each other,\u201d said Kevin Sweeney, of Brighton, a town about 20 miles northeast of Denver. \u201cI think it\u2019s that first big snow thing.\u201d In North Carolina, police and emergency workers reported more than 100 crashes overnight in Raleigh and Charlotte as the drizzle combined with temperatures below freezing to create dangerous icy patches. Charlotte police reported two people killed in separate fatal crashes early Saturday, although investigators were still trying to figure out if ice caused the wrecks. \n\nIn Tulsa, Oklahoma, a fire caused by gas burners killed an eldery woman, CBS News\u2019 Jamie Yuccas reports.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 22, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.718120574951169, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 844, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.59701911146, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161218060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.50236966824645, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-aides-jennifer-palmieri-kellyanne-conway-harvard/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [560, 896, 2395, 3792]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 553, "scraper_regex": 663}}, "headline": "Top Trump and Clinton aides feud at Harvard forum", "wordcount_as_scraped": 663, "date": "20161202090000", "story_content": "Last Updated Dec 2, 2016 7:42 AM EST\n\nA forum with the top campaign officials from the presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton erupted into a bitter clash at one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious universities Thursday night.\n\nCBS News correspondent Nancy Cordes, who attended the forum, says downcast Clinton operatives were subdued through the first half of the three-hour conversation while Trump officials Kellyanne Conway, Corey Lewandowski, and David Bossie touted their winning strategy.\u00a0\n\nThe breaking point for Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri appeared to come as Bossie, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager, praised the Republican president-elect\u2019s controversial campaign chairman, Steve Bannon. \n\n\u201cThe guy is an unbelievably brilliant strategist who is brilliant, a terrific guy who...\u00a0 has a Harvard pedigree and is getting attacked by people who have no idea who he is,\u201d Bossie enthused.\n\n\u201cIf providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant strategist, a brilliant tactician, I am glad to have lost,\u201d Palmieri burst out, adding that she \u201cwould rather lose than win the way you guys did.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t, that\u2019s very clear today,\u201d Conway retorted. \u201cNo you wouldn\u2019t, respectfully.\u201d\n\nBut Conway was just getting started. \n\n\u201cHow exactly did [Mr. Trump] win? No, go for it, Jen -- how exactly did we win? I\u2019d like to know, because I sacrificed the last four months of my life to do it,\u201d she said, arguing they had achieved victory \u201cby looking at the schedule and looking at, yes, the electoral map of 270 because that\u2019s how you win the presidency. And we went places, and we were either ignored or mocked -- roundly by most of the people in this room -- but I have a smile on my face at all times -- and we did it by focusing with Steve Bannon and Dave Bossie and everybody you see here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe connected with voters,\u201d Conway told Palmieri. \u201cWe connected with voters.\u201d\n\nSince 1972, The Kennedy School at Harvard University\u2019s Institute of Politics has held a quadrennial conference on the presidential campaign, which it likes to call a \u201cfirst draft of history\u201d of the presidential campaign that has just taken place. It includes campaign officials, as well as journalists and political observers, and they talk about key decisions and pivotal moments in the campaign.\u00a0\n\nOne of those moments was the hiring of Bannon, the publisher of Breitbart, and an ardent Trump supporter even before he was hired by Mr. Trump to chair his campaign. He was supposed to attend the forum, but skipped it.\n\nPalmieri attacked Bannon for having said that he\u2019d give a platform to white rights activists who refer to themselves as the \u201calt-right,\u201d and she defended Clinton for having delivered a speech accusing Mr. Trump of bringing white nationalists into the mainstream.\n\n\u201cOne of my proudest moments of [Clinton] is her standing up and her saying with courage and clarity in Steve Bannon\u2019s own words, in Donald Trump\u2019s own words, the platform that they gave to white supremacists, white nationalists... it is a very, very important moment in our history as a country, and I think as his presidency moves forward I am going to be very proud to have been part of the campaign that tried to stop it,\u201d Palmieri said.\n\n\u201cDo you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?\u201d Conway asked. \u201cAre you going to look me in the face and tell me that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did, Kellyanne,\u201d said Palmieri. \u201cYou did!\u201d\n\nConway responded, \u201cDo you think you could have just had a decent message for white, working-class voters? You think this woman who has nothing in common with anybody?\u201d Hillary Clinton, Conway said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t connect with people,\u201d and she added, \u201cyou had no economic message.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThere were early signs that the conference was not going to proceed as it had in years past, even outside the building, as hundreds of students protested, specifically against Steve Bannon.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.32669985294342, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 553, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.655554777357, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 5, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.9041591320072329, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.45454545454499995}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-inauguration-young-women-messages-president-elect/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [71, 523, 715, 1257, 5356]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 881, "scraper_regex": 979}}, "headline": "Trump's inauguration sparks action, hope among young Hillary supporters", "wordcount_as_scraped": 979, "date": "20170116230000", "story_content": "\u00a0As a 16-year-old, Zora Ilunga-Reed wasn\u2019t able to vote in the 2016 election, so when President-elect Donald Trump won, she felt powerless -- like she had no voice, she said.\n\n\u201cI was studying in D.C. and [the results] seemed like such a surprise to not only me, but everyone in my community,\u201d she told CBS News. \n\nThe election results made her feel like she was living in a liberal bubble, she added. That\u2019s what inspired her to go to the inauguration.\u00a0\n\nIlunga-Reed said throughout much of the election cycle, she has been surrounded by people who voted for Hillary Clinton, from her parents to her peers to people in her Manhattan community. \u00a0\u201cI want to hear the voices of people who support this man,\u201d she said. With about 800,000 to 900,000 people expected to attend the inauguration, according to officials, Ilunga-Reed hopes she\u2019ll be able to meet some of the people who voted for him and broaden her perspective.\n\n\u201cI am excited about the next four years, and also nervous,\u201d Ilunga-Reed said. \u201cI\u2019m excited because I think there is a lot to learn from this.

I\u2019ve only grown up with President Obama.\u201d\n\nAs a biracial woman, \u00a0Ilunga-Reed said Mr. Obama was more to her than just the president.

But when you\u2019re running a country, it\u2019s not just your family, it\u2019s millions of other families.\u201d\n\nZaniya Lewis is worried about inauguration day. She\u2019s an African American woman, her brother has a disability and her sister serves in the military. She said it feels like her family has been directly targeted by the president-elect\u2019s messages while he was on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cI feel like I have a lot at stake because of what Trump said,\u201d she said.\n\nThis was the first time the 19-year-old voted and she chose Hillary Clinton on Election Day. She felt devastated when Clinton lost and was nervous about going back to class the next day at her D.C. school because she said her college is pretty conservative. \n\nWhen she was back at school many of her peers were celebrating Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cEveryone was cheering and on the flip side there were so many people I knew who were crying. It felt like a war after the election. It was scary for me,\u201d she said.\n\nNow that the inauguration is days away, Lewis says she wants to be more involved in her community. She\u2019s planning on going to the Women\u2019s March on January 21, the day after the inauguration, joining thousands of others who are expected to attend .\n\n\u201cI think it will be a healing process for me as well. I think this march will help me heal and understand that my voice does matter,\u201d Lewis said. \n\nAfter President Obama\u2019s farewell address in Chicago, Lewis says she was inspired to do something meaningful. \u201cI think President Obama passed the baton to the American youth in his farewell speech when he said for us to not lose hope in the democratic process and to be involved,\u201d she said.\n\nDHS chief says \u201cno specific credible threat\u201d for Inauguration\n\nAlthough she was anxious when Mr. Trump won the election, she feels like his victory also helped bring people together, in a way.\n\n\u201cTrump winning the election really brought people to feel like they should go out there and change the world. In a way, he sparked some kind of action,\u201d she said.\n\nLike many young people on the eve of the election, Jilly Towson went to sleep thinking Hillary Clinton would win. When she woke up the next day, she says the world felt like it had flipped upside down.\n\nAs a 16-year-old, she felt like this election was taken away from her because she wasn\u2019t allowed to vote. \u201cIt affects my future more because I\u2019m younger, probably younger than some of his supporters,\u201d she said.\n\nTowson goes to a majority black high school and she says no-one seemed happy when Mr. Trump won the election. When she found out there was a women\u2019s march, she felt a bit better. In fact, she felt relieved. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to change anything I think, I think it\u2019s a place to feel better,\u201d she said. \n\nThe event is going to be a family affair. Towson is going with her sister, who is coming down from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and her mother, too.\n\nTowson says she hopes she\u2019ll meet people at the march who she can look up to as a role model, something she says she doesn\u2019t feel with Mr. Trump. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he knows how many people look up to the president and go to you, not just Americans, but people from other country,\u201d she said. \n\nBut she hopes he\u2019ll constantly be thinking about the American people during his time in office. \n\n\u201cI want him to think about minorities as people, think about their families and their lives here.

Wearable gadgets gave a Stanford University professor an early warning that he was getting sick before he ever felt any symptoms of Lyme disease.\n\nGeneticist Michael Snyder never had Lyme\u2019s characteristic bulls-eye rash. But a smart watch and other sensors charted changes in Snyder\u2019s heart rate and oxygen levels during a family vacation. Eventually a fever struck that led to his diagnosis.\n\nSay \u201cwearables,\u201d and step-counting fitness trackers spring to mind. It\u2019s not clear if they really make a difference in users\u2019 health. Now Snyder\u2019s team at Stanford is starting to find out, tracking the everyday lives of several dozen volunteers wearing devices that monitor more than mere activity.\n\nHe envisions one day having wearables that act as a sort of \u201ccheck engine\u201d light indicating it\u2019s time to see the doctor.\n\n\u201cOne way to look at this is, these are the equivalent of oral thermometers but you\u2019re measuring yourself all the time,\u201d said Snyder, senior author of a report released Thursday on the project.\n\nAmong the earliest hints: Changes in people\u2019s day-to-day physiology may flag when certain ailments are brewing, from colds to Lyme to Type 2 diabetes, researchers reported in the journal PLOS Biology.\n\nInterest in wearable sensors is growing along with efforts to personalize medicine, as scientists learn how to tailor treatments and preventive care to people\u2019s genes, environment and lifestyle. The sensors are expected to be a part of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s huge \u201cprecision medicine\u201d study, planned to begin later this year.\n\nBut a first step is learning what\u2019s normal for different people under different conditions.\n\nThe Stanford team is collecting reams of data -- as many as 250,000 daily measurements -- from volunteers who wear up to eight activity monitors or other sensors of varying sizes that measure heart rate, blood oxygen, skin temperature, sleep, calories expended, exercise and even exposure to radiation. That\u2019s paired with occasional laboratory tests to measure blood chemistry and some genetic information.\n\nAn initial finding: Blood oxygen levels decrease with rising altitudes during plane flights, in turn triggering fatigue. But toward the end of long flights, oxygen begins rising again, possibly as bodies adapt, the researchers reported.\n\nIt was that phenomenon that alerted Snyder, the longest-tested participant, \u201cthat something wasn\u2019t quite right\u201d on one of his frequent long flights.\n\nLanding in Norway for a family vacation, Snyder noticed his oxygen levels didn\u2019t return to normal like they always had before. Plus his heart rate was much higher than normal, which sometimes signals infection.\n\nSure enough, soon a low-grade fever left him dragging. He feared Lyme because two weeks before going abroad, Snyder had helped his brother build a fence in a tick-infested rural area in Massachusetts. He persuaded a Norwegian doctor to prescribe the appropriate antibiotic, and post-vacation testing back home confirmed the diagnosis.\n\nAlso during the study\u2019s first two years, Snyder and several other volunteers had minor cold-like illnesses that began with higher-than-normal readings for heart rate and skin temperature -- and correlated with blood tests showing inflammation was on the rise before any sniffling.\n\nIn addition, the Stanford team detected variations in heart rate patterns that could tell the difference between study participants with what\u2019s called insulin resistance -- a risk factor for Type 2 diabetes -- and healthy people.\n\nNo, don\u2019t try to self-diagnose with your fitness tracker any time soon. The findings in Thursday\u2019s report are intriguing but the study is highly experimental, cautioned medical technology specialist Dr. Atul Butte of the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.\n\n\u201cThis kind of approach is going to help science more than the general public\u201d until there\u2019s better data about what\u2019s normal or not, Butte said. \u201cRemember, the baseline is always in motion. We\u2019re always getting older. We\u2019re always exposed to things. Just because there\u2019s a deviation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s abnormal.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.7341040372848502, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 631, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.86904251601, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.37717908082409, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/good-cholesterol-hdl-heart-health/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [219, 508, 520, 967, 1389]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 702, "scraper_regex": 764}}, "headline": "What you need to know about \"good\" cholesterol", "wordcount_as_scraped": 764, "date": "20161102160000", "story_content": "\u201cBad\u201d LDL cholesterol has long been associated with heart disease risk and doctors prescribe statins and other treatments to lower it when someone\u2019s LDL levels are too high.\u00a0\n\nAiming for high levels of \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol looked like it might be another way to keep heart disease in check, but a new study suggests HDL is more complex than once thought. The findings, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, suggest that for most people, the HDL\u00a0cholesterol\u00a0number isn\u2019t a good indicator of heart health.\n\nSeveral recent randomized clinical trials tested whether raising people\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol levels would cut the risk of heart disease, and found that it didn\u2019t actually help. So researchers led by Dr. Dennis Ko, a senior scientist at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Ontario, Canada, decided to take advantage of \u201cbig data\u201d to try to learn more about HDL\u2019s role in heart disease.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe wanted to look at HDL because it\u2019s been controversial. How come none of the drugs work?\u201d said Ko, who is also an interventional cardiologist at Schulich Heart Centre at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.\n\nThey looked at information pulled from a large population in Ontario \u2014 more than 630,000 patients without pre-existing cardiovascular disease, between the ages of 40 and 105. About half were women and half men.\u00a0\n\nThe researchers examined the relationship between HDL cholesterol levels and other cardiac risk factors, existing illnesses, medications that people were taking, and socioeconomic status, among others factors.\n\nThey also compared the HDL levels of healthier people to the HDL levels of people with poorer health habits, such as smoking.\n\nLow levels of \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol were most common in people who were socioeconomically disadvantaged and who had less healthy behaviors, more cardiac risk factors and more medical problems. Ko said that even when they adjusted for unhealthy lifestyle factors, like smoking, lower HDL levels were still associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular-related death and other causes of death, including cancer. \n\nHigh HDL levels were also associated with an increase in non-cardiovascular related deaths, though not heart-related deaths, Ko noted.\n\n\u201cWe thought that the higher it [HDL levels] goes, the lower the outcomes, but in fact, it\u2019s not a straight-line relationship. We saw high mortality in the very high [HDL] levels, too,\u201d said Ko. \u201cThe conventional thinking to strive for as high an HDL level as possible is not as clear as we thought. It\u2019s a marker associated with many things.\u201d\n\nDr. Chip Lavie, medical director of cardiac rehabilitation and prevention and director of the stress testing laboratory at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans, told CBS News there were reasons why high HDL might be associated with more deaths.\n\n\u201cExtremely high HDL is probably related with alcoholism and liver diseases from alcohol and other disorders,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women\u2019s heart health at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said the new research raises questions about whether or not more HDL drug studies make sense at this point.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been studying medications to specifically raise HDL and a lot of these trials really haven\u2019t panned out, and what I think this study was trying to do was to say, is it worth it for us to keep trying to find a medication to increase HDL?\u201d she said.\n\nSteinbaum said HDL cholesterol levels need to be understood in the context of individual patients and within specific population groups \u2014 the way hormone replacement therapy has been studied in women.\n\n\u201cEvery person needs to be looked at for their entire lifestyle and risk factors and other markers for heart disease. Perhaps at this stage, the least important focus should be on altering that HDL,\u201d said Steinbaum.\n\nShe added, \u201cI don\u2019t think we fully understand enough about HDL. We need to figure out the role of HDL in certain populations to see who will benefit the most from it. Based on this study, the focus can\u2019t just be on the HDL when we talk about altering the risks for heart disease.\u201d\n\nStudy author Ko said we need to rethink what \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol tells us about heart disease and health.\n\n\u201cThe message is to think about HDL in the future as much less a direct cardiovascular marker,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a very low level, that is a marker of poor general health. But I\u2019d tell people to de-emphasize the numbers and emphasize doing things such as exercise and not smoking. Focusing on good lifestyle factors is probably more important.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.5839793682098398, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 702, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.1465578727, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 9, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161102160000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 8, "pct_mft_words": 2.99145299145299, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/happiness-aging-seniors-longer-life/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1257, 1985]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 605, "scraper_regex": 662}}, "headline": "Why happier people actually seem to live longer", "wordcount_as_scraped": 662, "date": "20161214210000", "story_content": "\u201cDon\u2019t worry, be happy\u201d is not only a motto for enjoying life, it might actually help older folks live longer, researchers report.\n\nQuestioned three times over five years, seniors in England who consistently said they enjoy life were 24 percent less likely to die during the follow-up period compared with those who reported little joy from their lives.\n\n\u201cPeople who reported enjoying their lives at all three occasions had the lowest mortality over the next six to seven years, while those who said they did not enjoy their lives at any time were the most likely to die,\u201d said study lead author Andrew Steptoe.\n\n\u201cWe cannot draw the conclusion, however, that high levels of subjective well-being are causally linked with good health, since this is an observational study,\u201d added Steptoe.

He said studies have shown that subjective stress is more telling than objectively measured stress.\n\nFor example, heart disease can cause greater stress in some people than in others, which might affect their level of enjoyment.\n\nPeople with greater subjective stress may feel depressed and have a worse immune response, \u201cwhich would impact their health adversely,\u201d Jeste added.\n\n\u201cHappy people\u00a0are likely to take better care of themselves, exercise regularly, avoid unhealthy foods, take their medications regularly and, as a result, they will have better health outcomes,\u201d he explained.\n\nFor the study, Steptoe and his colleagues collected data on more than 9,300 men and women, aged 50 and older, who took part in the English Longitudinal Study of Aging.

Those responding \u201csometimes and often\u201d were categorized as having high enjoyment, the researchers said.\n\nFactors that could influence the results \u2014 such as wealth, education, health issues and depression \u2014 were taken into account, Steptoe said.\n\nAlmost one-quarter of the participants had no enjoyment of life on any occasion. Roughly 20 percent reported high enjoyment once or twice. More than one-third had high enjoyment of life all three times, the study found.\n\nBy 2013, more than 1,300 participants had died. The deceased tended to have reported not enjoying life, with deaths increasing for each report of no enjoyment, the researchers found.\n\nCompared with those who reported no enjoyment, risk of dying from any cause was reduced 17 percent among people who reported enjoying life on two assessments. The risk fell 24 percent in those reporting enjoying life all three times, the findings showed.\n\nMore women than men said they had high enjoyment of life, as did people with partners. Well-educated, richer, younger and employed people were also more likely to report high enjoyment, the study found.\n\nSteptoe acknowledged that the study had limitations. For one thing, serious illness could account for lack of enjoyment and hastened death, although the research team tried to take that into account.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s assessments of their well-being go up and down, so measures taken on a single occasion may be affected by their current situation,\u201d Steptoe said.\n\nSince this study included multiple reports of well-being, it indicates that both the strength and duration of positive feelings is important, he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.740740716457367, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 605, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 0.655554777357, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 5, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.8264462809917359, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.45454545454499995}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/berlin-christmas-market-attack-dinner-companion-arrested-germany/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 562, "scraper_regex": 708}}, "headline": "Berlin Christmas market attacker's dinner companion arrested in Germany", "wordcount_as_scraped": 708, "date": "20170104190000", "story_content": "Last Updated Jan 4, 2017 4:48 PM EST\n\nBERLIN -- An acquaintance of suspected Berlin Christmas market attacker Anis Amri who dined with him the night before the rampage is under investigation for possible participation in planning the attack, German prosecutors said Wednesday. He was arrested, but in a separate case.\n\nThe 26-year-old Tunisian had known Amri since the end of 2015 and the pair ate together at a Berlin restaurant the night before the Dec. 19 attack, said Frauke Koehler, a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors. His quarters at a refugee home were searched on Tuesday.\n\nThe pair\u2019s meeting led prosecutors to believe that the man may have been involved in the attack or at least knew that Amri planned to commit one, Koehler said. She said that \u201ccommunications devices\u201d seized in Tuesday\u2019s search are being evaluated, but federal prosecutors do not currently have enough evidence to seek an arrest warrant against him.\n\nThe man was, however, detained Tuesday in a separate case run by Berlin local prosecutors, Koehler said. Berlin prosecutors said the arrest was for allegedly falsely claiming benefits.\n\nA further search was conducted Tuesday at the home of a one-time roommate of Amri who is being treated as a witness in the case, Koehler said.\n\nAmri, a 24-year-old Tunisian, tried to reach that person on the morning and afternoon of Dec. 19, but it isn\u2019t clear whether they actually spoke, she added.\n\nInvestigators say Amri drove the truck that plowed into a Christmas market in central Berlin. Twelve people were killed - including the truck\u2019s regular driver, whose body was found in the cab after the attack.\n\nKoehler said that the Polish driver apparently was fatally shot before the truck set off for the market from its parking place north of central Berlin. She said investigations have shown \u201cno indications that there was a third person in the cab at the time of the attack.\u201d\n\nGermany on Dec. 21 released a Europe-wide wanted notice for Amri, who used a string of different names and nationalities. He was killed in a shootout Dec. 23 with Italian police in a Milan suburb after they stopped him for a routine identity check.\n\nSurveillance footage from the Zoologischer Garten station, a few minutes\u2019 walk from the Christmas market, appears to show Amri shortly after the attack, Koehler said.\n\nThe pictures \u201csuggest that Amri was aware that he was being recorded by this video camera,\u201d she said. She added that he turned to the camera and showed a \u201ctawhid finger,\u201d or a raised index finger - an Islamic gesture sometimes used by jihadis.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, claimed responsibility for the attack days afterward.\n\nOn Dec. 21, footage from cameras in the Netherlands suggests that he was at the railway station in Nijmegen, Koehler said.\n\nAmri traveled by train from Nijmegen to Amsterdam the same day, then caught a train to Brussels, Dutch prosecutors said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nBelgian authorities said that he spent two hours at the Brussels North station coming from Amsterdam. He then traveled to Italy via France.\n\nBallistics tests \u201cconfirmed 100 percent\u201d that the .22-caliber, German-manufactured handgun, used by Amri to shoot one of the Italian policemen who had stopped him for a security check \u201cwas the same one that was fired in Germany at the Christmas market attack,\u201d said Gianpaolo Zambonini, of the Rome forensic police.\n\nZambonini said investigations are ongoing to determine whether the gun might have been used in other crimes in Italy or elsewhere.\n\nThe bullet that lodged in the wounded policeman\u2019s shoulder was too damaged to be used for comparison, so Italian police ballistics experts used a simulator at a laboratory in Rome to fire another bullet from the gun. Then they compared scratches on the bullet with those found on bullet cartridges recovered in Berlin, police said.\n\nKoehler said investigators are still trying to figure out how Amri got hold of the gun, but that\u2019s difficult because manufacturer Erma went bankrupt at the end of the 1990s, she added.\n\nAmri, who had previously spent time in prison in Italy, arrived in Germany in July 2015.

Returning the next day and finding Grace still alive, Sullivan strangled her, court documents say. They stored her body in cat litter for months, then hacked it up and dumped it in a remote area where hunters found it in October, police said.\n\nIn separate interviews with The Associated Press, the now-grown former foster daughters, all of whom lived with Sara Packer several years before Grace\u2019s rape and murder, said Sara abused her adopted daughter and clearly favored Grace\u2019s biological brother, who was also adopted.\n\n\u201cHer favorite child, and you could see it plain as day, had always been Gracie\u2019s brother,\u201d said Jade Tenezaca, now 27. \u201cShe was more demanding on Gracie to be normal. But Gracie is not normal. Gracie had a learning disability.\u201d\n\nTenezaca recounted an episode that, in hindsight, seems chilling. Sara was watching the TV crime drama \u201cCSI\u201d once and casually mentioned that if she ever killed someone, she\u2019d dismember the body and burn the pieces to ash, Tenezaca said.\n\n\u201cIt kind of freaked me out,\u201d she said.\n\nSara and her husband at the time, David Packer, fostered dozens of children before David was arrested in 2010 and sent to prison for sexually assaulting Grace and a 15-year-old foster daughter at their home in Allentown, about an hour north of Philadelphia.\n\nSara Packer lost her job as an adoptions supervisor for nearby Northampton County in April 2010, and she was barred from taking in any more foster children. But she wasn\u2019t charged with a crime related to her husband\u2019s abuse, and Grace and her brother continued to live in the home.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s child-welfare agency is investigating the circumstances around Grace\u2019s death.\n\nThe abused foster daughter, now 25, told the AP that the sexual abuse by David Packer began when she was 15, shortly after she moved into the home, and went on for years. The AP is withholding the name of the woman because she is a victim of sexual abuse.\n\nDavid moved the woman to a third-floor bedroom near the one he shared with Sara, she said. He would tie her to the bedpost and leave her there all night, she said. He would tie her to a chair and gag her. He dressed her in revealing outfits and made her go on a diet. He sexually abused her.\n\nShe said she felt she had nowhere to turn.\n\n\u201cAfter a while, I just gave up, mentally and physically. What was I supposed to do?\u201d said the woman, adding she twice tried killing herself while living in the home and was hospitalized.\n\nSara Packer, the woman said, had to know about the abuse. Prosecutors say Sara was aware of her husband\u2019s sexual contact with the foster daughter at least by the time the girl became an adult.\n\nThe now-grown foster daughter said she was unaware at the time that David Packer was also allegedly abusing Grace. But, she said, she did see Sara treat Grace horribly.\n\n\u201cSome parts of (Grace\u2019s) brain didn\u2019t work like ours, and you\u2019d have to tell her more than a few times to do things. And Sara didn\u2019t like that. She yelled, she screamed. She hit her. She was just a big bully to her,\u201d the woman said.\n\nSara Packer\u2019s lawyer said he has not yet seen police or child-welfare files from the 2010 investigation of David Packer, and does not have evidence that his client was involved in wrongdoing. He noted she maintained custody of Grace and her brother after David went to prison.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good sign they investigated the family and didn\u2019t pull the kids,\u201d said the lawyer, John Fioravanti Jr. \u201cThat suggests they didn\u2019t think she was involved.\u201d\n\nThe defense team has only just begun to investigate Sara\u2019s life and the criminal charges, Fioravanti said. Her work history in Northampton County - rising from case worker to supervisor over seven years before she was fired amid her husband\u2019s criminal investigation - suggests she was a dedicated child-care worker, he said.\n\nGiven those accomplishments, he said, \u201cit\u2019s just beyond belief that all of a sudden you have this monster.\u201d\n\nSara and David Packer divorced last year.\n\nCrystal Rodack, a third former foster daughter, spent only a few months in the Packer home. But in January 2010, she said, she looked at David Packer\u2019s phone and found photos and videos showing him sexually abusing the other foster daughter. She alerted relatives, who immediately called police.\n\nRodack said she always felt uncomfortable in the home. And, like the other former foster children, she said Grace took a back seat to her brother.\n\n\u201cThey were really mean to Gracie in the home. She was always in trouble,\u201d Rodack said. \u201cThey would hit her, they would ground her and take stuff from her and keep her in her room. I felt bad for her.\u201d\n\nYet the girl remained upbeat, Tenezaca said.\n\n\u201cGracie was never in a bad mood. Gracie was always happy and fun, and she always wanted to be with the girls,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was warm. She would open her heart to anyone and everyone. If you gave her the chance, she would be your best friend.\u201d\n\nTenezaca said she gave birth while still in the Packers\u2019 care. Sara Packer urged her to place the child for adoption, Tenezaca said, with Sara as the adoptive parent. Tenezaca agreed but changed her mind and kept the child.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut something in me said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it, you\u2019re going to regret it.\u2019 And I\u2019m thanking God I never did it.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.73704791069031, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 905, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.44975744746, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.3204419889502796, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/25000-items-need-claiming-fort-lauderdale-airport-shooting/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1547, 1704, 4278]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 723, "scraper_regex": 770}}, "headline": "25,000 items need claiming after Fort Lauderdale airport shooting", "wordcount_as_scraped": 770, "date": "20170108160000", "story_content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Dan and Janice Kovacs and their two children were passing through airport security when the gunfire erupted. They were shoeless - with wallets, passports and carry-on items chugging along a conveyer belt - when they sprang into the mass of people running to safety.\n\nNow they\u2019re among stranded travelers at Fort Lauderdale trying to recover what the airport director says are 25,000 pieces of luggage, cellphones and other belongings separated from their owners during Friday\u2019s airport shooting rampage.\n\n\u201cWe have no IDs, we have no passports, no money,\u201d Janice, 39, said Saturday afternoon, wearing sandals borrowed from a brother-in-law. \u201cWe just had to leave our stuff and run.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll our stuff is being processed. We might not even get that until Monday. I have an 11-year-old who is freaking out. This has been traumatic for her,\u201d she said.\n\nThe shooting Friday afternoon, which killed five people and wounded six, also stranded about 12,000 outgoing and incoming travelers, many returning from cruises or arriving ahead of the usual Saturday departures of the massive ships based in the tourism hub\u2019s Port Everglades terminal.\n\nCBS Miami reports that the airport is finally back in business as tens of thousands of passengers who were stuck are trying to finally make their way back to their destination.\n\nTerminal\u2019s one, three and four were reopened Saturday morning but operational portions of terminal two, where the attack happened, remain closed. \u00a0\n\nAfter 300 cancellations Friday, flights are getting back to normal at the airport but cleanup from the carnage in terminal two\u2019s baggage claim continues. \u00a0\n\nSome travelers were kept on planes for more than seven hours while police put the airport on lockdown; others scrambled to protected corners or were hustled out onto the tarmac. The Kovacs, on the way back from a Caribbean cruise, went out onto that rough surface barefoot.\n\nThe Florida Highway Patrol sent computer-equipped buses to the airport Saturday afternoon to issue temporary ID cards to help travelers get out of state and even abroad. \u201cWe are doing what we can to help,\u201d Sgt. Mark Wysocki said.\n\nSydney Rivera, a 21-year-old Purdue University student, received a temporary Florida identification card that is nearly identical to the state\u2019s driver\u2019s license. On Friday, she had been about to board a flight home to Indianapolis in another terminal when people scattered over false fears of a second shooter.\n\n\u201cThis will make it a lot easier to get through security,\u201d Rivera said as she rushed to finally catch a flight.\n\nGov. Rick Scott said cruise ship companies were asked to accept travelers with provisional IDs. Once authorities began allowing travelers to depart the airport Friday evening, buses took thousands of them to the cruise terminal.\n\nAirport spokesman Greg Meyer said most bags won\u2019t be available until Monday. The airport hired an outside firm to collect discarded bags and sort them by where they were found so they can be identified by their owners. Those with lost luggage were told to call a toll-free number.\n\nRichard Lanbry, his wife and 15-year-old daughter were about to board a plane home for Montreal when the shooting began. Amid the commotion, he was separated from the other two and frantically searched for them for about an hour.\n\n\u201cI was pushed down, my wife was pushed down too. It was violent ... people screaming, people crying, old and young. It was very scary,\u201d said the 61-year-old, who was vacationing in Pompano Beach.\n\nOn top of that, they now have no luggage, no keys to their home and no coats or sweaters to wear once they arrive in chilly Montreal, only the T-shirts they we wearing the day before.\n\nLarry and Joy Edwards were about to board their flight home to Columbus, Ohio, after a Caribbean cruise. They ran out the skyway and down stairs onto the tarmac, where they were told to drop their carry-on bags and dash out to the runway.

Bush. \u201cSo regardless of whatever the president thinks of torture, enhanced interrogation techniques, he can\u2019t implement it without Congress.\u201d \n\nTownsend pointed to the Army Field Manual for a definitive guide. \n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s permitted by the Army Field Manual, it\u2019s legal and you can do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not in the Army Field Manual, it is most likely prohibited by the legislation passed by Congress. And so I think that we should -- to the extent this upsets and worries Americans, our allies around the world \u2013 it\u2019s not legal now and cannot be reinstituted or begun anew without new legislation.\u201d \n\nOn both sides of the aisle, Townsend said there is no support in Congress for the torture tactics. \n\n\u201cNone. None,\u201d she emphasized. \n\nIn the Wednesday interview, Mr. Trump said intelligence officials told him torture works.\n\n\u201cI have spoken as recently as 24 hours ago with people at the highest level of intelligence and I asked them the question: Does it work? Does torture work?\u201d Mr. Trump told\u00a0ABC News. \u201cAnd the answer was yes, absolutely.\u201d\n\nBut he said he would \u201crely\u201d on CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis, who opposes waterboarding, for guidance on the policy. \n\n\u201cI want to do everything within the bounds of what you\u2019re allowed to do legally,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \n\n\u201cBut do I feel it works?\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cAbsolutely, I feel it works.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s administration denied Wednesday that a purported draft of an executive order on U.S. interrogation methods and possible re-opening of CIA-run \u201cblack site\u201d prisons actually originated from the White House. Townsend said with black sites, \u201cyou have to find countries that are willing to host them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the way, there have been lawsuits, there have been governments toppled over having hosted these,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not clear you could even find, if you wanted to go back to it, find countries that\u2019d be willing to host them.\u201d\n\nAs for Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Townsend again highlighted the challenges. \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s clear that the more complicated you make it for people to enter illegally, the more discouraging it is, right? Fewer people will cross. And it is true to say that every nation\u2019s got the right to control its own borders,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I mean, I will tell you in 2006, a decade ago when the law passed by Congress was sort of forced on the Bush administration, President Bush signed it into law, we found it to be very difficult. So we shouldn\u2019t assume that any wall is going to be purely bricks and mortar. You\u2019re going to use technology, you\u2019re going to find ways to discourage people from trying to enter illegally.\u201d\n\nThat also includes increasing the size of border patrol, Townsend said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.59066438674927, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 505, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.25630429927, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.35643564356436, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-expands-pool-of-candidates-for-secretary-of-state/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [514, 2429]}}, "headline": "Trump expands pool of candidates for secretary of state", "wordcount_as_scraped": 655, "date": "20161204220000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON D.C. -- President-elect Donald Trump is expanding his pool of candidates for secretary of state, leaving unclear whether former CIA Director David Petraeus\u2019 guilty plea for leaking classified information disqualifies him to serve as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. \u201cThere\u2019s not a finite list of candidates\u201d for secretary of state, top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters on Sunday. \u201cMore than four. Who knows how many finalists there will be?\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe remark comes a week after Mr. Trump\u2019s aides confirmed that the president-elect had settled on four finalists for the post. Two people close to the transition tell The Associated Press that Mr. Trump is moving away from two of the four: former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. That would leave Petraeus as a top contender, along with Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Both people close to the transition said Mr. Trump\u2019s prolonged decision-making process has left the door open to other options. Among other possibilities, one official says is Jon Huntsman, a former Republican Utah governor who also served as the ambassador to China and speaks Mandarin. The people close to the transition spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private process publicly. There was other evidence that Mr. Trump is looking beyond the known four contenders. Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Sunday listed the quartet, but added a fresh reference to former U.N. ambassador \u201cJohn Bolton or others who may be added to the list\u201d of candidates. \u201cI think the person who will make the decision about our next secretary of state is the president-elect,\u201d Pence said on ABC. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll factor the totality of Gen. Petraeus\u2019 career in making that decision.\u201d Pence also referred to Petraeus as a \u201chero.\u201d But it seemed unclear Sunday even to Petraeus and Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle whether the retired general\u2019s guilty plea has turned off Mr. Trump. Petraeus, a retired four-star general, pleaded guilty last year to one misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information relating to documents he had provided to a woman he was having a sexual relationship with. He was spared prison time under a plea agreement with the Justice Department and was given two years\u2019 probation.\u00a0\n\nFBI Director James Comey has drawn a distinction between Petraeus\u2019 case and that of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by saying there was no evidence that Clinton or her aides had intended to break the law through careless handling of sensitive information. Federal prosecutors said Petraeus knew black binders he shared contained classified information, but he nonetheless provided them. \u201cI made a mistake. I have again acknowledged it,\u201d Petraeus said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u2018\u2019Folks will have to factor that in and determine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not.\u201d The remarks come as Mr. Trump struggles to fill one of the most visible and prestigious positions in any presidential administration. The secretary of state will steer Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda, which the president-elect has said would include renegotiating key trade deals and the pact aimed at keeping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. But for all his business acumen, Mr. Trump has no experience with government diplomacy. He\u2019s most recently drawn criticism for speaking with Taiwan\u2019s leader that contradicted U.S. practice and prompted a complaint from China. Petraeus acknowledged that he loaned Paula Broadwell eight binders containing highly classified information regarding war strategy, intelligence capabilities and identities of covert officers. Petraeus kept the binders in an unlocked desk drawer at his home, instead of a secure facility that\u2019s required for handling classified material. When initially questioned by the FBI, he denied having given Broadwell classified information. Petraeus avoided being charged with making a false statement under his plea deal. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t think it was false,\u201d Petraeus said Sunday.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.0771512985229497, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 625, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.935966376453, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 9, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161204220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.44, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.8181818181820001}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/snow-pounds-parts-of-east-coast-spares-several-big-cities/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [325, 785, 942, 1238, 1571, 2147, 2352, 2524, 2893, 3003, 3168, 3893, 4230, 4584, 5065, 5327, 5443, 5606, 5607, 6071, 6269, 6348]}}, "headline": "Snow pounds parts of East Coast, spares several big cities", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1056, "date": "20170108010000", "story_content": "DURHAM, N.C. -- Snow and sleet pounded a large swath of the U.S. East Coast on Saturday, coating roads with ice and causing hundreds of crashes. Thousands of people lost power and forecasters warned of blizzard-like conditions from Virginia to parts of the Northeast.\u00a0\n\nPolice investigated several fatal crashes as potentially storm-related, but some of the South\u2019s biggest cities - Atlanta, Charlotte and Raleigh - appeared to avoid the worst of the storm. Authorities praised residents for learning the lessons of past storms that resulted in icy gridlock, where thousands of people were stranded along the interstates. But officials warned that bitter cold would keep roads treacherous well after the snow and sleet stopped.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf I tell you anything it would be stay home,\u201d North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said. \u201cDo not go out and drive on the roads unless you absolutely have to.\u201d\u00a0\n\nCooper was supposed to have been sworn in Saturday at an outdoor ceremony attended by thousands. He instead rushed through a 20-minute indoor oath-taking Friday.  \u201cConsider yourselves the chosen few,\u201d Cooper jokingly told family, friends and well-wishers able to attend his swearing-in Friday.\u00a0\n\nOn Saturday he said there were at least 260 traffic accidents between midnight and 6 a.m. as the winter storm blew in. Authorities say they haven\u2019t confirmed any weather-related deaths. Cooper said that even after precipitation is expected to stop later in the day, bitter cold will blow in and refreeze any melted slush on roads.\u00a0\n\nA National Weather Service map showed the snowfall seemed to follow the Interstate 85 corridor through the state, with locations along and north of the highway receiving snow, and areas to the south getting rain and sleet. Burlington and Roxboro in central North Carolina received 8 inches or more of snow. Preliminary figures from the National Weather Service in Greer, South Carolina, showed snowfall totals reached up to 10 inches in at least seven locations, including Greensboro and High Point, Lewisville in Forsyth County, and Lenoir and Rhodhiss in Caldwell County.\u00a0\n\nPower outages had grown to about 25,000 in North Carolina alone, according to a news release from the governor. Nearly half were in the Charlotte area and adjacent Union County, according to Duke Power.\u00a0\n\nRoads were also treacherous. The South Carolina Highway Patrol said there was significant snow on roads in the northern part of the state and asked drivers to stay home.\u00a0\n\nSeveral inches also fell in southeast Virginia, where a blizzard warning was issued for the cities along the coast. Virginia State Police said they responded to 325 crashes and 322 disabled vehicles across the state between midnight and noon on Saturday. The National Weather Service had already measured nearly 6 inches of snow at its post in Wakefield on Saturday.\u00a0\n\nEven with snow coating Virginia Beach roads, diners and staff made it to the popular breakfast spot Citrus.\u00a0\u201cWhen there\u2019s bad weather, people come out,\u201d manager Tara Junke said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in restaurants for 20 years in Hampton Roads and we\u2019ve never shut down for snow.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn Tennessee, hundreds of crashes were reported starting Friday. From Atlanta to airports farther north, hundreds of flights were canceled.\n\nAt least one fatality - a man whose pickup truck went off a snow-slickened Kentucky road Thursday - has been blamed on the weather. Motorist deaths in North Carolina and Maryland as the storm blew in were being investigated to see if they were caused by the weather. In Atlanta and parts of Georgia, people who were expecting a couple of inches of snow instead woke up to a thin coat of ice. The National Weather Service said a wind chill advisory for northern Georgia was to go into effect later Saturday into Sunday.  Residents should brace for bitterly cold air and strong wind.\u00a0\n\nTraffic was barely crawling across parts of central Mississippi on Saturday morning, with 18-wheel trucks pulled over on the shoulders of icy highways in spots. Jackson\u2019s city streets were supposed to be filled with runners Saturday, but organizers canceled the annual Mississippi Blues Marathon, citing weather and travel conditions.\u00a0\n\nDrivers struggled to make it up hills in some places, including an off-ramp from an interstate leading to two of Jackson\u2019s largest hospitals. The Mississippi Department of Transportation advised people to stay off roads, saying Friday night that it was focusing on getting stranded motorists to safety. Hours of sleet coated parts of the state Friday.\u00a0\n\nIt was unclear when conditions would improve, as temperatures were supposed to remain below freezing until midday Sunday in Jackson.\t\n\nThe conditions affected air travel across several states.\n\nIn Virginia, most flights were canceled at Norfolk\u2019s airport because of the winter storm, the latest disruption to hit airports in the region. The website for Norfolk International Airport showed that every arriving flight was canceled for Saturday, as well as most departing flights.\u00a0\n\nIn North Carolina, Raleigh\u2019s airport said there were many cancellations and it expected very few flights to arrive or depart on Saturday. Charlotte\u2019s airport also said its operations were limited. It advised travelers to check their carrier for cancellations.\u00a0\n\nAtlanta\u2019s airport said that some flights have been canceled but that regular takeoffs and landings were resuming.\u00a0\n\nIn the Northeast, officials at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport urged travelers to check with their airlines and numerous flights were canceled or delayed. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nA crash involving as many as 20 vehicles closed a section of a Connecticut highway as heavy snow fell in southern New England.\n\nThe pileup on Interstate 91 in Middletown occurred Saturday afternoon and involved at least three tractor-trailers. No serious injuries were reported.\t\n\nUp to 8 inches of snow were expected in parts of Connecticut, but areas along the southeastern Massachusetts coast could get 1 to 2 feet before the storm moves away later Saturday.\u00a0\n\nBlizzard conditions were reported on Cape Cod and Plymouth County. Officials warned people to stay off the roads as the heavy snow and gusty winds were expected to reduce visibility to near zero.\u00a0\n\nMid-morning Saturday, snow began falling from New York City and points east.\u00a0\n\nPredictions are for New York\u2019s Nassau County to see about 4-to-6 inches. Snow totals could reach 8-to-12 inches further east. Wind gusts could reach 25 to 30 mph.

Since DeGraw travels for a living, the artist thought it was a natural fit.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the benefit of someone like Brian,\u201d DeGraw told CBS News. \u201cYou gotta know somebody who can figure out the system, and he\u2019s figured out a way to do it, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nDeGraw broke out his new single \u201cShe Sets The City On Fire\u201d on stage, but soon returned to his roots, ending his performance with the classic \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To Be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis song changed meaning for me over time. When I wrote this song I was upset because I was broke. I didn\u2019t really have a gig. It was hard time for me,\u201d DeGraw said on stage. \u201cSo I wrote this song because I was upset. Then somehow this song became a hit song and I wasn\u2019t upset anymore. It\u2019s funny how that works. I still sing it like I\u2019m angry, but I\u2019m just not angry anymore.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what DeGraw had to say about his hectic travel schedule, his decade-long music career, how he\u2019s spending the holidays and more.\n\nTell me a little bit about how you ended up performing here on the Intrepid tonight, and how you\u2019re collaborating with The Point\u2019s Guy, including the founder of the company, Brian Kelly.\n\nI travel for a living. They thought it was a natural fit. With the amount of hotels we stay at and the amount of flights that we take...when we can\u2019t take our tour bus somewhere we end up having to finagle as many points as we possibly can from all the expenses that we rack up over the course of our career. Finding the most appropriate way to take advantage of all that stuff. You\u2019re looking to a system like Brian\u2019s to make the best of your situation. How do we hook it up? That\u2019s the benefit of someone like Brian. You gotta know somebody who can figure out the system, and he\u2019s figured out a way to do it, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\n\nYou\u2019ve been traveling a lot. You\u2019ve been on tour \u2014 a different state almost every night \u2014 does that get exhausting?\n\nI\u2019ve been on tour for the last few months with a good friend of mine named Andy Grammer. We\u2019ve hit a bunch of cities in the United States in last couple months, performing with Shania Twian and Billy Joel, so really it\u2019s been a whirlwind of cities and miles and points. That\u2019s where it all kind of ties in together.\n\nYou\u2019re from New York (South Fallsburg, New York, to be precise). What\u2019s it like being back here?\n\nI carved my teeth here in New York City with my music career. It\u2019s kind of cool to come back here. I literally drove down my old street on my way over here from where my first apartment was where me and my brother lived together. It was small. This was like a box and it was a one bedroom; it was a very small one bedroom. My brother and I, we shared a bedroom. We had a very tiny living area and across the street was a school that I think, uhm, I think they were getting the kids ready to go to prison. It was like a rough school. When my brother moved to another place I kept that one and then I ended up living in that place with three other people. So it was like 4 of us in a one bedroom. It was rough. We were roughing it.\u00a0\n\nMusic has now been your career for more than a decade. What\u2019s it like thinking back on where you started to where you are now?\n\nI was literally having a trip down memory lane on the drive over here. I drove past the cafe I used to sit in with my notepad and write songs. I used to sit on the corner. It used to be a coffee shop and now it\u2019s a bar \u2014 on 49th and 9th. I was literally having a trip down memory lane. It was kind of blowing me away thinking, \u2018Oh, wow, I\u2019m actually going to play at the Intrepid, the museum.\u2019\u201d I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever played here before. I\u2019ve walked on here before, like I said, on a third grade field trip and I think I came here again when I was about 22 i walked on here I think I came to just look at it as an adult to kind of take it in again. But this is kind of more special for me, you know.\n\nI\u2019ve heard you say that your new album, Something Worth Saving, doesn\u2019t really have a theme. You\u2019re not one for themes. What songs on this album differ from your past albums?\n\nI don\u2019t have the attention span for that. Hopefully there are improvements upon the stuff I\u2019ve been doing. Ever since I\u2019ve put my first record out I\u2019ve always been trying to outdo whatever that was. But before I even put my first record out I was just writing song after song after song trying to beat the last song. You\u2019re always trying to beat the last song as a songwriter.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m looking at it more and more and more as a guy who grew up in New York than I ever used to think about it. I know a lot more about New York than most people so maybe I should really be writing more New York specific material. To give people a little bit of almost like a window into life as a New Yorker, not just life as me, Gavin DeGraw, but life as a New Yorker \u2014 what it\u2019s like to be a New Yorker. That\u2019s been crossing my mind. Stories that I could tell that would be very specific to this place that you would only know if you were here just to bring the listener into your world.

I\u2019m definitely doing a lot of traveling for the holidays. We\u2019re going to be in so many cities over the next few weeks. We\u2019ve been doing a lot of radio shows for the holidays. We\u2019ll just literally be hopping on plane to plane to plane and hotel to hotel and I\u2019ll be looking for something that feels better than home. Do you know what I mean? You always want something that you couldn\u2019t even get at home.\u00a0\n\nWatch a portion of DeGraw\u2019s performance at the Intrepid in the video below.\n\nGetting up close and personal with Gavin DeGraw.

Three people were killed near San Francisco.\n\nJust north, the Russian River topped its banks today forced evacuations. Crews are worried that trees weakened by drought may come down, CBS News\u2019 Carter Evans reported.\u00a0\n\nEmergency crews in rescue boats and helicopters rushed to take advantage of a one-day break between storms Monday to rescue stranded people and assess damage after the heaviest rain in a decade overwhelmed parts of California and Nevada. A weekend storm dumped more than a foot of water on parts of Northern California, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate and leaving thousands without power. The system raised rivers out of their banks and toppled trees, among them the fabled giant sequoia dubbed \u201cPioneer Cabin\u201d that had a tunnel carved into its base more than a century ago. Another strong storm was bearing down on the region for Tuesday. Such gaps between storms are \u201cwhat saves us from the big water,\u201d Fire Chief Max Ming said in the Russian River town of Forestville, where rescuers launched rafts and used a helicopter to search for people cut off by rising water. \u201cPeople hunker down and wait for it to get past.\u201d The back-to-back storms that have hit California and Nevada since last week are part of an \u201catmospheric river\u201d weather system that draws precipitation from the Pacific Ocean as far west as Hawaii. That kind of system, also known as the \u201cpineapple express,\u201d poses catastrophic risks for areas hit by the heaviest rain. \u201cIt\u2019s been about 10 years since we\u2019ve experienced this kind of rainfall,\u201d said Steve Anderson, a National Weather Service forecaster. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a little bit of a break today, but we have another storm system arriving tomorrow that\u2019s not quite as potent but could still cause problems.\u201d\u00a0\n\nParts of California\u2019s wine country in Sonoma County were among the hardest hit, with up to 13 inches of rain since Friday, Anderson said. The Russian River in Sonoma rose to its highest level since 2006, spilling over its banks and into vineyards and oak groves.  Schools and roads were forced to close across the area. Avalanche concerns kept some California ski areas closed for a second day Monday in the Sierra Nevada. Forecasters said more snow and rain was on the way. The Russian River is prone to flooding, but this year\u2019s flood has been particularly worrisome because it threatened to topple trees weakened by six years of drought. A flood warning for the Russian River was in effect, along with a high wind watch planned for Tuesday afternoon through Tuesday evening, Anderson said.\u00a0\n\nJeff Watts, an artist, spent an anxious night listening for the sound of falling trees on his property in Forestville. On Monday, he found his drive to work blocked by a car that had slammed into a tree that had fallen across the road. Emergency crews worked to extract the vehicle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get past the tree, so I turned around and I\u2019m doing this,\u201d said Watts, who had pulled over to photograph oak trees and their reflections in the floodwater. Yosemite National Park will reopen the valley floor to visitors Tuesday morning after it was closed through the weekend and Monday because of a storm-swollen river, park spokesman Scott Gediman said. He said guests will be allowed back in starting at 8 a.m. for day visitors. Park workers were checking the extent of damage from the storm to water and sewer systems, he said.\u00a0\n\nOver the weekend, toppled trees also crashed against cars and homes and blocked roads in the San Francisco Bay Area. Stranded motorists had to be rescued from cars stuck on flooded roads. The city itself got just over 2 inches of rain. A giant tree fell across a highway in Hillsborough to the south of San Francisco, injuring a driver who could not stop in time and drove into the tree. And a woman was killed Saturday by a falling tree while she took a walk on a golf course. To the south near Los Angeles, commuters were warned of possible highway flooding and mudslides in hilly areas.\u00a0\n\nMudslides kept road crews busy on the Pacific Coast Highway and Interstate 80, \u00a0where it took Dave Wood and his crew 10 hours to clear the mess. \u201cIt (mudslide)was five feet deep 80 feet wide and a 1,000 feet long,\u201d Wood told Evans.\u00a0\n\nEmergency workers in Nevada voluntarily evacuated about 1,300 people from 400 homes in a Reno neighborhood as the Truckee River overflowed and drainage ditches backed up. Winter storm warnings were in effect in the Sierra Nevada until Thursday morning, with the potential for blizzard and white-out conditions, said Scott McGuire, a forecaster for the National Weather Service based in Reno. \u201cPeople need to avoid traveling if at all possible,\u201d McGuire said. Four to 8 feet of snow are forecast through Thursday above 7,000 feet, and the Lake Tahoe area could get between 2 to 5 feet of snow, he said. Schools were canceled Monday in Reno and Sparks, and Gov. Brian Sandoval told all nonessential state government workers to stay home Monday after he declared a state of emergency.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 24, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.30896997451782, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 868, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.880322883060001, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.2258064516129, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/highlights-from-donald-trumps-press-conference/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [402, 3115, 3444, 7197]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1112, "scraper_regex": 1295}}, "headline": "Highlights from Donald Trump's press conference", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1295, "date": "20170111190000", "story_content": "Last Updated Jan 11, 2017 11:20 PM EST\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump held a free-wheeling, hour-long press conference at Trump Tower Wednesday morning -- the first formal press conference he\u2019s held since winning the presidency in November.\n\nIn a tweet hours later, Mr. Trump described the press conference as \u201cgreat,\u201d but also slammed \u201cfake news\u201d outlets.\u00a0\n\nWe had a great News Conference at Trump Tower today. A couple of FAKE NEWS organizations were there but the people truly get what's going on\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017\n\nThough the motivation for the news conference was to outline how he will deal with his complex web of business interests once he\u2019s in the White House, much of the press conference ended up focusing on Russian election interference and on reports Tuesday that the intelligence community\u2019s classified report on Russian hacking had an addendum with unverified details of potentially compromising information that Russia has gathered on the president-elect, and that Mr. Trump was briefed on last week.\n\nHere are some of the highlights: \n\nMr. Trump said he\u2019s not allowed to discuss information that was presented during his intelligence briefing -- but confirmed that outside the briefing, he did in fact see the memo in question on compromising information, calling it a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw the information, I read the information outside of that meeting. It\u2019s all fake news -- it\u2019s phony stuff, it didn\u2019t happen and it was gotten by opponents of ours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a group of opponents who got together -- sick people -- and they put that crap together.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he accepts the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Russia actively worked to influence the 2016 election, Mr. Trump said he believes Russia was responsible for the hacking -- but stopped short of saying he believed they had an influence on the campaign.\n\n\u201cAs far as hacking, I think it was Russian,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people and I can say that when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that, that was something that was extraordinary.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had a message for Putin about future hacking activities, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be doing it, he won\u2019t be doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia will have much greater respect for our country when I\u2019m leading it than when other people have led it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see that.\u201d\n\nHe said he considers Putin\u2019s praise of him to be \u201can asset, not a liability,\u201d though he doesn\u2019t yet know whether he and Putin will \u201cget along.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to get along with Vladimir Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I do, but \u2026 do you honestly believe that Hillary [Clinton] will be tougher on Putin than me?\u201d\n\nThough Mr. Trump asserted that he would have been able to continue running his business from the White House if he wanted to, he said his two sons, Eric and Donald Jr., along with Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, would take over his businesses while he\u2019s president.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI could actually run my business ... and run government at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way that looks but I\u2019d be able to if I wanted to.\u201d\n\nThe stacks of manila folders on the table next to Mr. Trump at the podium were, he said, \u201csome of the many documents I\u2019ve signed turning over complete and total control.\u201d \u00a0\n\nMr. Trump introduced Sherri Dillon of Morgan Lewis, a lawyer who has been working on the plan for the Trump business empire.\n\nDillon said Mr. Trump\u2019s business holdings and investments will be put in a trust before Inauguration Day to be overseen by sons Donald Jr. and Eric, and Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. Mr. Trump also said that his two adult sons will run the company. Ivanka Trump, whose husband Jared Kushner is set to become a senior adviser to the Trump White House, will have \u201cno further management\u201d role in the company.\n\nThere will be \u201cno new foreign deals\u201d made during the duration of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, Dillon added, and domestic deals will be subject to \u201csevere restrictions.\u201d\n\nTo people who suggest Mr. Trump should sell his business, Dillon said that would only \u201cexacerbate\u201d the possibility for conflicts.\n\nAdditionally, in order to ensure that \u201cit is the American people who will profit\u201d going forward, Mr. Trump has directed that all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels will be donated to the U.S. Treasury.\u201d\n\nAt the start of the press conference, Mr. Trump thanked news organizations that did not run stories on Russia\u2019s alleged compromising information about him.\n\n\u201cI want to thank a lot of the news organizations, some of whom have not treated me well over the years, a couple in particular, and they came out so strongly against that fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cI have great respect for the news, I have great respect for freedom of the press and all of that, but I will tell you there were some news organizations \u2026 that were so professional, so incredibly professional.\u201d\n\nLater on, he called BuzzFeed, which posted a document which it says is the dossier about the Russian information, \u201ca failing pile of garbage,\u201d and also criticized CNN for publicizing the reports on Tuesday.\n\nCNN reporter Jim Acosta attempted to ask a follow-up question, but Mr. Trump repeatedly shut him down. \n\n\u201cNo, not you, your organization is terrible. Quiet. Quiet,\u201d he said. As Acosta continued trying to ask a question, talking over another reporter, Mr. Trump continued: \u201cDon\u2019t be rude. Don\u2019t be rude. Don\u2019t. Be. Rude. I\u2019m not going to give you a question. You are fake news.\u201d\n\nAfter the exchange, he called on CNN digital reporter Jeremy Diamond, CBS News\u2019 Arden Farhi noted.\n\nOn a question about his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Mr. Trump said Mexico will \u201creimburse\u201d the U.S. for the wall because he doesn\u2019t want to wait to build it until a deal can be made with Mexico.\n\n\u201cI want to get the wall started,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait a year and a half until I make my deal with Mexico.\u201d\n\nAs for the form that reimbursement will take, Mr. Trump said it\u2019s more likely it will be through a \u201ctax\u201d than a \u201cpayment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will reimburse us for the cost of the wall, whether it\u2019s a tax or whether it\u2019s a payment,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably less likely that it\u2019s a payment.\u201d\n\nIn response to a question from CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett, Mr. Trump said he plans to announce his pick to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia \u201cwithin two weeks\u201d of taking office.\n\n\u201cThat will be probably within two weeks of the 20th,\u201d he said. \u201cSo within about two weeks, probably the second week.\u201d\n\nAsked to discuss his administration\u2019s plan for dealing with the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump declined to give any specifics but said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get health care taken care of in this country.\u201d\n\nHe did say, however, that the ACA would be replaced \u201cessentially simultaneously\u201d with something \u201cfar less expensive and far better.\u201d As soon as his health and human services secretary nominee, Rep. Tom Price, is confirmed, Mr. Trump told reporters \u201cwe\u2019ll be submitting a plan\u201d to repeal and replace Obamacare.\u00a0\n\n\u201cObamacare is a complete and total disaster,\u201d he said, citing increased premiums and high deductibles. \u201c...Frankly, we could sit back -- and it was a thought from a political standpoint -- but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the people.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.27897679805756, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1112, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.35312347374, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.0683453237410103, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/privacy-board-in-disarray-before-trump-takes-office/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [69]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 776, "scraper_regex": 821}}, "headline": "U.S. privacy board in disarray before Trump takes office", "wordcount_as_scraped": 821, "date": "20161222170000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON --\u00a0A federal board responsible for protecting Americans against abuses by spy agencies is in disarray just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.\n\nThe five-member Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board will have only two remaining members as of Jan. 7 \u2014 and zero Democrats, even though it is required to operate as an independent, bipartisan agency. The vacancies mean it will lack the minimum three members required to conduct business and can work only on ongoing projects. Trump would have to nominate new members who would have to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe board was revitalized after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures on the scope of U.S. spying in 2013. It notably concluded that the NSA\u2019s phone surveillance program was illegal.\n\nSince then, it has been crucial in ensuring members of Congress and the public have a window into the highly secretive and classified world of intelligence agencies. But it\u2019s unclear whether Trump will support robust intelligence oversight. During his campaign, Trump appeared to support strengthened intelligence overall and surveillance of mosques, but he\u2019s more recently expressed distrust of intelligence agencies. The Trump transition team didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJim Dempsey, a Democrat, will leave the board Jan. 3 because for months the Senate has not confirmed his re-nomination by President Barack Obama. And former U.S. Judge Patricia Wald, the only other Democrat, informed the White House this month that she intends to retire effective Jan. 7. The board also will lose its executive director, Sharon Bradford Franklin, who plans to step down before Trump\u2019s presidency, according to an individual with knowledge of the board\u2019s operations who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about the matter.\n\nAlready in limbo is a public oversight report on the use of a Reagan-era executive order that since 1981 has authorized sweeping powers by intelligence agencies like the NSA to spy even on innocent Americans abroad and never has been subject to meaningful oversight from Congress or courts. The senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein of California, has said her committee has not been able to sufficiently oversee programs operated under the order.\n\nThe privacy panel\u2019s report on the order is stalled and there\u2019s no work being done on it, according to the individual, who has knowledge about the project\u2019s status. Some individual agency reports related to the order were expected to be completed before the board loses its quorum, the person said.\n\nAnother review, of a 2014 presidential directive that details U.S. signals-intelligence activities for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes, is on track to be released before Jan. 20, the individual said. That review was requested by Obama.\n\nOne of the board\u2019s two remaining Republicans, Rachel Brand, whose term officially expires in January, could continue through March. If Trump were to move forward with any board nomination, she may continue through the end of the year. Should Brand leave, Republican Elisebeth Collins would become the last board member; her term ends in January 2020.\n\nThe oversight board was created by statute in 2007. Its members serve part-time and required to be able to maintain a top-secret clearance.\n\nWhile lacking enforcement ability to impose its recommendations on the intelligence community, the board does have the \u201cpower of persuasion and invoking public concern about issues,\u201d said former board chairman David Medine, a Democrat who resigned a year early, in July, to work for a development organization. That power is significantly diminished without the minimum three members necessary to report findings to the public.\n\nThe board\u2019s review of intelligence agencies\u2019 use of Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which the NSA used to conduct bulk collection of domestic telephone records, concluded their program was illegal and should be shut down. That finding split along party lines with the Democrats in the majority.\n\nThe review also drove passage of the USA Freedom Act, which went into effect in November 2015. It prevents the government\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records and requires a request to a phone company first to be vetted by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court rather than an internal agency administrator.\n\nCongress has at various points, including in the 2017 intelligence budget bill, put in provisions to limit the board\u2019s authorities or constrain its spending.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in an emailed statement that the panel\u2019s role as a government watchdog is \u201cabsolutely critical now.\u201d\n\nHe said Congress needs to ensure the board functions as intended by defending its authority and making sure its new members are committed to independent oversight.\n\nThe board contributes \u201cimportant information to the public discourse and debate,\u201d said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the ACLU. But if it can\u2019t do its job, maybe \u201cwe\u2019re in the same lack of oversight that led to the abuses of the past.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.18483412265778, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 776, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.0178532132200004, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 8, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.8659793814432994, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/berlin-christmas-market-truck-attack-polish-victim-lukasz-urban/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Polish truck driver fought Berlin Christmas market terrorist \u201cto the end,\u201d cousin says", "wordcount_as_scraped": 532, "date": "20161220200000", "story_content": "WARSAW, Poland - He was the first victim in the attack on a Berlin Christmas market - a 37-year-old Polish truck driver who was seemingly stabbed and shot to death in the cabin of his truck.\n\nOne of his colleagues said he was so dedicated to his work and his truck that he could be expected to defend the vehicle \u201cto the end.\u201d\n\nLukasz Urban, a 37-year-old from the western village of Roznowo, near the border with Germany, was found dead in the cabin of the truck that was hijacked and driven into the crowd Monday evening, killing at least another 11 people.

As if somebody inside was learning how to drive,\u201d Zurawski said in a separate interview broadcast on TVP Info, the state broadcaster\u2019s all-news network.\n\nThere was no more movement until 7:40 p.m., when the truck started and traveled some 10 kilometers (six miles), sometimes turning in tight spots or crossing the double line, and arrived at the Christmas market, Zurawski said.\n\nLukasz Wasik, the manager of the Polish trucking company whose truck was used in the attack, described Urban, as a \u201cgood, quiet and honest person\u201d devoted to his work, and the vehicle he drove.\n\n\u201cI believe he would not give up the vehicle and would defend it to the end if attacked,\u201d Wasik said in quotes carried by TVP, Poland\u2019s state broadcaster.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.1144900321960405, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 525, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 9, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.62851496269, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.19047619047619, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/oscar-asghar-farhadi-academy-awards-trump-immigration-ban/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 812, "scraper_regex": 879}}, "headline": "Oscar-nominated film's director can't attend amid Trump immigration ban, group's leader says", "wordcount_as_scraped": 879, "date": "20170128160000", "story_content": "Last Updated Jan 28, 2017 8:54 PM EST\n\nThe director of an Oscar-nominated film can\u2019t attend next month\u2019s Academy Awards after President Trump banned entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim majority nations for 90 days, according to the leader of an Iranian-American group in Washington.\n\nTrita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, said on Twitter early Saturday that Iranian director Asghar Farhadi \u201cwon\u2019t be let into\u201d the U.S. to attend the Feb. 26 ceremony.\n\nConfirmed: Iran's Asghar Farhadi won't be let into the US to attend Oscar's.

Late Friday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in an internal email that at least 187 Google employees were affected by the ban, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US,\u201d Pichai said, according to the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues.\u201d\n\nFarhadi\u2019s \u201cThe Salesman\u201d was nominated for best foreign film. His much-admired \u201cA Separation\u201d won the category in 2012. \u201cThe Salesman\u201d is a psychological thriller about a young couple in Tehran involved in a production of Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Salesman.\u201d They move into a new apartment, where a violent act connected to a former tenant changes their lives.\n\nBefore Mr. Trump enacted the ban late Friday, Iranian actress Taraneh Alidoosti, who stars in \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d said she would boycott the Academy Awards to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s visa ban for Iranians is racist,\u201d she posted on Twitter Thursday amid reports about the ban.\n\nThe order Friday immediately suspended a program that last year resettled in the U.S. roughly 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice. Mr. Trump indefinitely blocked those fleeing Syria, where a civil war has raged, and imposed a 90-day ban on entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim majority nations.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. \u201cWe only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said the halt in the refugee program was necessary to give agencies time to develop a stricter screening system. While the order did not spell out what additional steps he wants the departments of Homeland Security and State to take, the president directed officials to review the refugee application and approval process and find any more measures that could prevent those who pose a threat from using the refugee program.\n\nThe U.S. may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government will continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, \u201cprovided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CBN News, Mr. Trump said persecuted Christians would be given priority in applying for refugee status.\n\n\u201cWe are going to help them,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been horribly treated.\u201d\n\nThe order was signed on Mr. Trump\u2019s most robust day of national security and foreign policy at the start of his presidency. He met with British Prime Minister Theresa May and had a lengthy phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.\n\nAs a candidate, Mr. Trump called for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration to the U.S. He later shifted his focus to putting in place \u201cextreme vetting\u201d procedures to screen people coming to the U.S. from countries with terrorism ties.\n\nThe State Department said the three-month ban in the directive applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen - all Muslim-majority nations.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of the executive order.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security,\u201d Lena F.

It would\u2019ve required many U.S. troops; he lacked support from Congress and the right under international law; the U.S. already had costly deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan; Syria\u2019s opposition wasn\u2019t prepared to govern; and Russia and Iran were protecting Syria\u2019s government.\n\nMr. Obama said military options short of invasion were tempting because \u201cwe wanted to do something.\u201d But it was \u201cimpossible to do this on the cheap.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama said he asked himself if he could do something to save lives.\n\nBut he said his No. 1 priority was doing what was right for America.\n\nAleppo, once Syria\u2019s largest city but home to its rebel movement, has become a humanitarian crisis under Syrian government -- backed by Russia -- airstrikes. As CBS News\u2019 Debora Patta reported earlier this week, the United Nations described the situation in the city as a \u201ccomplete meltdown of humanity.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, diplomats sought to salvage the evacuation of eastern Aleppo after it stalled amid recriminations by both sides in Syria\u2019s civil war, raising fears the cease-fire could collapse with thousands still desperate to escape the rebel enclave.\n\nThe Aleppo evacuation was suspended after a report of shooting at a crossing point into the enclave. The Syrian government pulled out its buses that since Thursday had been ferrying out people from the ancient city that has suffered under intense bombardment, fierce battles and a prolonged siege.\n\n\u201cThe carnage in Syria remains a gaping hole in the global conscience,\u201d said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \u201cAleppo is now a synonym for hell.\u201d\n\nThe halt also appeared to be linked to a separate deal to remove thousands of people from the government-held Shiite villages of Foua and Kfarya that are under siege by the rebels. The Syrian government says those evacuations and the one in eastern Aleppo must be done simultaneously, but the rebels say there\u2019s no connection.\n\nThe foreign minister of Turkey, a main backer of the rebels, said he was talking to his counterpart in Iran, a top ally of the Syrian government, to try to resume the evacuation.\n\nA closed emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council was held on the crisis in Aleppo, discussing a French proposal to have independent monitors oversee the evacuation of civilians and fighters. The council meeting ended with diplomats saying they would convene again this weekend.\n\nThe cease-fire and evacuation marked the end of the rebels\u2019 most important stronghold in the five-year-old civil war. The suspension demonstrated the fragility of the cease-fire deal, in which civilians and fighters in the few remaining blocks of the rebel enclave were to be taken to opposition-held territory nearby.\n\nIn announcing the suspension, Syrian state TV said rebels were trying to smuggle out captives who had been seized in the enclave after ferocious battles with troops supporting President Bashar Assad.\n\nSeveral opposition activists said Syrian troops shot and killed four people in one bus, but the incident could not be independently confirmed.\n\nThe Lebanon-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV broadcast images of the government buses apparently returning evacuees to eastern Aleppo after the road was closed.\n\nAl-Manar TV, the media arm of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group that supports Assad, said Syrian government supporters had closed the road used by evacuees from Aleppo, demanding the wounded from Foua and Kfarya be allowed to leave.\n\nSyrian state media said rebels shelled a road that was supposed to be used by people leaving the villages. But the opposition\u2019s Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Hezbollah fighters backed by Assad ally Iran had cut the road to protest a lack of progress in the evacuations.\n\nBuses that arrived at a collection point in the Hama countryside to pick up evacuees from the villages waited for hours to no avail.\n\nLater, two rebel spokesmen privy to the talks said the fighters besieging the villages, including the al Qaeda linked Fatah al-Sham Front, had agreed to evacuate several hundred wounded from the villages.\n\nTurkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu Agency said Prime Minister Binali Yildirim had called Iranian Presidential Deputy Ishak Cihangiri and told him he was ready to cooperate with Tehran on the evacuation issue.\n\nReports differed on how many people remain in the Aleppo enclave, ranging from 15,000 to 40,000 civilians, along with an estimated 6,000 fighters.\n\nThere also were contradictory reports on the number of evacuees. Syrian state TV put it at more than 9,000; the Syrian state news agency said 8,079 opposition fighters and their families have left; and Russia, a key Assad ally, said over 9,500 people, including more than 4,500, were taken out.\n\nMore than 2,700 children have been evacuated in the past 24 hours, including the sick, wounded and those without their parents, UNICEF said. Hundreds of other vulnerable children, including orphans, remain trapped, it added.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely concerned about their fate. If these children are not evacuated urgently, they could die,\u201d UNICEF said in a statement.\n\nThere are still \u201chigh numbers of women and infants, children under 5, that need to get out,\u201d added Elizabeth Hoff, Syrian representative for the World Health Organization, speaking by phone from western Aleppo.\n\nDuring Thursday night\u2019s evacuation, Pawel Krzysiek of the International Committee of the Red Cross told The Associated Press he could sense \u201cfear, desperation (and) anxiety\u201d among those waiting to escape.\n\nThe civilians - including children and the elderly, the wounded and the sick - were out in the cold, \u201cburning the plastic, trying to get some sort of heat to warm themselves,\u201d said Krzysiek, who is still in Aleppo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the people leaving their house behind, their lives behind. It is very often they are facing impossible choices and this all occurs at the very individual level and it is difficult to compare with anything else,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is what the people are going through with their families, their relatives. This is really something very personal for them. I have seen sadness. I have seen really sadness in the people eyes. Heartbreaking sadness, broken lives, heartbreaking stories,\u201d Krzysiek added.\n\nBefore the operation was suspended Friday, four convoys of ambulances and buses left Aleppo, Syrian state TV said, noting that some evacuees used their own vehicles.\n\nAlso on Friday, Syrian state media reported that a 7-year-old girl wearing a belt of explosives walked into a police station in the capital of Damascus, and her bomb was triggered by remote control, killing her and wounding a policeman.\n\nIn Japan, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a new peace initiative, saying he and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan were working to set up talks between Damascus and the opposition. Putin said they would take place in Astana, the capital of the Central Asian country of Kazakhstan.\n\nBassma Kodmani of the High Negotiations Committee, Syria\u2019s main opposition group, told the AP that her group supports the call for resumed peace talks but it wants them to take place under U.N. auspices and that it doesn\u2019t believe Astana was \u201cthe appropriate place.\u201d\n\nSeveral rounds of U.N.-mediated indirect peace talks this year in Geneva were suspended with no progress.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 10, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.24166011810303, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1136, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 15, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.88208057531, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 47, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.13732394366197, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-valverde-once-killer-now-ceo-youthbuild-usa-works-to-turn-youths-around/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 683, "scraper_regex": 729}}, "headline": "Once an inmate, now a CEO: Ex-con works to turn youths around", "wordcount_as_scraped": 729, "date": "20161226190000", "story_content": "SOMERVILLE, Mass. \u2014 John Valverde isn\u2019t your typical CEO. He spent 16 years in prison for killing a man accused of raping his girlfriend.\n\nWhile in prison, Valverde did his best to redeem himself, earning two college degrees, teaching fellow inmates how to read and write, and working as an HIV/AIDS counselor.\n\nNext week, he\u2019ll take over as chief executive officer of YouthBuild USA Inc., an organization with a global network of programs aimed at helping young, low-income dropouts reclaim their lives and get skills to land jobs and become community leaders.\n\nValverde said he thinks it is important for him to be honest about his past with the young people he\u2019s trying to help. One in three has a criminal record.\n\n\u201cThey are just like me, and therefore their path could be like mine, and therefore they could achieve things that they never imagined,\u201d Valverde said in a recent interview at YouthBuild\u2019s Somerville, headquarters.\n\nValverde went from being a promising young college student to a convicted killer.\n\nIn 1991, at age 20, Valverde decided to confront a photographer his girlfriend said had raped her. He shot the man once in the head, at point-blank range, killing him. The photographer, Joel Schoenfeld, was on probation for two other sex offenses at the time.\n\nValverde was convicted of manslaughter and spent 16 years in prison before being released on parole.\n\n\u201cFrom the first moment, I knew that what I did was wrong, but it was a long journey for me to accept full responsibility without rationalization, justification or excuse or blame,\u201d he said.\n\nValverde said that although he believes \u201cit\u2019s never possible to make amends for taking a life,\u201d he decided to try to transform his own life.\n\nValverde earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in behavioral science from Mercy College and a master\u2019s degree in Urban Ministry from the New York Theological Seminary while he was in prison. After his release in 2008, he worked as a paralegal, and then decided to work for nonprofit organizations. For the past seven years, he has worked for The Osborne Association, a New York organization that provides treatment, education and vocational services programs to current and former inmates.\n\n\u201cI felt called to perhaps be a face for second chances and a voice for second chances,\u201d Valverde said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t too much of a leap for Valverde to make the move to YouthBuild, an organization devoted to helping people pull themselves out of poverty. Valverde beat out 124 other candidates for the job.\n\nThe first YouthBuild program was started in 1978 in the New York City neighborhood of East Harlem, where a group of teens helped rebuild an abandoned 10-unit tenement. Since then, it has grown to 250 community-controlled programs around the U.S. and more than 80 programs in 21 other countries.\n\nProgram participants work toward their high school diplomas or equivalency while learning job skills by building affordable housing in their neighborhoods, performing community service and participating in leadership training. YouthBuild serves mostly people between ages 16 and 24 who are out of work, out of school and live in low-income neighborhoods, a population estimated at about 3 million in the U.S.\n\nBrianna Bell, 18, currently enrolled in the Youth Action YouthBuild program in East Harlem, said she was initially shocked when she first heard Valverde\u2019s story during his recent visit there.\n\n\u201cBut when I met him and got to know him, then I thought, if he can turn his whole life around, why can\u2019t I? Why can\u2019t I do something with my life?\u201d said Bell, who dropped out of high school after moving from Georgia to New York in 2015.\n\nKarim Couser, 19, also enrolled in the program, said he was struck by Valverde\u2019s candor about his past.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t try to come here with a sales pitch or anything,\u201d Couser said. \u201cHe showed that no matter what you did before, you could always make a future.\u201d\n\nValverde, now 47, has a special fondness for the young people served by YouthBuild. But don\u2019t call them \u201cat-risk youth,\u201d a description Valverde sees as a negative stereotype. \u201cOpportunity youth\u201d is the more accurate term, Valverde said.\n\n\u201c\u2019Opportunity youth\u2019 is really flipping that to say, \u2018I am a person that\u2019s full of potential,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019I can do anything in the world.\u2019\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.4627659320831299, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 683, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.67834906594, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161226190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.07467057101025, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-cosbys-lawyers-attack-bandwagon-sexual-assault-accusers/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [923, 2357, 3484, 4747]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 730, "scraper_regex": 777}}, "headline": "Bill Cosby's lawyers attack \"bandwagon\" sexual assault accusers", "wordcount_as_scraped": 777, "date": "20161215020000", "story_content": "NORRISTOWN, Pa. -- Bill Cosby\u2019s lawyers on Wednesday attacked what they called \u201cvague, remote and often inconsistent\u201d allegations from a slew of women whom prosecutors are seeking to call as witnesses at his sexual assault trial next year. Lawyers for the 79-year-old actor and comedian asked a judge to block 13 accusers from taking the stand, saying uncertainty about where and when some of the sexual encounters took place made them impossible to defend against. Cosby, who was known as America\u2019s Dad for his top-rated family sitcom, \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d which ran from 1984 to 1992, is charged with molesting a woman at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. Prosecutors are seeking testimony from the other accusers to show that Cosby had a long history of knocking out women with drugs and drinks and sexually assaulting them. Cosby has pleaded not guilty.\u00a0\n\nAt a hearing outside Philadelphia, the defense portrayed the potential prosecution witnesses as \u201cbandwagon\u201d accusers who came forward because they sought to cash in on Cosby\u2019s fame and wealth. The women went public at the urging of \u201cclever, cunning lawyers who had the agenda of bringing down an American icon,\u201d Cosby lawyer Brian McMonagle told Montgomery County Judge Steven O\u2019Neill, who must determine whether some or all of the accusers will be permitted to take the witness stand. The two-day hearing closed without a decision, with O\u2019Neill saying he\u2019d take some time before ruling. McMonagle argued prosecutors dredged up unsubstantiated assault allegations dating to the 1960s to try to breathe life into a weak case, and urged O\u2019Neill to \u201cfollow the money\u201d when examining the motives of the accusers. \u201cThere\u2019s no good reason in this world for these uncorroborated, unconfirmed, unreported, ancient allegations to be brought into this courtroom or any courtroom in this country,\u201d he said afterward. Cosby is charged with assaulting Andrea Constand, then a Temple University employee. She filed a police complaint against Cosby, a long-married father of five and her friend and mentor, but a prosecutor at the time declined to file charges. Authorities reopened the investigation last year after scores of women raised similar accusations and after Cosby\u2019s damaging deposition testimony from Constand\u2019s lawsuit became public.\u00a0\n\nO\u2019Neill ruled last week that the deposition may be used at Cosby\u2019s criminal trial, arming prosecutors with Cosby\u2019s testimony about his affairs with young women, his use of quaaludes as a seduction tool and his version of the sexual encounter with Constand. Cosby\u2019s attorney said Wednesday that Constand has offered shifting accounts of the encounter, making comparisons with the other accusers impossible. Under state law, prosecutors must demonstrate substantial similarities in the accusers\u2019 accounts to be able to call them to the witness stand. Prosecutors have argued that sexual assault victims often recall more details in subsequent interviews, and they say the discrepancies in Constand\u2019s accounts are not material to the case. The other women should be allowed to testify, District Attorney Kevin Steele argued earlier Wednesday, because their stories are so similar they show the \u201chandiwork of the same perpetrator.\u201d Cosby befriended women who saw him as a mentor, incapacitated them out with pills and drinks and molested them, he said. \u201cThis is a lifetime of sexual assault on young women,\u201d Steele told O\u2019Neill.\u00a0\n\nCosby\u2019s lawyers said the women\u2019s stories aren\u2019t similar enough to warrant their testimony. They pointed to differences in the location and manner of the alleged assaults, as well as the accusers\u2019 level of education and line of work. \u201cYou cannot ignore the differences,\u201d said another defense lawyer, Angela Agrusa. She said most of the potential prosecution witnesses are represented by famed civil lawyer Gloria Allred and have held news conferences and given dozens of interviews. Agrusa said one accuser shopped a book deal for her life story a few years ago. Allred \u201cduped\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office, Agrusa argued. \u201cShe executed a plan, and she got the DA\u2019s office to be her bag man,\u201d Agrusa said. Allred, who attended Wednesday\u2019s hearing, has argued her clients have a duty to testify if the court wants to hear from them. \u201cWe say as lawyers that when you have the law on your side, you argue the law. If you don\u2019t have the law, you argue facts. If you don\u2019t have the facts, then you attack the victim or other lawyers, or both. Today there was a full-scale attack on victims,\u201d Allred said. The Associated Press doesn\u2019t typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they have come forward publicly, as Constand has done.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.45959568023682, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 730, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.62221910943, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.7397260273972597, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-donald-trumps-inaugural-address-might-tell-us-about-his-presidency/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1188, 1325, 1343, 1964, 2857, 4758, 5613]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1005, "scraper_regex": 1075}}, "headline": "What Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural address might tell us about his presidency", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1075, "date": "20170120040000", "story_content": "Friday, America will witness the Grand Opening of the Trump administration. Which Donald Trump will appear? Will it be the negotiator whose opening statement shocks and destabilizes? That\u2019s how he has kept people off guard in his career and his campaign. Or, will it be the Donald Trump who arrives at holidays and special occasions like election night-- the milder twin who will reach out to his opponents, acknowledge the fragile political moment and pace through a careful speech.\n\nRegardless of which Donald Trump appears, no permanent conclusions can be drawn from an inaugural speech. Actions are always more important than words, and Donald Trump has proved to be more changeable than any professional politician. But his speech will give us some hints about whether he accepts some constraints of the presidency, feels the weight of history and how he reads the political landscape.\n\nAn inaugural address is a compulsory exercise of the presidency. Donald Trump hasn\u2019t shown much interest in the compulsory. It is why he was successful in the campaign, and it\u2019s why some people are nervous about his new job.\u00a0\n\nMr. Trump did show some restraint during the campaign, however. By its end, his advisers had convinced him to use a teleprompter (even\u00a0after he had said\u00a0using one was a sign of weakness and unfitness for office), and they quarantined his Twitter account.\n\nIt was a highly limited restraint. Now he has won, and the binds of the election are gone. What will constrain him now? What will compel him to tone it down now that he has won? And how much will it compel him? The inaugural address offers a first hint.\n\nMr. Trump has been sent by his supporters to blow up Washington. Giving the kickoff speech to an explosion is familiar territory for the 45th president. It\u2019s his usual opening gambit, says Richard LeFrak, his friend of forty years, and fellow New York developer.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe may say something that sounds extreme to some people, but it\u2019s just his way of stimulating some conversation,\u201d the billionaire developer told me in an interview for CBS\u2019s prime time inauguration special. \u201cOr taking a negotiating position which he knows he\u2019s gonna walk back from, but he\u2019s gonna, you know, get the conversation started that way.\u201d\n\nIt would be Donald Trump\u2019s instinct to start with a bang, and it would be a glorious moment for his supporters if he presented himself as their tribune after Washington had ignored them for so long.\n\nHe could present himself as the warrior for his America whose actions are validated by his election victory. This was the tone of his last press conference. \u201cI won,\u201d he said, as if that were all that were necessary to explain why voters supported any view he held. That tone would clash against the moment, defining unity only on his terms\u00a0as Barack Obama\u2019s second inaugural address did.\n\nInaugurations are designed to pull the country together. They are an act of renewal where, in symbol and word, a president signs on to the continuing task of maintaining the principles, ideas and the notions of greatness that makes the rest of the country stand and salute.\n\nBefore Donald Trump even starts speaking, he will affirm a central American characteristic: the peaceful transfer of power. That\u2019s why presidents are pulled to unity by the moment. Even after the brutal election of 1801, Thomas Jefferson could declare \u201cWe are all Republicans. We are all Federalists,\u201d because as ragged as Americans were, they hadn\u2019t elevated a king or descended into bloodshed, like Europe. All Americans could join Jefferson in cheering that success.\n\nIt would be in keeping with his nature if Donald Trump broke the rules of renewal and unity. On the other hand, Trump does know how to sound the notes of unity. On Election Night he spoke beyond his coalition: \u201cFor those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I\u2019m reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so we can work together and unify our great country.\u201d\n\nSince then, Mr. Trump has done almost nothing to back up those words\u2014to reach out to those who are afraid of his presidency. He has held victory rallies in the states that voted for him, promoted jobs he saved and used his penchant for marketing and salesmanship to burnish his coalition, but spent none of his marketing energy on matching those words of unity.\n\nWill he do more Friday?\n\nThe test of Mr. Trump\u2019s speech is not whether he can assert that America should be unified, but whether he can make the people feel it who aren\u2019t already wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. That\u2019s the task of a president -- to do more than simply assert -- to lift those who aren\u2019t already with you.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI want to be a cheerleader,\u201d Mr. Trump told me a year ago about his vision of the presidency. How do you get people to cheer who aren\u2019t already on your team? An inauguration offers the best opportunity to access the national team spirit. Does he have the interest and inclination to make a broader pitch? Does he have a command of the vocabulary of common purpose, history, values and spirit? There will be a lot of irritations to make him think it\u2019s not worth it, from the protesters to the Democrats who have agreed not to attend his elevation ceremony.\n\nTrump\u2019s populist appeal has been compared to Andrew Jackson, whose inaugural speech highlighted a different test: could he read the political landscape? Jackson knew his opponents worried he would become a demagogue of the mob who would do as he pleased, so Jackson tried to set people at ease.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI shall keep steadily in view the limitations as well as the extent of the Executive power,\u201d he said, \u201ctrusting thereby to discharge the functions of my office without transcending its authority.\u201d\n\nJackson could read the national moment enough to know that he at least needed to speak to fears about his intentions. That\u2019s also a central task of the presidency. It not only puts you in a position to persuade those who aren\u2019t with you, but it keeps you from over-reaching. Of course, for Donald Trump over-reaching is what helped get him where he is.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.10599076747894, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1005, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.1474566929099996, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170120040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.59203980099502, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-food-running-out-syria-aleppo/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "U.N.: Food running out in Syria's east Aleppo", "wordcount_as_scraped": 767, "date": "20161110200000", "story_content": "Last Updated Nov 10, 2016 2:39 PM EST\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- A U.N. official says the last food rations inside besieged eastern Aleppo will run out by next week.\n\nSpeaking in Geneva, Jan Egeland, the special adviser to the U.N. envoy for Syria, said the last time the over a quarter of a million people inside east Aleppo received any humanitarian aid was at the beginning of July.\n\n\u201cThe reports we have now from within east Aleppo is that the last food rations are being distributed as we speak. There will not be more to distribute next week. Some families have not had any distributions, families in need of relief, have not had any distributions for several weeks already,\u201d Egeland said.\n\nIn Syria, a Kurdish-led force fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, north of the country is on the verge of surrounding a wide area north of the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, a spokeswoman for the group said.\n\nCihan Ehmed of the U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces told The Associated Press that its fighters are advancing on two fronts north of Raqqa, the de facto capital of ISIS\u2019 self-declared caliphate. The push from Ein Issa and Suluk north of Raqqa has been ongoing for days under the cover of airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition.\n\nThe SDF, which includes Kurdish, Arab, Syriac and Turkmen fighters, say they have committed 30,000 fighters to the offensive aiming to eventually recapture the city of Raqqa, which was announced on Sunday. Iraq is meanwhile waging a major offensive to drive ISIS from the northern city of Mosul.\n\nEhmed said once the forces coming from the two directions meet north of Raqqa, they will surround 212 square miles of territory controlled by the extremists.\n\n\u201cThe operations are ongoing according to the plan,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said many people are fleeing areas of fighting north of Raqqa. It added that SDF fighters have advanced north of Raqqa, capturing new areas and raising to 17 the number of villages and farms taken from ISIS since the offensive began.\n\nLater on Thursday, the SDF said on social media that its fighters have captured three farms, a village, and have approached the village of Hayes where intense clashes are ongoing.\n\nThe operation to recapture Raqqa has been dubbed \u201cEuphrates Rage\u201d and a joint operations command has been set up to coordinate various factions taking part in the battles.\n\nElsewhere in Syria, a rocket fired by rebels struck a school in the capital Damascus\u2019 central al-Mohajireen neighborhood wounding three children, state media said without providing further details.\n\nIn the rebel-held Damascus suburbs of Douma and Saqba, government airstrikes killed at least 11 civilians, including four children and three women, according to the Syrian Civil Defense in Damascus suburbs. The Observatory also said 11 were killed, but said they included four women.\n\nIn Aleppo, seven people were wounded, some critically, when rebels shelled two government-held neighborhoods, state news agency SANA said. Later on Thursday, pro-government media also said allied troops moved in on new rebel advances in the western part of the city, regaining control of parts of the strategic Al-Assad district amid intense clashes.\n\nThe rebels had seized a couple of strategic areas in western Aleppo since they launched an offensive on government-held parts of Aleppo on Oct. 28 in an attempt to break the siege imposed on areas they have controlled since July. The siege on eastern Aleppo was coupled with a punishing bombing campaign by Syrian aircraft and supported by Russia, which has been backing the government of President Bashar Assad. Since late October, Russia said it would halt the airstrikes, amid rising civilian casualties, urging rebels to leave the territory.\n\nA statement by the Russian Defense Ministry Thursday said such halts would continue. Russia had earlier bristled at extending the breaks in the fighting in Aleppo, saying it would play into the hands of the insurgents.\n\n\u201cThe humanitarian pauses are undoubtedly needed,\u201d said Spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov. \u201cBut we believe that simply extending their duration without offering real assistance to civilians, and allow the terrorists to restore their capabilities, would be unproductive and defy common sense.\u201d Russia and Syria\u2019s government refer to all armed opposition as \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nInsurgents have refused to leave, saying the halts are not supervised by the U.N. and lack safety guarantees for evacuation. The U.N. has failed to secure humanitarian aid to the besieged Aleppo districts during the halts.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because he was not authorized to release details to the press.\n\nTurkish authorities have not publicly released any information on the investigation or on a possible motive for the policeman.\n\nStill, Turkish police have detained seven people in connection with the gunman: his parents, sister, three other relatives and his roommate in Ankara, Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nAccording to the news agency, Altintas took leave from work and on Dec. 14 made a hotel reservation near the art exhibition center.

The House approved the resolution in a 227-198 vote.\n\nThe legislation doesn\u2019t need to be signed by the president and wouldn\u2019t actually change a word of the hotly contested health care law. But its passage is crucial if Republicans controlling Congress are to keep their longstanding promise to scuttle the law, which has delivered health coverage to about 20 million people but is saddled with problems such as rapidly rising premiums and large co-payments.\n\nThe timetable for the upcoming repeal measure is uncertain, but Republicans want to pass it as quickly as possible. The pending legislation would allow a follow-up bill to pass without having to clear the 60-vote filibuster hurdle in the Senate, where Republicans control 52 seats and Democrats are gearing up for an epic battle.\n\nAfter pressure from both President-elect Donald Trump and rank-and-file lawmakers, House GOP leaders are now promising to advance legislation to repeal the health law and replace it with something else in tandem.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to step in and provide relief from this failing law,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters on Thursday. \u201cAnd we have to do it all at the same time so that everybody sees what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nTrump is promising the public that he will sign legislation to repeal and replace the law soon. Republican leaders are trying to deliver, but it seems as if Trump may be overpromising, given the enormity of the task and the political stakes involved.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a creature of this place so there\u2019s always a bit of a learning curve,\u201d said the No. 3 Senate GOP leader, John Thune of South Dakota.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., isn\u2019t setting a timetable but said Thursday that the early repeal bill would \u201cbegin to make important progress\u201d and that Republicans \u201cplan to take on the replacement challenge in manageable pieces, with step-by-step reforms.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepealing and replacing Obamacare is a big challenge. It isn\u2019t going to be easy,\u201d McConnell added.\n\nMcConnell spoke after the Senate approved the preliminary repeal measure by a near party-line 51-48 vote, drawing a Twitter thumbs-up from Trump: \u201cCongrats to the Senate for taking the first step to #RepealObamacare - now it\u2019s onto the House!\u201d\n\nThe controversial law has provided health care subsidies and Medicaid coverage for millions who don\u2019t get insurance at work. It has required insurers to cover certain services like family planning and people who are already ill, and has curbed rates that the sick and elderly can be charged.\n\nGOP leaders hope to use their first bill to void and rewrite as much of Obama\u2019s law as they can, but so far they\u2019ve provided little detail.\n\nRepublicans want to end the fines that enforce the statute\u2019s requirements that many individuals buy coverage and that larger companies provide it to workers - mandates that experts say were needed to stabilize insurers\u2019 rates. They also want to erase the taxes the law imposed on higher-income people and the health care industry, eliminate its subsidies that help people buy policies and pare back its Medicaid expansion.\n\nBut they face internal disagreements over policy, such as how to pay for their new statute and how to protect consumers and insurers during what may be a two- or three-year phase-out of Obama\u2019s overhaul.\n\nThey also must heed Senate rules forbidding provisions that don\u2019t directly affect taxes and spending from being safeguarded from filibusters. That means repealing important parts of the law - like the requirement that insurers offer coverage to all customers including the most ill - would have to await later bills that would need Democratic support.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.16448330879211, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 627, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 16, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.67276264578, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.98724082934609, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/aleppo-syria-civilians-trapped-shrinking-bombed-opposition-territory/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2292, 2339]}}, "headline": "\"Terrifying\" scene as thousands penned in by Syrian army advance", "wordcount_as_scraped": 880, "date": "20161212150000", "story_content": "BEIRUT -- The Syrian military said on Monday it had gained control of 98 percent of Aleppo, including virtually all of the previously-rebel-held enclave of eastern Aleppo, reducing the rebel territory to a small sliver packed with civilians and fighters squeezed under fire.\n\nA Syrian rebel spokesman said opposition fighters are retreating in eastern Aleppo under intense government fire that is putting thousands of civilians at risk, calling the collapse \u201cterrifying.\u201d\n\nThe military statement came hours after Syrian forces, aided by Shiite militias from Lebanon, Iraq and Iran, took Sheik Saeed, one of the largest neighborhoods in the southern part of the rebel territory, tightening the noose on the enclave.\n\nThe military also said its multi-pronged ground push on Monday captured the al-Fardous neighborhood, one of the most populated districts to the north of Sheik Saeed. Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the district remains under fire and that fighting continues there. He estimated that about seven percent of the enclave remains under rebel control.\n\nActivists and the United Nations have estimated that as many as 100,000 people remain trapped in the rebel enclave.\n\n\u201cThe situation is very, very critical,\u201d said Ibrahim al-Haj, a member of the Syrian Civil Defense. \u201cThe military took many areas and we are now squeezed.\u201d Al-Haj had been on the move to find a place to keep him and his family away from the clashes and possible government capture.\n\nBassam Haj Mustafa, a senior member of the rebel Nour el-Din el-Zinki group who is in contact with fighters inside the city, said Monday the fighters are doing \u201ctheir best to defend what is left.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe collapse is terrifying,\u201d he said in a message to reporters.\n\nTens of thousands of civilians have fled to government-held western Aleppo since the offensive began last month. But tens of thousands remain trapped in the ever-shrinking eastern enclave.\n\n\u201cRegime forces are advancing into Sheikh Saeed, al-Firdaws and Bostan al-Qasr .. they\u2019ve encircled these districts completely,\u201d opposition activist Monther Ataki, who was among those trapped in the shrinking rebel-held territory Monday, told CBS News . \u00a0\u201cWe need international protection right now\u201d. \u00a0\n\nA rebel fighter from inside Aleppo, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said the fall of Sheik Saeed means the fall of the enclave\u2019s only mill and grains warehouse, which leaves the territory without access to bread or flour.\n\nMost of the remaining civilians have now gathered in two or three neighborhoods, packing thousands in a small space and threatening large casualty tolls in any new attack, he said.\n\nIn a map distributed by the military\u2019s media arm, a small sliver of land, a long rectangular shape in the city center abutting the western, government-held parts of the city, remained in rebel hands. It includes six neighborhoods, most of them still areas where fighting is still underway.\n\nA Turkey-based Syrian organization that supported a number of medical facilities and agricultural projects in Aleppo said it was terminating all its activities in the besieged enclave because all of its eight ambulances have been destroyed. The Shafak organization said 47 of its 57 staff are stuck in areas still under rebel control and that it has lost communication with most of them.\n\nThe group ran a U.N.-funded primary health care facility in al-Fardous before it was captured by the government, along with Shafak\u2019s warehouses elsewhere in eastern Aleppo that stored fuel and medical supplies.\n\nSyrian troops backed by Russian airstrikes and militias from across the region launched a wide-scale offensive on eastern Aleppo last month and are on the verge of driving the rebels from the city. Doing so would hand President Bashar Assad his greatest victory yet in the Syrian civil war, now in its sixth year.\n\nThe offensive to retake rebel-held eastern Aleppo, which began on Nov. 26, followed an intensive aerial bombing campaign that knocked out most of the eastern sector\u2019s medical facilities, targeted civil defense and municipal vehicles and blocked roads with rubble. The eastern Aleppo rebel enclave was cut off from outside aid since July by a government siege.\n\nEarlier on Monday morning, state TV aired footage from Sheik Saeed, one of eastern Aleppo\u2019s largest neighborhoods bordering some of the most crowded districts. A residential area, Sheik Saeed also has open agricultural fields that often gave an advantage to rebels fighting off past government advances.\n\nThe Observatory said government forces continued their bombing of the remaining rebel areas on Monday, including airstrikes on Bustan al-Qasr, near the government-controlled western part of Aleppo, and al-Fardous. The military later announced it seized al-Fardous.\n\nState TV has lately been broadcasting every day images of hundreds of civilians fleeing areas where troops are advancing, pouring into western Aleppo. Those areas are only accessible through government-monitored crossing points.\n\nA total rebel defeat in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city and once its commercial center, would reverberate across the war-torn country, where opposition forces continue to hold out in smaller, scattered areas.\n\nIt would cap a string of government successes over the past year and provide a turning point in a war that has killed more than a quarter of a million people, displaced more than half of the country\u2019s population and defied all international efforts for a political solution.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 14, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.98476600646973, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 845, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.75690016435, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 43, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161212150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.0887573964497, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-to-start-rolling-out-executive-actions-immigration-wednesday/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [383, 882, 1251, 1561, 2246, 2583, 5131]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 706, "scraper_regex": 800}}, "headline": "AP: Trump to start rolling out executive actions on immigration Wednesday", "wordcount_as_scraped": 800, "date": "20170125030000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump will begin rolling out executive actions on immigration Wednesday, beginning with steps to tighten border security -- including his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border -- and other domestic immigration enforcement measures, according to two administration officials.\u00a0\n\nLater in the week, the president is expected to restrict the flow of refugees to the United States. The proposed plans include at least a four-month halt on all refugee admissions, as well as temporary ban on people coming from some Muslim majority countries, according to a representative of a public policy organization that monitors refugee issues. The person was briefed on the details of that proposed action by a government official and outlined the expected steps for The Associated Press.\u00a0\n\nThe officials and the public policy organization\u2019s representative insisted on anonymity in order to outline the plans ahead of Trump\u2019s official announcements. The president is expected to sign the first actions Wednesday during a trip to the Department of Homeland Security, with additional actions being rolled out over the next few days, according to one official.\u00a0\n\n\u201cBig day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday night. \u201cAmong many other things, we will build the wall!\u201d\n\nThe tweet followed one that appeared to be deleted.

Among many other things, we will build the wall!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017\n\nIt appeared as though the refugee restrictions were still to be finalized. The person briefed on the proposals said they included a ban on entry to the U.S. for at least 30 days from countries including Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, though the person cautioned the details could still change. There is also likely to be an exception in the refugee stoppage for those fleeing religious persecution if their religion is a minority in their country. That exception could cover Christians fleeing Muslim-majority nations.\u00a0\n\nTrump campaigned on pledges to tighten U.S. immigration policies, including beefing up border security and stemming the flow of refugees. He also called for halting entry to the U.S. from Muslim countries, but later shifted the policy to a focus on what he called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d for those coming from countries with terrorism ties.\u00a0\n\nAs president, Trump can use an executive order to halt refugee processing. President George W. Bush used that same power in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Refugee security vetting was reviewed and the process was restarted several months later. While the specific of Trump\u2019s orders were unclear, both administration officials said Wednesday\u2019s actions would focus in part on the president\u2019s plans to construct a wall along the southern border with Mexico. Trump\u2019s insistence that Mexico would pay for the wall was among his most popular proposals on the campaign trail, sparking enthusiastic cheers at his raucous rallies. Mexico has repeatedly said it will not pay for any border wall. Earlier this month, Trump said the building project would initially be paid for with a congressionally approved spending bill and Mexico will eventually reimburse the U.S., though he has not specified how he would guarantee payments. Trump will meet with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the White House next week. In claiming authority to build a wall, Trump may rely on a 2006 law that authorized several hundred miles of fencing along the 2,000-mile frontier. That bill led to the construction of about 700 miles of various kinds of fencing designed to block both vehicles and pedestrians. The Secure Fence Act was signed by then-President George W. Bush and the majority of the fencing in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California was built before he left office. The last remnants were completed after President Barack Obama took office in 2009. The Trump administration also must adhere to a decades-old border treaty with Mexico that limits where and how structures can be built along the border. The 1970 treaty requires that structures cannot disrupt the flow of the rivers, which define the U.S.-Mexican border along Texas and 24 miles in Arizona, according to The International Boundary and Water Commission, a joint U.S.-Mexican agency that administers the treaty. Other executive actions expected Wednesday include bolstering border patrol agents and ending what Republicans have argued is a catch-and-release system at the border. Currently, some immigrants caught crossing the border illegally are given notices to report back to immigration officials at a later date. If Trump\u2019s actions would result in those caught being immediately jailed, the administration would have to grapple with how to pay for jail space to detain everyone and what to do with children caught crossing the border with their parents.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.96825385093689, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 706, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.76638619176, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 8, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170125030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5410764872521203, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kate-del-castillo-el-chapo-interview-with-sean-penn-cost-her-jobs/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 652, "scraper_regex": 694}}, "headline": "Kate del Castillo, favorite \u201cEl Chapo\u201d actress, says interview with Sean Penn cost her jobs", "wordcount_as_scraped": 694, "date": "20170117190000", "story_content": "MIAMI - Mexican actress Kate del Castillo said Monday that her involvement in actor Sean Penn\u2019s interview with drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman has cost her acting jobs and a \u201cmacho\u201d Mexican government is persecuting her only because she\u2019s a woman.\n\nDel Castillo told the Associated Press in an interview had to shoot her upcoming Netflix series \u201cIngobernable\u201d - or \u201cUngovernable\u201d - in the United States because she fears she\u2019ll be detained if she returns to Mexico. The actress still faces government accusations of obstruction of justice and money laundering related to the 2015 meeting with the Sinaloa cartel leader, who was on the run after his second escape from a Mexican prison.\n\n(After the Associated Press published their interview with Castillo, a spokeswoman for Mexico\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office said there are no warrants for Del Castillo\u2019s arrest, but she has been \u201cmentioned\u201d in criminal investigations. The spokeswoman added that Del Castillo \u201chas no legal impediment to enter or move freely\u201d in Mexico.)\n\nDel Castillo said she\u2019s grateful to Netflix for standing by her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been a good year,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t work because people didn\u2019t want me, because they were afraid.\u201d\n\nDel Castillo will release a campaign Tuesday with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, calling on Miami Seaquarium to release its orca named Lolita into a coastal sanctuary. In videos produced by PETA in English and Spanish, del Castillo urges people to boycott marine parks.\n\nShe starred in a similar campaign for PETALatino last year criticizing SeaWorld\u2019s treatment of its orcas. In Mexico, the actress also lobbied with PETA to ban bullfighting and circus animals.\n\nIn an interview at a Miami hotel, del Castillo said she hoped Seaquarium and SeaWorld parks would soon follow the iconic Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus in closing for good. Feld Entertainment will close its circus permanently in May because of falling ticket sales, high operating costs and changing public tastes in entertainment amid prolonged battles with animal rights groups.\n\nDel Castillo said her activism has made her somewhat regret acting in the 1996 Mexican telenovela \u201cAzul,\u201d which also starred Keiko, the orca made famous in the film \u201cFree Willy.\u201d The orca was released into the wild in 1998 and died in 2003.\n\n\u201cI could have done more,\u201d del Castillo said.\n\nNow living in Los Angeles, de Castillo said she won\u2019t let her exile from Mexico dampen her activism, though she does worry about her parents\u2019 security in Mexico. Del Castillo laughed at the irony of starring in \u201cIngobernable\u201d as the first lady of Mexico (\u201cThe timing is no bueno for me,\u201d she said), and she cautioned her fans and critics to remember the political series is fictional.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Probably it was a little too risky. You can like it or not, but it\u2019s nothing illegal,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy am I the only one who is being persecuted? Because I\u2019m a woman. If I was a man, this would never have happened. I get it, especially in Mexico - we\u2019re very macho.\u201d\n\nGuzman was recaptured in January 2016 and is fighting extradition to the U.S., where he faces drug trafficking and other charges. Del Castillo said she still plans to make a movie about him once her legal dispute with Mexico\u2019s government has ended.\n\nAt roughly 52 years old, Lolita is the oldest orca living in captivity, and the only one in the U.S. to live outside a SeaWorld park. PETA and other animal rights groups have for years sought to have Lolita released into a protected marine pen in Puget Sound waters, where the female orca was legally captured in 1970.\n\nThe Jan. 6 death of Tilikum, the SeaWorld orca that killed a trainer in 2010 and was later profiled in a documentary that helped sway popular opinion against keeping killer whales in captivity, makes Lolita\u2019s plight more poignant, said Jared Goodman, PETA\u2019s director of animal law.\n\n\u201cShe can have a happier ending than Tilikum did, dying alone in his tank,\u201d Goodman said.\n\nMessages left Monday for Seaquarium officials were not immediately returned.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.70270276069641, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 652, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 7, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.3460887091900005, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.9877300613496898, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lithuanian-elves-fight-russian-propaganda-online/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2173]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 647, "scraper_regex": 686}}, "headline": "Small army of \"elves\" fighting Russian propaganda online", "wordcount_as_scraped": 686, "date": "20161228220000", "story_content": "VILNIUS, Lithuania \u2014 Elves against trolls: it sounds like something out of \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d But to Ricardas Savukynas, the battle he\u2019s fighting is no fantasy.\n\nThe 43-year-old business consultant and blogger is part of an informal internet army of Lithuanians trying to counter what they describe as hate speech and pro-Russia propaganda.\n\n\u201cI am just a regular guy from Lithuania, a citizen, who once noticed that Russian propaganda is being spread in this country by huge numbers of groups on Facebook,\u201d he told The Associated Press over tea at a restaurant in Vilnius\u2019 old town. \u201cSeeing this I thought that it cannot be a natural thing.\u201d\n\nSavukynas\u2019 fellow volunteers -- who\u2019ve dubbed themselves \u201celves\u201d -- patrol social media, coordinating their actions through Facebook or Skype to expose fake accounts.

But in a telephone interview, Maliukevicius said that Lithuania needs a complex counterstrategy to beat what he describes as Kremlin propaganda.\n\n\u201cElves are just one bit of this,\u201d he said.\n\nTalk of Russian interference is bubbling on both sides of the Atlantic in the wake of the recent U.S. election, which propelled Russia-friendly candidate Donald Trump to power amid allegations of Kremlin interference. Earlier this month, Germany\u2019s intelligence agency accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the country with propaganda and cyberattacks before its general election planned for next year.\n\nLithuania, which like other Baltic nations was long subject to Moscow\u2019s rule, feels those concerns more keenly than most - all the more so after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine\u00a0in 2014.\n\nAnd the elf versus troll war on Facebook is just one battlefield. News websites and broadcasters have also been drawn into the mix.\n\n\u201cWe recognized, especially recently, that we have a pretty huge and long lasting disinformation campaign against our society,\u201d said Tomas Ceponis, an analyst for the Lithuanian military. He said the power of propaganda was harder to quantify than tanks or planes, but it was clearly aimed at \u201creally a very huge variety of targets.\u201d\n\nDelfi, one of the main news sites in Lithuania, was one of them. It found its comment sections filling up with pro-Russia posts in the lead up to the Ukrainian confrontation, said Monika Garbaciauskaite, the editor-in-chief, and now has full-time staff deleting the most extreme messages.\n\nThe hostile propaganda has led to more aggressive action from both sides.\n\nLithuania\u2019s leading commercial news channel TV3 has been repeatedly targeted by hackers who compromised the group\u2019s networks three times, according to Sigitas Babilius, TV3\u2019s head of news. Last month, Lithuania banned Russia\u2019s RTR Planeta channel until February after a Russian politician made anti-U.S. comments deemed as \u201cincitement to war, discord and hatred.\u201d Similar three-month bans on Russian state-owned channels have been ordered in previous years.\n\nLithuania, meanwhile, has launched a campaign on television urging citizens to report any suspicious activity -- on the street or on the web.\n\nThe moves rankle Moscow\u2019s representative to the tiny NATO nation.\n\n\u201cI do not think that sticking a propaganda label on another\u2019s point of view is right,\u201d Russian Ambassador Alexander Udaltsov told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s always better to use counterarguments to prove your truth, but unfortunately our Western partners lack these arguments and continue with bans of Russian TV stations.\u201d\n\nLithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius makes no apology for the bans.\n\n\u201cA lie is not an alternative point of view,\u201d Linkevicius said. \u201cOne can say \u2018it\u2019s freedom of speech, everyone can say whatever he wants.\u2019 Of course, I agree. But if it\u2019s (a) resourced propaganda machine brainwashing people, it\u2019s not just an alternative point of view.

And to Vetrano\u2019s family, the case for the search is clear.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOur only goal in life is to find out who did this to our daughter,\u201d said her mother, Cathy Vetrano. \u201cSo if there\u2019s any method available to do that, we want it done.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBut critics view the technique as a DNA dragnet that can single out otherwise law-abiding people for scrutiny because of family ties.\u00a0\n\n\u201cA policy that implicates New Yorkers in a criminal investigation solely because they are related to someone with DNA in the state\u2019s databank is a miscarriage of justice,\u201d said Donna Lieberman, the New York Civil Liberties Union\u2019s executive director.\u00a0\n\nTen states, including California, Texas and Florida, conduct familial DNA testing. Ohio on Monday announced its first effort yielded an arrest in the kidnapping and rape of a 6-year-old girl and the attempted abduction of a 10-year-old girl.\u00a0\n\nBut at least two jurisdictions, Maryland and the District of Columbia, have prohibited the practice.\u00a0\n\nAuthorities have long worked to identify suspects by matching crime scene evidence to convicted offenders\u2019 DNA. Familial DNA testing goes further, seeking people similar enough to be closely related to whoever left the crime scene DNA.\u00a0\n\nInvestigators can then explore whether such people have family members who fits as suspects. If so, they need other evidence, possibly a match to a suspect\u2019s own DNA, to bring charges.\u00a0\n\nFamilial DNA famously led to an arrest in Los Angeles\u2019\u201cGrim Sleeper\u201d serial killings, which spanned from 1985 to 2007. Lonnie Franklin Jr. was convicted and sentenced to death this year.\n\nAfter Vetrano\u2019s beaten body was found Aug. 2 in a marshy park in her quiet Queens neighborhood, investigators developed a DNA profile of the probable attacker from material under Vetrano\u2019s fingernails and on her neck and phone, but it didn\u2019t match anyone in law enforcement DNA databases. Meanwhile, police chased down 85 tips, interviewed runners, looked for clues in Vetrano\u2019s personal life and examined surveillance video and even panhandling reports from areas nearby.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis tragic murder has been exhaustively investigated using every tool currently available,\u201d Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said Thursday in asking the state Commission on Forensic Science to authorize familial searching.\u00a0\n\nCommissioners intend to discuss the topic at a meeting Friday. It\u2019s not clear when or what they\u2019ll decide, but spokeswoman Janine Kava said Thursday they\u2019ll continue working to provide law enforcement with \u201ccutting-edge tools\u201d to solve crimes \u201cwithout compromising individual protections.\u201d Concerns about familial DNA searching hit home for New Orleans filmmaker Michael Usry in 2014, when police showed up with a warrant to get his DNA as a possible suspect in a 1996 killing in Idaho.\u00a0\n\nA crime scene DNA sample was similar to that of Usry\u2019s father, who\u2019d voluntarily given it for a nonprofit genealogy project; police had gotten the data from a website that acquired it. The baffled filmmaker spent a month worrying about what would happen before further testing cleared him.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was a very weird situation,\u201d he said earlier this year.\u00a0\n\nCases like his trouble the technique\u2019s critics. \u201cWe don\u2019t subject some people to disparate treatment because of taint of blood,\u201d says Erin Murphy, a New York University law professor who has studied the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s a violation of some of our foundational principles.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSupporters say familial DNA investigations can be structured to pursue only strong leads and do it discreetly. California, for instance, strives to investigate them without letting on to the potential suspects or their family members.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe idea that we\u2019re rousting relatives, innocent people, it\u2019s a fabrication,\u201d says Rockne Harmon, a retired California prosecutor and prominent voice for familial DNA searching.\u00a0\n\nCathy Vetrano has her own assessment. \u201cIf any person who thinks it\u2019s unfair was in this situation,\u201d she says, \u201cI think they would be feeling differently.\u201d\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.01023006439209, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 719, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.55453638177, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209210000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.00695410292072, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/n-c-gop-strips-some-of-democratic-governors-power/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [346, 500, 959, 1725, 3548, 5000, 5096, 5373]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 724, "scraper_regex": 919}}, "headline": "N.C.

Just last week,\u00a0it appeared Republicans were ready to finally accept Democrats\u2019 narrow win in a contentious governor\u2019s race. As it turns out, they weren\u2019t done fighting.\u00a0\n\nIn a surprise special session in the dying days of the old administration, some say the Republican-dominated legislature has thrown the government into total disarray, approving at least one bill aimed at emasculating incoming Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s administration. Cooper, the current attorney general, has threatened to sue. And many in the state are accusing Republicans of letting sour grapes over losing the governor\u2019s mansion turn into a legislative coup.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis was a pure power grab,\u201d said retired school librarian Carolyn White, 62, a long-time demonstrator who was arrested as part of the \u201cMoral Monday\u201d protests against GOP-led legislative policies. \u201cI got arrested two years ago. Did it make any difference? No. But just like the civil rights movement, it\u2019s forward together. You just have to keep going forward.\u201d\n\nThe protesters were so loud that Senate and House cleared the galleries - a highly unusual move - and more than two dozen people were arrested this week. Some protesters chanted \u201call political power comes from the people\u201d as demonstrators were escorted from the Legislative Building by authorities. Those that remained behind could only watch the debate through glass windows or listen to it online.\u00a0\n\nHundreds stomped their feet or banged on windows outside the gallery, causing several Republican lawmakers to note they were having trouble hearing during the debate. Democrats repeatedly stated their objections. \u201cThe kindergartners are getting rowdy,\u201d said Republican Rep. Dana Bumgardner. She said Democrats were \u201ccreating out of thin air a talking point for the next election.\u201d\n\nRepublican Gov. Pat McCrory, who lost to Cooper by about 10,000 votes, quickly signed into law a bill that merges the State Board of Elections and State Ethics Commission into one board comprised equally of Democrats and Republicans, according to documents from General Assembly staff. The previous state elections board law would have allowed Cooper to put a majority of Democrats on the panel. The law would also make elections for appellate court judgeships officially partisan again. Another bill that received final legislative approval would force Cooper\u2019s Cabinet choices to be subject to Senate confirmation.\n\nMcCrory must decide whether to sign the second law passed by a General Assembly that has repeatedly tugged the man who campaigned as a moderate in 2012 as Charlotte\u2019s moderate former mayor into hard-right turf. Lawmakers\u2019 veto-proof majorities since 2013 and the uncompetitive election districts they drew have allowed legislative Republicans to ignore Democratic viewpoints and sometimes McCrory\u2019s desires. Republicans insist the legislation is simply adjusting the constitutional powers already granted to the General Assembly. Many of the provisions had been debated for years but always got set aside. \u201cThere\u2019s probably no better time than to deal with it in the present,\u201d said Republican Rep. Bert Jones.\n\nDemocrats said it was an attempt by the GOP to cling to power a week after the Republican incumbent conceded.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI really fear that we have harmed our reputation and integrity this week,\u201d said Rep. Billy Richardson, a Democrat. Republicans gained power of both legislative chambers in 2010 for the first time in more than a century, and they have veto-proof majorities, holding 108 of 170 seats even though the state has been more closely divided in recent statewide and federal elections. North Carolina is a presidential battleground state that Barack Obama won in 2008 by just over 14,000 votes. Four years later, Mitt Romney edged Obama by about 92,000 votes. Donald Trump won in November. GOP legislators have been able to expand their majorities thanks to approving redistricting maps in 2011. But nearly 30 of those legislative districts were struck down last summer. A federal court has directed updated maps be approved by March 15. Cooper ran on a platform of defeating Republicans\u2019 agenda, saying he would work to repeal a law known as House Bill 2 that limits LGBT rights. \u201cIf I believe that laws passed by the legislature hurt working families and are unconstitutional, they will see me in court,\u201d Cooper said. Republicans pointed to past sessions of the General Assembly, when it was dominated by Democrats. Democrats stripped the powers of the first and only GOP lieutenant governor of the 20th Century in the late 1980s. But Democrats said there\u2019s been no such widespread effort to limit the power of an incoming executive before he took office.\u00a0\n\nOn Friday afternoon, N.C. GOP Chairman Robin Hayes issued a statement about those protesting \u00a0the dicusssions this week.\n\n\u201cYesterday the rights of over nine million citizens were violated when a small mob formed inside the North Carolina House and Senate Chambers in an attempt to stop the duly elected representatives from debating critical issues,\u201d the statement said,\u00a0CBS Raleigh affiliate WNCN reported.\n\n\u201cWe support the freedom and right of every citizen to speak for or against legislation, and well as the constitutional right to petition government for a redress of grievances. However, when a few hundred people decide to shut down the work of the General Assembly simply because they are against the outcome, we have gone from free speech to mob rule,\u201d it said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.8809831142425497, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 724, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.23421922317, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.90055248618785, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-nears-the-end-how-did-we-get-here/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2583, 4214, 4368, 5484, 5643, 5702, 6854, 7613, 7807, 7927, 7929, 7931, 7932]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1215, "scraper_regex": 1342}}, "headline": "Election 2016 nears the end: How did we get here?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1342, "date": "20161106160000", "story_content": "The time has come this campaign season to take a look at THE BIG PICTURE.

There\u2019s a kind of pitchfork-mob anger going on out there.\u201d\n\nLike the battle of the titans, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have gone at each other across an ideological chasm.\n\nTrump: \u201cI want to build a wall.

In a campaign about negatives, Clinton v. Trump comes down to trust v temperament.\n\n\u201cNobody really knows what all these emails add up to in the end,\u201d said Brinkley, \u201cexcept whenever it\u2019s raised, Hillary Clinton gets deeply defensive, and it gave a taint on her that she is a candidate that is running with the FBI in pursuit of her.\u201d\u00a0 \n\nBrinkley added, \u201cPeople hate Donald Trump because he\u2019s prejudiced. He says bigoted remarks, he often speaks from a bully pulpit of ignorance, [and] he degrades women.\u201d\n\nHow many times have you heard, \u201cThere\u2019s never been a campaign like this one\u201d? \n\nJoseph Cummins, who has written \u201cAnything for a Vote\u201d (Quirk Books), a history of dirty tricks and cheap shots in U.S. elections, says 2016 is somewhat unique: \u201cYou have an unprecedented situation where you have one candidate, Donald Trump, claiming that the other candidate should be in jail, that\u2019s actually one part of this current election that we haven\u2019t seen before.\n\n\u201cA dirty election runs in our blood; this is part of being American. I like to say about this election that it\u2019s really a 19th century election that\u2019s occurring in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nConsider the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson ran against John Adams: \u201cJefferson hired a scurrilous Scottish writer named James Callender to accuse John Adams of being a \u2018hideous hermaphrodite which has neither the force nor the firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensitivity of a woman.\u2019 John Adams and his people for their part were already spreading rumors that Thomas Jefferson was sleeping with slaves in Monticello (which in fact he was). They also used one of my favorite all-time slurs in American election campaigns by simply saying, \u2018Well, you can\u2019t vote for Thomas Jefferson because he\u2019s dead. And how can you vote for a dead man?\u2019\u201d\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s claim that the election is rigged, before it actually happens? \u201cThat\u2019s something that we haven\u2019t seen before in American elections,\u201d Cummins said.\u00a0\n\nClinton: \u201cThere was even a time when he didn\u2019t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged.\u201d\u00a0Trump: \u201cI should have gotten it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only truly stolen, rigged election in American history was 1876, which is the dirty election of all time, where you had Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican, running against Samuel Tilden, the Democrat.\u201d\n\nTilden was ahead. This was the post-Civil War Reconstruction period, when the Republicans controlled the South. \n\nSo what did they do?\n\n\u201cThey basically telegraphed the people who counted the electoral votes in Florida, in Louisiana and South Carolina, and they said, \u2018Change those votes, make those Republican votes and not Democratic votes,\u2019\u201d said Cummins. \n\n\u201cSo someone messed with the votes?\u201d\n\n\u201cLiterally, yes. This was the one election in American history that it can be proven it was stolen.\u201d\n\nAnd so Republican Rutherford B. Hayes became our 19th president.\n\nBut Cummins said, \u201cWhen you talk to pollsters, people claim, \u2018Oh, I hate dirty elections, it\u2019s terrible.\u2019 Well, as a matter of fact, they do like dirty elections, and they pay attention to dirty elections.\u201d\n\nProof: The first Clinton-Trump debate was the most-watched in TV history, with 84 million viewers.\u00a0\n\nClinton: \u201cDonald supported the invasion of Iraq.\u201d Trump: \u201cWrong.\u201d Clinton: \u201cThat is absolutely ...\u201dTrump: \u201cWrong.\u201dClinton: \u201c... proved over and over again.\u201d\u00a0Trump: \u201cWrong.\u201d\n\nBut Trump never misses a chance to launch\u00a0a full-throated attack on the media. NBC correspondent Katy Tur has been a frequent punching bag, even requiring Secret Service protection.\n\nHas Trump actually been treated unfairly? \u201cThe most distinctive thing about Trump\u2019s coverage is how much there is of it,\u201d said George Mason University professor Robert Lichter. His studies of media bias are often cited by conservatives. \u201cTrump is outrageous; he\u2019s unpredictable, all the definitions of what makes someone newsworthy.\u201d\n\nAnalysis of nearly 20,000 articles on the websites of major media outlets show stories about Trump vastly outnumbering stories about Clinton.

They were to receive an update from Army Gen. Joseph Votel on the battles to retake Mosul, ISIS\u2019 key stronghold in Iraq, and Raqqa, the self-declared ISIS capital in Syria. As head of U.S. Central Command, Votel is the top officer overseeing the counter-ISIS campaign in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe defense officials also were to discuss doing more to train and equip the kinds of local Iraq and Syrian forces, including police and tribal fighters, that will be needed to hold Mosul and Raqqa once, as expected, ISIS is uprooted from those cities. ISIS has held those centers for more than two years.\n\nIn his introductory remarks, Carter said the coalition must remain involved in Iraq even after ISIS is driven from Mosul.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to continue to counter not only foreign fighters trying to escape, but also ISIL\u2019s attempts to relocate or reinvent itself,\u201d he said, according to his prepared remarks. \u201cTo do so, both the United States and the coalition must remain engaged militarily. In Iraq in particular, we must be prepared to provide sustained assistance to the Iraqi security forces to consolidate security over the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has about 5,000 troops in Iraq.\n\nBut the backdrop to Thursday\u2019s conference is deep uncertainty in London, Berlin and other coalition capitals about the implications for the counter-ISIS efforts of a change in U.S. administrations in January. Mr. Trump has criticized President Obama\u2019s approach to fighting the militant group as weak and ineffective, and he has suggested that the U.S. has blindly supported anti-ISIS groups without knowing their true aims.\n\nAmong the questions Carter cannot answer: Will Mr. Trump withdraw support for U.S.-backed rebels groups in Syria, who have now lost the city of Aleppo? And if he does, will he join forces with Russia? How might such moves affect public support for the anti-ISIS coalition in Germany and elsewhere?\n\nThough Mr. Obama has tried to work diplomatically with Russia, Syria cease-fire deals have repeatedly collapsed, with the U.S. accusing Moscow of failing to use its influence to prevent Syria\u2019s President Bashar Assad from violating them. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s military intervention has succeeded in helping Assad reclaim the upper hand. The U.S.-led coalition has avoided direct military action against Assad\u2019s force, focusing instead on supporting local rebels willing to fight ISIS while coupling that effort with aerial bombing in both Syria and Iraq.\n\nCarter was expected to emphasize to his counterparts at the London conference the prominent role that retired Marine Gen. James Mattis will play as the president-elect\u2019s choice to succeed Carter at the Pentagon. Mattis is well-known and widely admired in Europe, having headed NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Command Transformation from 2007 to 2009, a role focused on preparing the military alliance for security challenges of the future.\n\nCarter has held five other counter-ISIS conferences with coalition partners. Thursday\u2019s will be the first to include Iraq\u2019s army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Othman al-Ghanami. The other countries represented, in addition to the U.S., are Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Norway, Spain and Turkey.\n\nIn addition to hearing from Votel about the military campaigns in Iraq and Syria, the officials will receive a briefing by Marine Lt. Gen. Joseph Osterman on U.S. efforts to disrupt ISIS\u2019 plans for directing, supporting and inspiring attacks outside of Iraq and Syria. Osterman is deputy commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.\n\nAt nearly every stop on his current round-the-world tour, Carter has met with U.S. troops and assured them that the counter-ISIS campaigns are going according to plan. At Aviano air base in Italy on Wednesday, Carter said coalition-backed Arab and Kurdish fighters are within 15 miles of Raqqa, the self-declared ISIS capital in Syria, and that they are \u201ccompleting the envelopment and ultimately the seizure\u201d of the city.\n\nHe also alluded to the uncertain future of the campaign and the coalition.\n\n\u201cWe need to look ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat comes after? And are we getting ready for that?\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.586166501045227, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 751, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.92608671626, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.3288948069241, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/peter-pan-peanut-butter-tainted-with-salmonella-case-11-million-penalty/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 707, "scraper_regex": 756}}, "headline": "Tainted peanut butter case ends in $11.2 million penalty", "wordcount_as_scraped": 756, "date": "20161214170000", "story_content": "A decade after hundreds of Americans got sick from eating Peter Pan peanut butter contaminated with salmonella, the company that sold it paid with an embarrassing courtroom guilty plea and an agreement to pay the largest criminal fine ever in a U.S. food safety case.\n\nThe president of a ConAgra subsidiary entered a guilty plea on behalf of his company Tuesday to a single misdemeanor count of shipping adulterated food. A U.S. District Court judge then approved a deal ConAgra reached with prosecutors to pay an $8 million fine plus $3.2 million in cash forfeitures.\n\n\u201cObviously they\u2019re able to absorb an $11 million penalty much more than a smaller company,\u201d said Bill Marler, a Seattle-based attorney who specializes in food safety cases. \u201cBut it still sends a pretty significant message.\u201d\n\nThe plea deal resolved a long criminal investigation into a nationwide salmonella outbreak blamed on tainted peanut butter that sickened at least 625 people in 47 states.\n\nDisease detectives traced the salmonella to a plant in rural Sylvester, Georgia, that produced peanut butter for ConAgra under the Peter Pan label and the Great Value brand sold at Walmart. In 2007, the company recalled all the peanut butter it had sold since 2004. By then, most of it had been eaten.\n\nLeo Knowles, president of ConAgra Grocery Products, offered no testimony as he entered the misdemeanor plea on behalf of the Chicago-based corporation\u2019s subsidiary.\n\n\u201cIt made a lot of people sick,\u201d prosecutor Graham Thorpe said as he described ConAgra\u2019s decision to continue shipments from the Georgia plant in late 2006 despite lab tests that had twice detected salmonella.\n\n\u201cThe industry has taken notice of this prosecution,\u201d Thorpe said.\n\nThe fine represents just one tenth of one percent of ConAgra\u2019s current $8 billion market capitalization. The company also will pay $3.2 million in cash forfeitures to the federal government.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge W. Louis Sands waited more than 18 months after ConAgra agreed to the plea deal so that victims could be contacted before he approved the settlement.\n\nThe case began in 2006, as doctors around the country reported severe gastrointestinal illnesses caused by salmonella. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health officials traced the common factor \u2014 peanut butter \u2014 outbreak to the plant in rural Georgia.\n\nIn February 2007, ConAgra recalled its previous three years of peanut butter production, and Peter Pan vanished from store shelves for about six months. Despite the widespread illnesses, no deaths were ever confirmed to be caused by the salmonella outbreak.\n\n\u201cThe company has behaved in a model way, as a model corporate citizen, ever since that time,\u201d Douglas Fellman, an attorney for ConAgra, told the judge. \u201cSince that time, we have an unblemished record. Peter Pan peanut butter is wholesome and it\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\nConAgra said it didn\u2019t know peanut butter was contaminated with salmonella before it was shipped. However, the plea agreement documents noted that ConAgra knew peanut butter made in Georgia had twice tested positive for salmonella in 2004.\n\nConAgra officials blamed moisture from a leaky roof and a malfunctioning sprinkler system for helping salmonella bacteria grow on raw peanuts. The company spent $275 million on upgrades and adopted new testing procedures to screen for contaminants.\n\nThe $3.2 million in forfeitures relates to the tainted products, which by federal law must be surrendered to the government. Since ConAgra dispensed with the recalled peanut butter nearly a decade ago, prosecutors asked for cash instead.\n\nNone of the criminal penalties goes to victims. The judge said more than 150 people had filed paperwork seeking financial restitution, but none could prove they were sickened by salmonella caused by eating the recalled peanut butter.\n\nThree women made their case to the judge, testifying they suffered severe gastrointestinal illness after eating from jars of Peter Pan in late 2006, and suffered from lingering health problems a decade later. The judge said he was sympathetic, but awarded them no money.\n\n\u201cThis to me is an injustice done all over again, especially after 10 years of waiting for justice,\u201d said Mona McCombs of Bloomington, Indiana.\n\nMcCombs testified that she and several relatives, including her elderly mother, became extremely sick after eating Peter Pan just before Christmas in 2006. She blames ConAgra for her mother\u2019s death three months later, but none of them were tested while sick by a doctor for salmonella to prove it.\n\nThe judge noted that others had already received cash from ConAgra in civil settlements, which he said totaled $36 million to 6,810 people.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.66280555725098, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 707, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.2269526089599996, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 12, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214170000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.1018387553041, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-us-drone-controversy-russia-election-hacking-ian-bremmer-eurasia-group/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2260, 2789, 3334, 3933, 3938, 5034, 5049]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 798, "scraper_regex": 888}}, "headline": "Was China's seizure of U.S. drone a message to President-elect Trump?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 888, "date": "20161219200000", "story_content": "As China prepares to return the U.S. underwater drone it seized last Thursday in the South China Sea, one global political risk expert asserts the timing of the incident sends a direct message to President-elect Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that Chinese could have been doing this six months ago, 12 months ago \u2013 they\u2019re not. The fact that they are doing it now shows that they clearly don\u2019t like the statements that have been made by President-elect Trump on a host of issues with China,\u201d Eurasia Group founder Ian Bremmer said Monday on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d \n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Trump irked China when he spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai Ying-wen, breaking precedent and becoming the first American president-elect to speak with a Taiwanese president since the U.S. cut formal diplomatic ties with the island in 1979.\n\nAfter China and the U.S. agreed the drone would be returned, Mr. Trump tweeted: \u201cChina steals United States Navy research drone in international waters \u2013 rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act.\u201d\n\nLater he wrote: \u201cWe should tell China that we don\u2019t want the drone they stole back. - let them keep it!\u201d\n\nWe should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 18, 2016\n\nChinese state media said the country was returning the drone because it posed no safety threat, adding that the U.S. inappropriately hyped the incident.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like the word steal. That\u2019s totally inaccurate,\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. \n\n\u201cUnlike a lot of other countries, if the Americans really decide they are going to escalate versus China, the Chinese have the capability to give it right back,\u201d Bremmer said. \u201cTrump really believes that America has a much stronger negotiating position internationally, and the Chinese are going to show him that the reality is very unlike that.\u201d\n\nBremmer said there is no question that the Chinese have been conducting more \u201cmilitary exercises and live fire\u201d in the South China Sea, where the contested waters and islands have become a sensitive issue between the U.S., China and other countries in the region. \u00a0\n\n\u201cThey overflew with a nuclear capable bomber and now they\u2019ve allowed their sailors in the region to be more aggressive in responding to a drone being available,\u201d Bremmer said. \n\nIn addition to China-U.S. relations, Bremmer also discussed Russia hacking the U.S. during the 2016 campaign. CIA director John Brennan sent a memo to intelligence staff on Friday saying the director of national intelligence and the FBI director now agree with the CIA that Russian hacking was, in part, intended to help Mr. Trump win the election.\u00a0\n\nPresident Obama vowed the U.S. will respond \u201cat a time and a place of our own choosing.\u201d But there\u2019s \u201cvery little\u201d the U.S. can do to Russia, Bremmer said.\n\n\u201cWe have only a few weeks before Obama is gone, and it seems pretty clear from everything that Trump has said about Russia that his inclination is not only to disbelieve the intelligence but cozy up with this country as closely as possible. So the time of Obama\u2019s choosing is clearly running out,\u201d Bremmer said. \n\nNow a group of both Republican and Democratic senators is calling for a\u00a0special committee to investigate the evidence into the hacking.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve ordered this comprehensive intelligence review which they will make known at least to the Democrats and Republicans in Congress, certainly a lot of that is going to get leaked,\u201d Bremmer said. \u201cThe hope is that that constrains Trump from being able to cozy up with the Russians, who will be seen to have compromised American national security. But keep in mind, this went on under Obama. The response from the United States was not very strong. And part of the reason it\u2019s hard for the Democrats to hit Trump on\u00a0this\u00a0is because consistently Russia is the biggest failed policy under Obama in terms of Syria, in terms of Ukraine and now in terms of the hacks as well.\u201d\n\nThe hacking began in 2015, reports CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan, and the stolen Democratic Party emails began appearing on WikiLeaks ahead of Hillary Clinton\u2019s nominating convention this summer.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s thinking that they certainly have delegitimized the American election. They\u2019ve put a lot of questions in people\u2019s mind as to whether or not this was an effective democratic process or not,\u201d Bremmer said. \u201cWe are seen as hypocrites, and the United States has tried to show the Russians as hypocrites historically. They say they have their own democratic process and of course we know that\u2019s not really true. They pretend to have rule of law that doesn\u2019t really work. So, you know, they\u2019re giving it back to us right now.\u201d \n\nAnd the Russian\u2019s meddling isn\u2019t over, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Germans and the French have elections coming up and we know that the Russians intend to influence the outcome of those elections,\u201d Bremmer said. \u201cNow\u00a0by the way, in\u00a0this case, influence them in ways that Mr. Trump would support, in favor of the far right Euro-skeptic parties in ways that Obama would dislike.

The former NSA and CIA director was among 50 national security officials who signed a letter in September warning that Donald Trump was a \u201crisk\u201d to the country\u2019s national security.\n\nNow that the once-unlikely billionaire is our newest president-elect, the risk has become even realer to Hayden.\n\n\u201cLook, I think it\u2019s fair to say that he\u2019s become the president-elect by showing anger, by being accusatory, frankly, not being all that fact-based and scapegoating real and imagined enemies,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cNone of that fits into the intelligence picture \u2013 that\u2019s very alien to the way intelligence comes at an issue. And unless he has a conversation with what I call the fact-based, inductive, world-as-it-is people and they have a meaningful dialogue, I fear he\u2019s going to continue to act on this other set of beliefs and that\u2019s going to be very bad for America and for the world.\u201d\n\nIn a past appearance on \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d Hayden highlighted some of the biggest national security threats expected to confront the next president, including what he called \u201cambitious, fragile and nuclear\u201d states like Iran.\n\nThe Iran deal signed by the Obama administration may be in jeopardy under a Trump presidency, as the president-elect has run expressed opposition to the pact throughout his campaign (along with some misstatements\u00a0about it).\n\nBut Hayden said he didn\u2019t think it was possible for the deal to be dismantled because it is \u201crelatively locked in.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe immediate impact of the deal with regard to the nuclear deal program is OK,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the other things that the Iranians are doing and frankly, Mr. Trump had good criticisms of the administration. Don\u2019t let them get away with what they\u2019re doing in Syria, in Yemen and elsewhere.\u201d \n\nHayden said those issues were a greater priority, and that the new administration could worry about Iran\u2019s nuclear program years later when the current provisions of the deal \u201cbegin to age off.\u201d \n\nAnother top concern for Hayden in the next presidency is threats from Russia, especially because of Trump\u2019s past comments\u00a0 expressing admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Congratulating Trump on his stunning upset Wednesday, Putin expressed hope in working with the president-elect. \n\nAlluding to Trump\u2019s past comment about wanting a good relationship with Russia, Hayden said he, too, would like that, but it \u201ccan\u2019t be cost-free for the Kremlin.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\u201cI would also like him to make some conditions on the Russian, that the Russians have to do certain things and stop doing other things for us to begin to have a more mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cI have yet to see word one in terms of what Russian behavior has to look like before we enter into this more meaningful dialogue.\u201d\n\nAs for the fight against ISIS, Hayden said the United States is in a \u201cpretty good spot,\u201d though he has expressed some concerns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been way too light, overregulated and underresourced but right now we are on the cusp of a significant victory in Mosul. It\u2019s going to take time and frankly, we\u2019re beginning to tighten the vise around Raqqa as well,\u201d Hayden said. \n\nDespite the progress, Hayden still has a fear about Trump\u2019s approach to ISIS. \n\n\u201cMr. Trump thinks we are where we are now because we\u2019ve been weak and stupid. I think we\u2019ve been slow, but not weak and stupid,\u201d Hayden said. And he seems to have the belief that we can kill our way out of this quickly and then go home.

It was his fifth event Sunday. \n\nThousands of supporters packed the barn and it didn\u2019t seem like anyone was frustrated by Trump\u2019s tardiness, or as he called it, \u201ca midnight special.\u201d It was the busiest day in Trump\u2019s quixotic year and a half run for the presidency, two days before Election Day. Trump started his run on June 16, 2015.\n\n\u201cFamous day, right?\u201d Trump said at his first rally of the day in Sioux City, Iowa. The stops Trump made; Sioux City, Iowa, an airport hangar in Minneapolis, Minnesota, an amphitheater in suburban Detroit, another airport hangar outside Pittsburgh, and the barn in Northern Virginia, indicated a candidate desperately trying to cobble together a narrow path to 270 electoral votes, as early voting shows other paths out of reach. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing,\u201d Trump said in Minneapolis. \u201cIf I don\u2019t win Minnesota, I\u2019m gonna look real bad to those pundits that I do not respect very much.\u201d The last time Minnesota\u2019s electoral votes went to a Republican presidential candidate was Richard Nixon in 1972. Recent polling shows Hillary Clinton with a comfortable lead in the state. However,\u00a0 Trump needs an upset from a traditionally Democratic states to have any hope of winning the White House -- especially as early voting in battleground states such as Nevada show a significant increase in Hispanic turnout, a demographic which has long viewed Trump unfavorably.Trump is the underdog in most of the other states he campaigned in on Sunday. Polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia have also given Clinton a comfortable lead, although Democrats have shown enough concern that Trump is closing the gap to send a bevy of surrogates there, including sending the former Secretary of State herself to speak in Detroit on Friday. The Republican nominee\u2019s messaging was knocked off kilter on Sunday when news of FBI director James Comey\u2019s letter to Congress broke, stating that new emails discovered on disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop, related to Clinton\u2019s private email server from her time as Secretary of State, did not contain anything that would change the FBI\u2019s conclusion from the summer -- that this did not rise to the level of criminal prosecution. After days of praising Comey and the FBI for re-opening the investigation into Clinton, Trump tweaked his message to subtly criticize Comey, saying, \u201cThe investigations into her crimes will go on for a long, long time.\u00a0 The rank and file special agents at the FBI won\u2019t let her get away with her terrible crimes.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t review 650,000 new emails in eight days,\u201d He continued.\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t do it, folks.\u201d Trump\u2019s ability to stay on message was sorely tested, as he frequently deviated off his prepared remarks, extending his speeches and dragging his schedule later and later into in the night. In particular, Trump seemed fixated on Beyonce and Jay-Z, who recently performed on behalf of Clinton at a campaign event in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cJay-Z and Beyonce used the most filthy language you\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Trump said in Minneapolis, referring to their performances on behalf of Clinton. \u201cMany of the audience left during the audience because it was disgusting, the words, right? They left.\u201d Ironically, Trump\u2019s warm up at his next event in the Detroit suburb of Sterling Heights was musician Ted Nugent,\u00a0 who has long faced criticism for racist and anti-Semitic comments. Nugent, whose hits include \u201cCat Scratch Fever,\u201d lived up to his raunchy reputation on Sunday. During his remarks, Nugent grabbed his private parts and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got your blue state right here, baby!\u201d Trump came on stage after and said, \u201cBy the way, my language is much, much cleaner as you know than Jay-Z and Beyonce, boy.\u201d Trump circled back again to discussing his ambitions to engage in a fist fight with Vice President Joe Biden, a subject he has kept circling back to for weeks. \u201cBiden, who said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019d like to take him behind the gym.\u2019 Me. I dream about that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd everybody said, \u2018Oh, wasn\u2019t that nice? Oh, did you see what he said? Wasn\u2019t that cute? Oh, it was so wonderful what Joe said. What Joe said. Wasn\u2019t that cute?\u2019 Now, if I ever said that I wanna take him behind the gym and you know what. They\u2019d say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a bully. He\u2019s a terrible person.\u2019\u201d His darkest rhetoric of the whirlwind day was aimed at the large Somali community in Minnesota, numbering in the tens of thousands. \u201cHow stupid are they to allow this to happen?\u201d Trump said. \u201dHere in Minnesota, you\u2019ve seen first-hand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, without\u00a0 your support or approval, and with some of them then joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world.\u201d Trump continued. \u201cA Trump Administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community where they are being placed.\u201d The crowd at the airport hangar in Minneapolis erupted in cheers. \u201cIt\u2019s the least they can do for you. You\u2019ve suffered enough in Minnesota.\u201d Trump\u2019s last day of campaigning before Election Day is equally as hectic, with stops in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan on the schedule. Confidence in his ability \u201cto win,\u201d of course, has never been lacking in the businessman. \u201cWe have the biggest crowds and it\u2019s the greatest movement ever in the history of our country, Trump said in Michigan. \u201cWe now have to go out and we have to vote.\u201d In Virginia, he added , \u201dThis is going to be Brexit times fifty.

In other words, the agency is scrutinizing its soon-to-be boss.\u00a0\n\nHow independent will that examination be?\n\nGiven the long history of White House meddling with the IRS, both proven and alleged, this is no idle question. By custom, the IRS is supposed to be fenced off from politics. Some government ethics experts and watchdog organizations say the Trump White House needs to explicitly pledge to keep its hands off the audit.\n\nThe examination of Trump\u2019s taxes must be conducted by staffers who are under Civil Service protection, meaning they can\u2019t be fired at will, said Robert W. Painter, the White House ethics attorney under President George W. Bush.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe audit must be a credible process,\u201d said Painter, now a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, in an interview. \n\nThere is no law preventing a president or his aides from seeking to influence the IRS, according to Painter. While regulations are in place forbidding federal officials from seeking to influence U.S. agencies on personal matters, he said, they could couch their efforts as a matter of government interest. \u201cThey\u2019d have to be very blatant\u201d to cross the line, Painter noted.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s why a \u201cblanket assurance\u201d from the new administration about the Trump audit is needed, said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\u00a0\n\nThe IRS did not respond to a question about safeguarding the audit\u2019s independence. The agency is part of the Treasury Department, likely soon to be led by a Trump loyalist. The presidential transition team has recommended Steven Mnuchin, the Trump campaign\u2019s national finance chairman and an alumnus of investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS), to the president-elect for Treasury secretary, sources told CBS News.\n\nA request for comment on the audit issue to the Trump transition team went unanswered. To be sure, no evidence exists that Trump has any intention of bending the IRS to his advantage. And during the campaign, he regularly inveighed against federal abuse of power and insider backscratching.\u00a0\n\nStill, Trump has said he will \u201cfight like hell\u201d to pay as little as possible in taxes. His attitude toward the current audit is typically antagonistic. On the campaign trail, he regularly complained that the IRS had been auditing him for more than a decade. \u201cEvery year, they audit me, audit me, audit me,\u201d he said during a primary debate in February.\u00a0\n\nA New York City case from 30 years ago, involving a hotel called the Grand Hyatt that Trump opened, shows just how hard he can fight an audit. City auditors encountered numerous obstacles from Trump -- missing books, stonewalling and clever accounting practices, according to auditors -- that let him make much lower payments than the city expected. (He was ultimately obliged to pay the city a form of rent, in exchange for property tax breaks designed to spur economic development.)\n\nThe incoming president\u2019s federal taxes have been an ongoing issue this election year. The current IRS\u00a0audit of Trump\u2019s returns, from 2009 on, was the reason he gave for not releasing his tax filings during the campaign. Presidential candidates have disclosed them for the past four decades.\n\nAlthough numerous tax experts said no law requires a taxpayer being audited to keep returns under wraps, Trump repeatedly insisted he couldn\u2019t release his until the IRS finished the examination. His decision to withhold his tax documents from the public sparked speculation that they might disprove his claims of vast wealth and huge charitable gifts, or show he paid little or no taxes.\u00a0\n\nThe New York Times unearthed records in October revealing that in 1995 he reported a $916 million tax loss, which could wipe out any tax liability for years following.\n\nBending the IRS to an administration\u2019s political will has been a theme for so long that worries about the agency\u2019s independence today could be warranted. The most recent instance of it was the Republican allegation that the IRS was singling out conservative political groups for scrutiny. When these organizations applied for tax-exempt status, the agency subjected them to intense inspections.\n\nThe controversy resulted in the departure of the acting IRS commissioner and two top officials. Although the Justice Department said it would file no criminal charges, congressional Republicans were not convinced and contended that higher-level Obama administration figures must be involved.\n\nThe most blatant political interference with the IRS that came to light was that of Richard Nixon. As part of the bill of impeachment against him in 1974, he was accused of pressuring the IRS commissioner to audit people on his enemies list. Charges of employing the IRS as a political weapon have been lodged against numerous presidents, although proof about any such shenanigans isn\u2019t conclusive.\u00a0\n\nBut the contentions are believable and thus worrisome.

Her foreign minister went so far as to call Mr. Trump a \u201cpreacher of hate.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama arrived Wednesday night in Berlin from Greece, making his sixth and final visit as president to Germany, where he has been popular since even before he was elected. His eight years in office have helped erase much of the anti-American sentiment that had grown during the administration of George W. Bush over the Iraq war and other policies.\n\nMerkel, who worked well with Bush before Mr. Obama\u2019s election, dined with the president Wednesday night at his hotel and was to hold talks with him Thursday afternoon. The downtown area around the Chancellery and hotel where Mr. Obama was staying was locked down tightly, with some 2,400 police officers on hand manning road blocks and checkpoints.\n\nIn a joint opinion piece published Thursday in Germany\u2019s weekly business magazine Wirtschaftwoche, which seemed directed as much at the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. as European nations, the two leaders stressed that the \u201cunderlying bedrock of our shared values is strong\u201d even if the pursuit of common goals is sometimes gone about differently.\n\nMr. Obama and Merkel noted that European Union-U.S. trade was the largest between any two partners worldwide, and emphasized that the trans-Atlantic friendship has helped forge a climate accord, provide help for refugees worldwide, form a collective defense under NATO, and strengthen the global fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n\n\u201cThat friendship is based on our shared commitment to personal freedom and dignity, which only a vibrant democracy under the rule of law can guarantee,\u201d the leaders wrote.\n\nMerkel and Mr. Obama have enjoyed a close relationship over the years, and Mr. Obama seems to be counting on the German leader\u2019s strength to help counter the isolationist tone voiced by president-elect Donald Trump during the election campaign. Although the relationship hit a bump in 2013 when it was revealed the U.S. National Security Agency had been monitoring the chancellor\u2019s cell phone, tensions were smoothed over after President Obama acknowledged Germany\u2019s anger and promised new guidelines for monitoring.\n\nWhen Mr. Obama first visited the German capital in 2008, some 200,000 exuberant fans packed the road between the landmark Brandenburg Gate and Victory Column to hear the then-candidate, in a speech that solidified his place on the world stage.\n\nIn a city where President John F. Kennedy in 1963 pledged steadfast American support for Germany against the Soviet bloc with his iconic \u201cIch bin ein Berliner\u201d speech and President Ronald Reagan in 1987 challenged then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to \u201ctear down this wall,\u201d Mr. Obama told Berliners that true progress requires sacrifice and shared burdens among allies.\n\n\u201cThat is why America cannot turn inward,\u201d he told the cheering crowd. \u201cThat is why Europe cannot turn inward.\u201d\n\nEight years later, his words seem to have foreshadowed the nationalist, isolationist forces gaining traction in some parts of Europe and punctuated by Trump\u2019s victory in the U.S. election.\n\nIn Germany, officials have been outspokenly hopeful that the change in presidents will not signal a significant shift in relations between the two nations or the NATO alliance.\n\n\u201cThe Americans are among ...\u00a0 our most important partners and we want to continue this partnership economically, politically and through shared values,\u201d Peter Tauber, the general secretary of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Party, told reporters in Berlin, ahead of Mr. Obama\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cI think one will see that Mr. Trump will have his own political suggestions, but that the USA won\u2019t be a different country tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhite House aides had hoped Mr. Obama might be able to return to the Brandenburg Gate, where he spoke in 2013, for a symbolic visit on his last trip to Germany, but the visit didn\u2019t materialize. Overall, the celebratory nature of the U.S. president\u2019s final world tour has been significantly tamped down in light of the U.S. election results.\n\nIn Berlin, Mr. Obama will also meet Friday with the leaders of France, Italy, Spain and Britain. He\u2019s expected to address Mr. Trump\u2019s election and the direction the U.S. might take in the next four years.\n\nMerkel already talked with Mr. Trump by phone after his election, offering him Germany\u2019s \u201cclose cooperation,\u201d but emphasized it would be on the basis of what she said were shared values of \u201cdemocracy, freedom, respect for the law and for the dignity of human beings, independently of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the U.S. election, Mr. Obama and Merkel are expected to discuss a wide range of issues behind closed doors, including joint efforts to resolve the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, the fight against ISIS and trans-Atlantic trade.\n\nMr. Obama traveled to Berlin from Greece, which has been at the center of Europe\u2019s debt crisis, and the president was also expected to encourage some sort of debt forgiveness for the country -- something the International Monetary Fund has lobbied for but Germany and several other nations oppose.\n\nThe refugee issue is also at the top of the agenda on Mr. Obama\u2019s trip. Greece was the entry point to Europe for hundreds of thousands of migrants last year. Germany has taken in the vast majority with some 1.1 million arrivals since the start of 2015.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.294985264539719, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 903, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.95637366309, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161117140000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.3222591362126295, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-agent-george-piro-fort-lauderdale-airport-shooting-esteban-santiago-saddam-hussein/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3127]}}, "headline": "FBI agent who interrogated Saddam Hussein leads Ft. Lauderdale airport case", "wordcount_as_scraped": 754, "date": "20170109160000", "story_content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - The FBI agent who interrogated Saddam Hussein alone for months after the former Iraqi leader\u2019s capture is now leading the investigation into the Florida airport shooting rampage that killed five and is being blamed on an Iraq war veteran.\n\nGeorge Piro, special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Miami field office, was Saddam\u2019s sole interrogator beginning in January 2004. In previous interviews, Piro has said Saddam did not know his true identity - the Iraqi leader called him \u201cMr. George\u201d - and that he posed as a high-level envoy who answered directly to then-President George W. Bush.\n\nNow the 49-year-old Piro, a native of Beirut, Lebanon, fluent in Arabic and Assyrian, is in charge of the FBI investigation into the shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport that left five people dead and six wounded. Federal prosecutors have charged Esteban Santiago, 26, with airport violence and firearms offenses that could bring the death penalty if he is convicted.\n\nIn announcing the charges filed Saturday, Piro said his thoughts are with the victims and their families.\n\n\u201cI want to ensure these families that law enforcement is working tirelessly in order to ensure justice is served,\u201d he said.\n\nPiro, an FBI agent since 1999, moved with his family from Lebanon to California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley as a teenager. After high school he enlisted in the Air Force, then became a police officer for a decade in Ceres, California, followed by a job as an investigator in the local prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nOnce he joined the FBI in Phoenix, Piro was one of only a handful of Arabic-speaking agents - a group that suddenly was in great demand after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks and the subsequent U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2003, Piro was promoted to the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division at headquarters in Washington, leading to his work as Saddam\u2019s interrogator.\n\nIn later interviews, including a 2008 appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d, Piro said he met daily with Saddam in a windowless room and worked to gain his trust by becoming his only provider of necessities and such things as paper for Saddam to write poetry.\n\nEventually, Piro said Saddam confirmed that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction prior to the U.S. invasion but might seek them in future to deter Iran and other threats. Saddam also denied any links to al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, Piro has said.\n\nSaddam also liked to brag about how he escaped U.S. airstrikes and capture, according to Piro.\n\n\u201cWhat he wanted to really illustrate is ... how he was able to outsmart us,\u201d Piro told \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u2018\u2019He got rid of his normal vehicles. He got rid of the protective detail that he traveled with, really just to change his signature.\u201d\n\nPiro told Scott Pelley during his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that he was glad the dictator never found out he was just an FBI agent.\n\n\u201cI think initially he would have been angry. He would feel that I was way beneath him, and would not respond well to the interrogation. Or even to me,\u201d Piro said. \u00a0\n\nSaddam was later tried and executed by hanging in December 2006.\n\nSantiago, the airport shooting suspect, also served in Iraq in 2010 with the Puerto Rico National Guard as part of an engineering battalion, guard officials said. Santiago later served in the Army Reserves and Alaska National Guard.\n\nAfter Iraq, Piro moved on to top FBI counterterrorism jobs in Washington, including a White House position involving high-value detainee interrogation that works with various intelligence agencies.\n\nSince taking the top Miami FBI job, Piro has overseen work in more domestic areas such as health care fraud, identity theft and tax fraud, Ponzi schemes and mortgage fraud - all areas where South Florida is among the nation\u2019s leaders. Bank robberies, violent street gangs, public corruption and smuggling of humans and drugs round out much of the work for the Miami office\u2019s roughly 1,000 agents and employees.\n\nSince Friday\u2019s shooting, Piro has been careful to say no evidence linking Santiago to terrorism has been found but such connections have also not been ruled out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too early in the investigation. We\u2019re looking over all of his social media, things like that. It\u2019s giving us a picture of the individual, but it\u2019s way too early for us to rule out anything,\u201d Piro said Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re pursuing all angles on what prompted him to carry out this horrific attack.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.18556690216064, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 723, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.922540498430001, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170109160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.11756569847856, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/wilmer-valderrama-walks-u-s-mexico-border-to-be-an-american-is-to-be-an-immigrant/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [362, 464, 1166, 1697, 2759, 3036, 3248, 3857, 4434, 6269, 6627, 6692, 7314, 7362]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1244, "scraper_regex": 1363}}, "headline": "Wilmer Valderrama walks U.S.-Mexico border: \"To be an American is to be an immigrant\"", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1363, "date": "20161102180000", "story_content": "Wilmer Valderrama played the clueless and lovable foreign exchange student Fez on \u201cThat \u201970s Show,\u201d but the actor is a real-life immigrant as well -- he moved to the U.S. from Venezuela in the early \u201990s.

It\u2019s a reminder to us of -- not only who we are, but what we are to this country. And it\u2019s about embodying your stories and to continue to retell your stories, because people need to hear. People need to be fueled again to say that it\u2019s not only okay to be an immigrant, but it is a gift to this country.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s why I felt like it was so important to do something like this. In a world where there\u2019s been so much negativity about the conversation, these people that come from the border towns also become our main examples and role models, and it makes us feel like you can [become a role model] too.\n\nWhen you were walking the U.S.-Mexico border, in Brownsville, Texas, what was your message to the people there \u2014 and in return, what did you learn from listening to their concerns and comments?\n\nAs I was walking the line I thought about how special it is to be so close to two cultures. To see the infusion of both cultures. To me, that was so unique. We all have a sense of pride about where we come from and our culture and who we are. But in this town, on a daily [basis] they\u2019re reminded of this bicultural and super diverse fusion of the flavors and I think that was something that really inspired me \u2014 is to see how effortless both cultures coexisted. It was almost like you were seeing the future. You were seeing what it\u2019s gotta be and what it has to be.\u00a0\n\nI also think some of the conversations I had there were the perception. There\u2019s so much perception behind the border towns and the problems. There\u2019s a lot of negativity that\u2019s been broadcasted about the border towns. But there is so much beauty to the border towns because \u2014\u00a0you know, I\u2019m talking about any border town; I\u2019m talking about the border towns between Canada and the United States, the border between Mexico and the United States \u2014 there\u2019s so much trade of cultural richness.\u00a0\n\nImmigration has been a really hot topic in this year\u2019s election. What do you think of the rhetoric that\u2019s been used throughout the campaign season by the presidential candidates?\n\nThere\u2019s so much to say and I think that if you know anything about what I\u2019ve been doing the last couple years as an activist, my frustration has been in the paraphrasing and the avoidance of the actual priority in conversation. I think immigration should be the number one topic. Why? Because that\u2019s what America is. To be an American is to be an immigrant. To be an immigrant is to look at America and see the American dream.\u00a0\n\nSo, they don\u2019t talk about the American dream. They don\u2019t talk about the fact that this country is the greatest country in the world because it has the melting pot of all the cultures coming together and the diversity of all the dreams together is what\u2019s strengthening us as a country. They\u2019re focusing on a lot of the combative fragment of this conversation. They forget there is an entire generation who are doing extraordinary things for the country that may or may not have documented or undocumented parents who also are suffering because of the possible division of it.\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s your overall message to immigrants who live in this country and how we should coexist in this country?\n\nAt the end, we should never forget that we\u2019re not just a guest in this country. This is also our home. We don\u2019t live in the guest house. We actually own the house too, and we should embrace a key role \u2014 that is to be a real member of the national community. If you are in this country then you belong here and if you or two people in your family are the only ones able to vote then you have to represent your family in that vote. It\u2019s about regaining that confidence back and showing up in this election.\n\nI do want to get an update on how your role as (Nick Torres) on \u201cNCIS\u201d has been? This is such a unique role. What was it like adapting to this character? What was the one of the biggest challenge for you with this character?\n\nIt was exciting because I haven\u2019t played a character like this before. I was excited to work with the producers and film writers and the writers to develop something that would be exciting for the existing fans of \u201cNCIS.\u201d And also, you know, a new character that would hopefully welcome another audience to come to this show. I also was excited by the diversity move that \u201cNCIS\u201d made by bringing in Jennifer Esposito and me and then Duane Henry. I think it painted a really great picture about Washington and how diverse that city is.\n\nExpect this guy to be breaking doors before knocking, and breaking certain rules and bending his own rules before asking Mark Harmon\u2019s character Gibbs for permission. He\u2019s the kind of guy who will just go ahead and do it before a plan. He\u2019s kind of a lone wolf and he doesn\u2019t play well with others, but he\u2019s learning to be part of the team. What\u2019s exciting about him is that he\u2019s very disruptive. He\u2019s really changing the dynamic between the squad room.\u00a0\n\nAlso, there is a notion to a possible love interest happening. There may be a little triangle happening at some point. There will be some kind of interesting conundrum for him at some point within the next year. There\u2019s some really big threads coming, and he will be a key component \u2014 not only solving those cases, but keeping the squad room safe as well.\u00a0\n\nAre there any other projects coming up that you\u2019re working on?\u00a0\n\nI had a pretty exciting year, not just joining \u201cNCIS,\u201d but also joining my co-stars [Ashton Kutcher] and [Danny Masterson] on \u201cThe Ranch\u201d and finishing up Season 3 of \u201cFrom Dusk till Dawn.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m also geared up to be the first Latin prince in the \u201cCharming\u201d movie by John Williams, the producer of the \u201cShrek\u201d franchise. It\u2019s really fun and funny and I came together with a bunch of amazing actors. We\u2019re doing basically an animated movie that is sort of a musical. I get to sing in it. I\u2019m definitely not terrible. I can hold a tune -- I\u2019ll tell you that. We\u2019re going to release a first look within the next two months.\u00a0\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.3104693889617898, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1244, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.69041575982, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 13, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161102180000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 2.65273311897106, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-f-35-fighter-jets-from-us-ash-carter-visits/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3569]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 530, "scraper_regex": 703}}, "headline": "Israel gets delivery of America's costliest war machine", "wordcount_as_scraped": 703, "date": "20161212160000", "story_content": "NEVATIM AIR FORCE BASE, Israel - The vanguard of Israel\u2019s new fleet of F-35 fighter jets roared onto the Nevatim air base Monday, ushering in a new era for Israeli air power and sharpening its military edge in a volatile Mideast.\n\nThe arrival of Israel\u2019s first two F-35 stealth aircraft also highlighted the Obama administration\u2019s commitment to providing its ally with the latest U.S. military advances.\n\nAn elaborate ceremony at Nevatim in southern Israel was delayed several hours because poor weather kept the F-35s from taking off from Italy for the flight to Israel.\n\nIn attendance were U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSpeaking shortly before the planes landed, Netanyahu thanked Carter and President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cWe value this commitment to the alliance with Israel,\u201d he said.\n\nNetanyahu issued a warning to Israel\u2019s enemies. \u201cI want to also say clearly, anyone who thinks to attack us will be attacked, anyone who thinks to destroy us is positioning themselves to an existential threat. That is a vital condition to ensure our future. History teaches us a simple thing: weak states don\u2019t survive,\u201d Netanyahu said in Hebrew.\n\nCarter said the U.S. \u201cis more committed to Israeli security than ever before,\u201d and the F-35s are evidence of that.\n\n\u201cFrom its stealth technology to its fighter capabilities, the F-35 will allow pilots to evade detection and fly at supersonic speeds while conducting air defense; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; or ground attack missions,\u201d Carter said.\n\nThe F-35 is considered to be the world\u2019s most sophisticated new warplane, equipped with stealth capabilities that allow it to evade or delay detection by the top radar systems. Israeli officials believe the plane will give them an advantage over their neighbors for years to come. They are committed to buying 50 of them.\n\nEarlier, the deputy commander of the Nevatim Air Force base in southern Israel said the new fighters will give Israel an upper hand over its neighbors for years to come.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be very strong for a long time, having these airplanes. And Israel has to be strong in this region for its existence,\u201d said Col. Asaf, who could be identified only by his first name in line with military regulations. \u201cIt\u2019s a message for everybody that Israel will keep on holding the high-end technology in this area.\u201d\n\nThe purchase of the F-35 elevates the entire Israeli air force to a higher level, the colonel said, adding that four Israeli pilots have been trained to fly the planes and that more will be shown how to use them.\n\n\u201cThis specific airplane is going to be a very good one for the next decades,\u201d he said.\n\nIn recent years, Israel has reportedly carried out long-range airstrikes as far away as Sudan, and is believed to have struck Hezbollah-bound weapons shipments in neighboring Syria.\n\nIsrael has also hinted in the past at making plans to strike Iran, some 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) away, if the Islamic Republic presses forward with its nuclear program. The threat of Israeli action in Iran has dropped since last year\u2019s nuclear accord.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s F-35 program has been criticized by members of the U.S. Congress over testing problems, delays and cost overruns. International buyers include Britain, South Korea, Israel, Italy, Australia, Canada, Turkey and Japan.\n\nWhile the planes were stuck in Italy, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump lashed out against the program. \u201cThe F-35 program and cost is out of control,\u201d he tweeted.\u00a0\n\nThe F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016\n\nJeff Babione, the executive vice president and general manager of the F-35 program at Lockheed Martin, defended the cost, saying that as production ramps up the price of an individual jet will fall to $85 million, \u201cin the 2019 or the 2020 timeframe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we get to $85 million dollars, the F-35 will be less expensive than any fourth-generation fighter in the world, and you\u2019ll have the premier fifth-generation fighter, so that\u2019s an incredible value for anyone operating the airplane,\u201d he told reporters at the base.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.84033614397049, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 530, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.6006197147, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161212160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.64150943396226, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-dish-chef-jody-adams/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [4875, 5775, 6544], "\u00a0": [495, 701, 732, 735, 925, 933, 1034, 1417, 1607, 2194, 2274, 2397, 2707, 2725, 2827, 2896, 3054, 3162, 3201, 3242, 3285, 3287, 3412, 3461, 3754, 3793, 3810, 3902, 3941, 4083, 4114, 4142, 4190, 4312, 4367, 4427, 4500, 4566, 4670, 4706, 4739, 4800, 4903, 5009, 5104, 5238, 5397, 5471, 5530, 5565, 5645, 5702, 5802, 5850, 6039, 6396, 6477, 6509, 6567, 6628, 6763, 6800, 6879, 6908], "\u00bd": [884, 1208, 3609, 3681, 4692, 6230], "\u00bc": [3517, 3632, 3791, 3939, 6093, 6153, 6189, 6212], "\u00be": [736]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1214, "scraper_regex": 1281}}, "headline": "The Dish: Chef Jody Adams", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1281, "date": "20161211020000", "story_content": "From winning a James Beard Award to the coveted title as \u201cBest New Chef\u201d from Food and Wine, Jody Adams has won her share of acclaim.

Since then, federal officials have recalled more than 1,800 items, which have been destroyed through target practice or otherwise disposed of, officials say.\n\nBut state and local police organizations have protested, insisting that military-style vehicles and gear help protect officers\u2019 lives and public safety - for example, a privately manufactured, tracked armored vehicle played a key role in the police response to the mass shooting at a county government building in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump sided with the police. In September, he promised to rescind the executive order in a written response to a Fraternal Order of Police questionnaire that helped him win an endorsement from the organization of rank-and-file officers.\n\n\u201cThe 1033 program is an excellent program that enhances community safety. I will rescind the current executive order,\u201d reads the response posted on the group\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWe take him at his word,\u201d Executive Director James Pasco said in a recent telephone interview.\n\nThe Trump transition team did not respond to questions from The Associated Press about the executive order.\n\nNational Sheriffs\u2019 Association Executive Director Jonathan F. Thompson said his group has pressed the topic in discussions with Trump\u2019s transition team. And William J. Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, said he was encouraged by his conversations with Trump representatives before the Nov. 8 election.\n\n\u201cThe feeling that we got is they absolutely hear us and they share our concerns,\u201d he said.\n\nObama\u2019s order was triggered partly by police use of military-style gear and vehicles in response to the 2014 unrest in Ferguson. The order prohibited the federal government from providing grenade launchers, bayonets, tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft and vehicles, and firearms and ammunition of .50-caliber or greater to state and local police agencies.\n\nSince then, the Defense Logistics Agency has recalled 138 grenade launchers, more than 1,600 bayonets and 126 tracked vehicles - those that run on continuous, tank-like tracks instead of wheels - that were provided through the military\u2019s 1033 program, agency spokeswoman Michelle McCaskill said.\n\nPeter Kraska, a professor at Eastern Kentucky University\u2019s School of Justice Studies who has studied the militarization of police, said Obama\u2019s executive order has had little effect because there was relatively little demand for the prohibited items to begin with.\n\n\u201cIt was more symbolic politics than anything substantive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe order also added requirements for record-keeping, local oversight and training for the acquisition or use of other surplus military equipment such as wheeled armored vehicles, but those hurdles apparently have not deterred agencies from obtaining the gear. McCaskill said 183 law enforcement agencies have received mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles or MRAPs, through the 1033 program so far this year. That\u2019s more than the 165 MRAPs that were distributed in 2013.\n\nNevertheless, Kraska said, there\u2019s nothing to justify most police departments having such equipment.\n\n\u201cIt just ramps up the probability that this kind of kind of high-end military hardware is going to be misapplied,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Cass County, North Dakota, Sheriff Paul Laney said the executive order is aimed at urban areas and ignores the usefulness of tracked vehicles in rugged terrain.\n\n\u201cThey fail to realize the dilemma it puts sheriffs in who live in the rural areas, the desert areas, the mountain areas,\u201d he said.\n\nOakland County, Michigan, Sheriff Michael Bouchard, whose tracked vehicle was recalled, said rescinding the order would restore police access to equipment they\u2019ve been denied for what he called \u201cpurely optic\u201d reasons.\n\nGroups on both ends of the political spectrum have expressed concern about police militarization, from civil-rights organizations such as the NAACP and ACLU to the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nRaed Jarrar, government relations manager for the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group committed to peace and social justice, said the executive order wasn\u2019t effective but rescinding it would send a message that \u201crather than attempting to curb militarism, the president-elect is planning to continue on that path.\u201d\n\nThe Charles Koch Institute, founded by its conservative billionaire namesake, considers the restrictions under Obama\u2019s executive order \u201ca decent start,\u201d said William Ruger, vice president of policy and research.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want local police departments to be incentivized to get the types of equipment that in most cases are a better fit for the war zone,\u201d he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.6867469549179097, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 743, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 14, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.44060899703, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161211200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.576043068640651, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/n-c-governor-pledges-to-immediately-expand-medicaid-under-obamacare/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 667, "scraper_regex": 705}}, "headline": "N.C. governor pledges to immediately expand Medicaid under Obamacare", "wordcount_as_scraped": 705, "date": "20170105160000", "story_content": "RALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 Setting up more conflict with the Republican-led legislature, new North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper on Wednesday announced plans to expand Medicaid through the federal health care overhaul, even though a state law specially prevents such unilateral action.\n\nCooper, the attorney general for the past 16 years before narrowly beating GOP Gov. Pat McCrory in November, announced at a New-Year economic forum that he plans to file paperwork with federal regulators by Friday.\n\nCooper\u2019s action comes in the waning days of the administration of President Barack Obama, who championed the 2010 health care law and wants to protect his legacy, and as President-elect Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders pledge to repeal it.\n\nAs many as 650,000 working people who can\u2019t get private insurance or otherwise make too much to get Medicaid could benefit, generating jobs, helping rural hospitals and boosting the economy, Cooper said. Under the proposal, the state would have to match 5 percent of the cost, which the governor said could come from an assessment on hospitals that stand to benefit.\n\n\u201cWe have to accept Medicaid expansion that is being offered to our state,\u201d Cooper told business leaders in Durham.\n\nThe governor, sworn in just last weekend, will be hard-pressed to bypass a 2013 state law approved by McCrory and GOP legislators that declares North Carolina won\u2019t expand Medicaid and says the General Assembly must sign off on any proposal by state officials to do so. Other laws leave it to the General Assembly alone to determine who is eligible for the state Medicaid program, which currently covers 1.9 million people.\n\nGOP legislative leaders said Cooper would be violating state law if he went forward. The lawmakers planned to ask Congress and federal Medicaid regulators to reject Cooper\u2019s request.\n\nCooper \u201calready intends to violate his oath of office with a brazenly illegal attempt to force a massive, budget-busting Obamacare expansion on North Carolina taxpayers,\u201d Senate leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, said in a news release.\n\nBut Cooper said after his speech that the 2013 law intrudes upon a governor\u2019s \u201ccore executive authority\u201d to accept federal funds and look out for the public\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cI would hope that they would not try to stop us, but I believe it would be important to get their input, so I\u2019m looking forward to that input as we go forward,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nBerger\u2019s House counterparts also jumped on Cooper\u2019s comments that the state\u2019s share, potentially in the tens of millions of dollars initially, could come from taxpayers or the hospitals \u2014 proof that he wants to raise taxes, they said. The state match rises to 10 percent in 2020.\n\nHealth-related associations praised Cooper\u2019s move, but with caution. \u201cGiven the complexity of the issue and the process, we believe coverage expansion can only happen through a bipartisan, collaborative effort,\u201d the North Carolina Hospital Association said in a release.\n\nCooper already has sued Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore over a law the General Assembly approved two weeks before he took office that would weaken his authority to oversee state elections. That law has been temporarily delayed. A hearing to block its enforcement longer is slated for Thursday.\n\nNorth Carolina is one of 19 states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid through Obama\u2019s signature legislation. Republicans in Raleigh said in 2013 it was the wrong time to expand Medicaid because of the state program\u2019s fiscal shortfalls and they couldn\u2019t trust the federal government to continue paying for most of it.\n\nNorth Carolina Medicaid has been in the black for the past three years. In 2015, state lawmakers and McCrory agreed to rework the system, replacing a fee-for-service structure with one in which insurers receive a fixed monthly amount to care for patients.\n\nCooper may want to get expansion approved before Obama leaves office, given Medicaid expansion\u2019s uncertain future under a Trump administration \u2014 and before the state negotiates details of the ongoing reform with the federal government, said Don Taylor, a Duke University professor specializing in health care policy.\n\n\u201cWe found very receptive people in Washington who are working with us and who are ready to do this\u201d expansion, Cooper said, without identifying them.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.41095891594886796, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 667, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.98343678186, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.8980509745127403, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-carolina-republicans-strip-new-democratic-governor-of-some-power/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [221]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 744, "scraper_regex": 801}}, "headline": "North Carolina Republicans strip new Democratic governor of some power", "wordcount_as_scraped": 801, "date": "20161217000000", "story_content": "RALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina Republicans stripped the incoming Democratic governor of some of his authority on Friday and they were on the cusp of an\u00a0even greater power grab, an extraordinary move that critics said flies in the face of voters.\n\nJust last week, it appeared Republicans were ready to finally accept Democrats\u2019 narrow win in a contentious governor\u2019s race. As it turns out, they weren\u2019t done fighting. In a surprise special session in the dying days of the old administration, some say the Republican-dominated legislature has thrown the government into total disarray, approving at least one bill aimed at emasculating incoming Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s administration.\n\nCooper, the current attorney general, has threatened to sue. And many in the state are accusing Republicans of letting sour grapes over losing the governor\u2019s mansion turn into a legislative coup.\n\n\u201cThis was a pure power grab,\u201d said retired school librarian Carolyn White, 62, a long-time demonstrator who was arrested as part of the \u201cMoral Monday\u201d protests against GOP-led legislative policies. \u201cI got arrested two years ago. Did it make any difference? No. But just like the civil rights movement, it\u2019s forward together. You just have to keep going forward.\u201d\n\nThe protesters were so loud that Senate and House cleared the galleries \u2014 a highly unusual move. Dozens of people were arrested this week, and as demonstrators were led away from the Legislative Building, some chanted \u201call political power comes from the people.\u201d Those that remained behind could only watch the debate through glass windows or listen to it online.\n\nMore arrests happening now on 3rd floor of #ncga @Wncn pic.twitter.com/phww9s1baO\u2014 Michael Hyland (@MichaelWNCN) December 16, 2016\n\nHundreds stomped their feet or banged on windows outside the gallery, causing several Republican lawmakers to note they were having trouble hearing during the debate. Democrats repeatedly stated their objections.\n\n\u201cThe kindergartners are getting rowdy,\u201d said Republican Rep. Dana Bumgardner.\n\nShe said Democrats were \u201ccreating out of thin air a talking point for the next election.\u201d\n\nRepublican Gov. Pat McCrory, who lost to Cooper by about 10,000 votes, quickly signed into law a bill that merges the State Board of Elections and State Ethics Commission into one board comprised equally of Democrats and Republicans, according to documents from General Assembly staff. The previous state elections board law would have allowed Cooper to put a majority of Democrats on the panel.\n\nThe law would also make elections for appellate court judgeships officially partisan again.\n\nAnother bill that received final legislative approval would force Cooper\u2019s Cabinet choices to be subject to Senate confirmation.\n\nMcCrory must decide whether to sign the second law passed by a General Assembly that has repeatedly tugged the man who campaigned as a moderate in 2012 as Charlotte\u2019s moderate former mayor into hard-right turf. Lawmakers\u2019 veto-proof majorities since 2013 and the uncompetitive election districts they drew have allowed legislative Republicans to ignore Democratic viewpoints and sometimes McCrory\u2019s desires.\n\nRepublicans insist the legislation is simply adjusting the constitutional powers already granted to the General Assembly. Many of the provisions had been debated for years but always got set aside.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably no better time than to deal with it in the present,\u201d said Republican Rep. Bert Jones.\n\nDemocrats said it was an attempt by the GOP to cling to power a week after the Republican incumbent conceded.\n\n\u201cI really fear that we have harmed our reputation and integrity this week,\u201d said Rep. Billy Richardson, a Democrat.\n\nRepublicans gained power of both legislative chambers in 2010 for the first time in more than a century, and they have veto-proof majorities, holding 108 of 170 seats even though the state has been more closely divided in recent statewide and federal elections.\n\nNorth Carolina is a presidential battleground state that Barack Obama won in 2008 by just over 14,000 votes. Four years later, Mitt Romney edged Obama by about 92,000 votes. Donald Trump won in November.\n\nGOP legislators have been able to expand their majorities thanks to approving redistricting maps in 2011. But nearly 30 of those legislative districts were struck down last summer. A federal court has directed updated maps be approved by March 15.\n\nCooper ran on a platform of defeating Republicans\u2019 agenda, saying he would work to repeal a law known as House Bill 2 that limits LGBT rights.\n\n\u201cIf I believe that laws passed by the legislature hurt working families and are unconstitutional, they will see me in court,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nRepublicans pointed to past sessions of the General Assembly, when it was dominated by Democrats. Democrats stripped the powers of the first and only GOP lieutenant governor of the 20th Century in the late 1980s. But Democrats said there\u2019s been no such widespread effort to limit the power of an incoming executive before he took office.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.3498759269714395, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 1, "wordcount": 744, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.9750509984, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161217000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.82258064516129, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-election-that-forgot-americas-disabled/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2916, 6221, 6566, 8669]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1395, "scraper_regex": 1540}}, "headline": "The election that forgot America's disabled", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1540, "date": "20161104110000", "story_content": "Last Updated Nov 4, 2016 10:00 AM EDT\n\nMy favorite food on the campaign trail is the spicy chicken sandwich from Wendy\u2019s. I ate one last week in Toledo after a Joe Biden campaign rally. Over the past year, I\u2019ve eaten at Wendy\u2019s all across America: In airports and small towns, at all hours of the day, between sprints to campaign events for the presidential candidates I\u2019ve been tasked to cover over the past 500 days.\n\nBut my favorite Wendy\u2019s sits at the crest of a two-lane road in upstate New York, across from a Greek restaurant and a firehouse. It\u2019s a highway exit away from a school and residential facility my older sister Ellen has called home since she was 14-years-old. She was born with cerebral palsy.\n\nOver the years, the fast food stop became a family staple, enjoyed together during our weekend visits. My sister can eat her favorite order, a broccoli-and-cheddar baked potato and a cheeseburger, with a fork and knife, but her motor skills are seriously impaired.\n\nEllen suffered from severe brain damage in my mother\u2019s womb, shortly before she was born in 1985.\n\nThanks to the support she receives at school and in her home, Ellen lives a purposeful and happy life. She works the local farm, has friends, and even attended prom when she turned 18. Forget the word \u201cdisability\u201d -- thrown around with nonchalance by both presidential candidates this election year -- Ellen makes everyone she touches better, more patient and more present.\n\nShe forces people to consider those who might not be able to speak for themselves. Ellen is the reason I am a journalist.\n\nMy sister works harder in her most mundane hours than most of us do inside our campaign bubble, spending our days grousing about travel, tweeting minutiae and pontificating about the 2016 race from the catered comforts of a network greenroom.\n\nSo much of this election has unfolded with my head buried in my iPhone, reading about an election that often feels disconnected from the lives of ordinary people. In that Wendy\u2019s in upstate New York, where families take their disabled relatives out for a special lunch, cable coverage of the campaign does not blare over people\u2019s meals. It is irrelevant. Before anything else, there is a pervasive concern for the future of those who can\u2019t plan their own, or even plan their next day.\n\nThere is a single dominant image of the disabled in this campaign: Donald Trump\u2019s November 2015 mockery of Serge Kovaleski, a New York Times reporter who refuted Trump\u2019s November 2015 claim that he had seen \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of Arabs in New Jersey cheering as the World Trade Center buildings collapsed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I said -- uhhhh -- I don\u2019t remember,\u201d Trump said, with his arms flailing from the elbow at an odd angle in what was seen as an imitation of Kovaleski\u2019s disability. He was born with arthrogryposis, a condition that affects his joints.\u00a0\n\nThat clip of Trump has been replayed an untold number of times, on news shows and in an avalanche of advertisements funded by Hillary Clinton and her allies, all designed to maximize the shock of seeing what Trump\u2019s flailing arms and mockery look must look like to children and to the disabled who watch him on screen.\n\nBut as is the case with much of Trump\u2019s disparaging rhetoric this cycle, some voters and experts say it\u2019s taken the conversation about disabled people in the wrong direction.\n\n\u201cIt has definitely undone a lot of people\u2019s work to mainstream people with special needs, and not view them differently,\u201d said Sandra Clark, a Cleveland voter who stood in the crowd at Bill Clinton rally last weekend. \u201cWe have a lot of special needs in our family and it\u2019s very discouraging.\u201d\n\nClark attended Clinton\u2019s rally in Cleveland with her two special-needs children in tow. She had recently picked up her life in Kansas and moved to Cleveland to take care of her nephews, because her ailing sister has Alzheimer\u2019s. Clark came to the event on Saturday, she told me, because she was seeking information she hadn\u2019t heard from the media.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about he-said she-said, and it\u2019s nothing about the issues,\u201d Clark said.\n\nWhen we talk about people with disabilities in this election, we are simply talking about name-calling. To people like Clark, no one in the campaign is articulating how we can improve the lives of the 57 million Americans with special needs, many who will be voting themselves.\n\n\u201cWhat Trump has done is give license to say that people with disabilities are not worth as much as the rest of us,\u201d said Sue Constantino, the CEO of the Cerebral Palsy Association of New York State. \u201cWe have made such great strides in our world over the last 20 years in terms of the acceptance of people with disabilities. Something like this, even if he doesn\u2019t mean it, can really set us back.\u201d\n\nThose who work in the disability field would prefer to be discussing more granular policy matters. For instance, how the federal government can work more closely with states to provide better, more individualized care and invest in more research going forward.\n\nBut that\u2019s not happening.\n\nTrump has not mentioned a plan for research or improved care for the disabled, and there is nothing on his website on this issue. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has a history of relationships with people with disabilities; she has incorporated people with disabilities into her campaign and given them featured speaking spots during her nominating convention. Clinton also has a detailed plan to help families struggling with autism. Her campaign also points out that there are ASL (American Sign Language) signers at every event, and it has even made its campaign buttons in Braille.\n\nOverall, though, there has been little actual discussion on the campaign trail, or in the press, about what either of the candidates would actually do to help disabled Americans.\n\nLast year, the country celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a landmark civil rights law to fight discrimination against people with special needs. But there remains a shortage of funding and research that prevents schools and facilities from caring for disabled Americans in the most appropriate, case-by-case way. \u00a0\n\nWhere my sister lives in New York is a bright spot. Set on sprawling bucolic farmland, the adult and pediatric rehabilitation facility offers a variety of state-of-the-art programs and residential services along with robust research initiatives.\n\nBut she and my family are lucky. Access to such highly specific treatment and support is rare. \u00a0\n\nNew York has been able to establish more sophisticated programs for people with special needs, but expert say systems in most states are dramatically underfunded.\n\nBlock granting Medicaid funding into the hands of state governments, as Trump intends to do, would be \u201cvery troublesome,\u201d according to Constantino. Budget cuts by state leaders trying to trim costs could have serious consequences for the majority of disabled people who depend on Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe are really quite frightened about that,\u201d Constantino added.\n\nOverall, the process of navigating the byzantine rules and regulations set by the government to obtain personalized support or treatment can be prohibitive.\n\nBut the conversation is about more than just policy prescriptions. The Supreme Court, with one glaring vacant seat, will decide on several disabilities-focused court cases in the coming years. Clinton or Trump will appoint the justices who will rule on them.\n\nWhen it comes to the law, Trump has run afoul of the Americans with Disabilities Act repeatedly over the years, having been sued for violating requirements that public places offer accessibility to those with special needs. He attempted to fight several of the violations and eventually settled; in only two of the cases did he actually make adjustments to the building.\n\nMeanwhile, it was recently reported that Trump routinely called a former deaf contestant on The Apprentice, Marlee Matlin, \u201cretarded,\u201d while filming the reality TV show.\n\n\u201cThe term is abhorrent and should never be used,\u201d the actress wrote in a response to Trump on Twitter. \u201cThe fact that we are talking about this during a very important moment in American history has upset me deeply.\u201d\n\nThat Trump allegedly has the capacity to talk in such a way -- and that he has never mentioned his personal connection to cerebral palsy in the form of his great nephew, William Trump, who was born with the condition -- might speak to the lingering stigma of shame and weakness associated with disabilities. Looked at another way, though, what Trump has said could wind up helping people.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe conversation about how people with disabilities are disparaged, and that it should not be tolerated, has been a very positive event,\u201d Michael Kirkman, the Executive Director at Ohio Disability Rights Law and Policy Center, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s empowered my friends with disabilities, who now feel really motivated to go be part of the electoral process.\u201d\n\nAnd when they do vote in November, I\u2019m hoping they stop at a place like Wendy\u2019s on the way home, and think of people like Ellen.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.7722771167755096, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1395, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.8719216361699997, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161104110000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 1.9354838709677402, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-carolina-governo-race-recount-to-continue-after-board-of-elections-dismisses-complaint/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [523, 895]}}, "headline": "N.C. governor's race recount to continue", "wordcount_as_scraped": 555, "date": "20161204050000", "story_content": "RALEIGH, N.C. --The State Board of Elections dismissed a complaint originating from a rural North Carolina county that could have prevented scores of ballots from being counted in close races for governor and auditor. The board voted 3-2 on Saturday to reject the protest from a Bladen County candidate, who with assistance from Republican Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s campaign, alleged workers for a political committee that received Democratic funds fraudulently filled out absentee ballots.\u00a0\n\nLawyers pushing the complaint suggested the board could throw out as many as 419 mail-in absentee ballots. They said evidence showed that a losing write-in candidate for soil and water conservation district supervisor showed up on nearly 170 ballots and may have originated from only seven people. The lawyers said none of those ballots should be tallied for any races.\u00a0\n\nRemoving hundreds of ballots from Bladen County wouldn\u2019t have a major impact on the top races, but could play a role in whether there is a statewide recount. Democrat Roy Cooper leads McCrory by about 10,250 votes while Democratic State Auditor Beth Wood leads Republican Chuck Stuber by nearly 6,000 votes. A trailing candidate can receive a statewide recount if the margin is 10,000 votes or less. Republican elections board member James Baker joined the panel\u2019s two Democrats in dismissing the complaint, saying voters signed the absentee ballots. There was no substantial evidence to suggest the choices weren\u2019t their own, they said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we could deprive them of their vote ... for every other race because we have some pretty serious misgivings about the soil and water race,\u201d Baker said at the close of four hours of testimony and discussion. The board\u2019s other two Republicans voted against dismissal. The state board, which has been scrutinizing this fall\u2019s election and absentee ballots in Bladen County, did vote unanimously to send what its investigators have uncovered to the U.S. attorney in Raleigh. The board has not disclosed what it has found. Roger Knight, a McCrory campaign attorney, said he didn\u2019t believe the dismissal would be appealed to court unless the margin with Cooper narrowed. McCrory said in a release Saturday night he would also ask the State Bureau of Investigation to examine the Bladen County voting to \u201censure that every vote is counted accurately and that our elections process is conducted legally.\u201d Irving Joyner, an attorney representing the Bladen political committee, said workers complied with state law in helping people cast write-in votes on absentee ballots and that adding a write-in candidate alone isn\u2019t unlawful. McCrory has suggested he wouldn\u2019t demand a statewide recount if a review of more than 94,000 votes in Durham County showed the same results. Durham County workers began the recount Saturday - a day earlier than previously scheduled - and counted almost 20,000 votes. They resume work Sunday and are supposed to be done by Monday night. The State Board of Elections ordered the Durham recount of ballots tabulated during early voting and at one Election Day precinct. Technical challenges on election night led to a late release of those ballot totals, flipping the statewide leader from McCrory to Cooper. \u201cWe need to move forward and get this done,\u201d Durham board Chairman Bill Brian said Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted by it and I think (Durham) is exhausted by it.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.52733683586121, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 535, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.67217062849, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161204050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8037383177570097, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-glow-of-moonlight/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1920, 2049, 6835, 6837, 6839, 6840]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1090, "scraper_regex": 1238}}, "headline": "The glow of \u201cMoonlight\u201d", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1238, "date": "20170129160000", "story_content": "\u201cMoonlight\u201d is a coming-of-age movie that\u2019s come in for a lot of critical acclaim, not to mention a bundle of Oscar nominations.    So, will they call out its name after they ask for THE ENVELOPE PLEASE? Here\u2019s Nancy Giles:\n\nA timid boy named Chiron is having a tough time growing up in Liberty City, one of Miami\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. \n\nKevin: \u201cYou funny, man.\u201dChiron: \u201cWhy you say that?\u201dKevin: \u201cYou just is, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nThe other kids taunt Chiron because he\u2019s different.\n\nPaula: \u201cYou ever see the way he walk, Juan?\u201dJuan: \u201cYou watch your damn mouth.\u201dPaula: \u201cYou gonna tell him why the other boys kick his ass all the time, huh?\u201d\n\nHis single mom is a crack addict, his surrogate parents the local drug dealer and his girlfriend.\n\n\u201cMoonlight\u201d is one of the season\u2019s most-talked-about films. It won the Golden Globe for Best Picture-Drama, and it was just nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Not bad for an independent film made in just 25 days for less than $5 million.\n\nIn addition to Best Picture, Barry Jenkins has two more Oscar nominations for \u201cMoonlight\u201d: Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nGiles asked Jenkins, \u201cHave people noticed, by the way, that there are no white characters in the movie?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have noticed, yeah,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou know, it wasn\u2019t a conscious decision, but, you know, I didn\u2019t know any white people who weren\u2019t teachers until I was, like, a freshman in college. And I walked in and my roommate was white. I didn\u2019t have any white friends. There were just no white people around. And we tried to have fidelity to the world the characters live in.\u201d\n\nJenkins and playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney both grew up in Liberty City; they know the neighborhood where the film takes place. They both attended the same elementary school, at different times. \n\nMcCraney wrote the original script upon which Barry Jenkins based \u201cMoonlight.\u201d\u00a0 They lived a few blocks away from each other in Liberty City, but didn\u2019t actually meet until they started working on the movie.\u00a0 While McCraney is gay and Jenkins is straight, they say they put a lot of themselves into the story, such as a fight scene involving the central character.\n\n\u201cIt happened in that space,\u201d McCraney said. \u201cAnd it was probably one of the most terrifying moments for me, \u2018cause it was always -- you just never knew what was gonna happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo lunch time could be a really terrifying time for you?\u201d Giles asked. \n\n\u201cYeah, lunch time was never a time for eating.\u201d\n\nMcCraney, a Macarthur \u201cGenius grant\u201d recipient, and Jenkins share a terrible coincidence: both of their mothers were crack users, and both became HIV positive as a result.\n\n\u201cI do know that there was a deep pain that she was trying to hide, that she was trying to alleviate,\u201d McCraney said. \n\nBritish actress Naomie Harris has portrayed a sea goddess in \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and Winnie Mandela, among other roles. To play Chiron\u2019s mom (for which she\u2019s received a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination), Harris watched YouTube interviews with crack users, and met with a woman who struggled with addiction. \n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand this concept,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe know how destructive drugs are. So how does somebody get attracted to that, you know? And she has a son. And so I had so much judgment, actually, and I really had to work very hard to overcome that judgment. \n\n\u201cWhat you do as an actor is you\u2019re inhabiting souls. And you\u2019re asking those souls to come into your space. And you could only do that in a non-judgmental way.\u201d\n\nChiron is actually portrayed at three ages by three different actors. But to play little Chiron, 12-year-old Alex Hibbert didn\u2019t do the preparation that the other, more experienced performers did.\n\nHow did he do it? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just went with what they told me to do, and then I just got into the character that they told me to be, and just went on from there.\u201d\n\nHibbert, also from Miami near Liberty City, had acted in school plays, but never in a movie. \n\nMahershala Ali said, \u201cAlex is the best scene partner that I\u2019ve ever had. I say that sincerely. He\u2019s so wise for his age. He was such a professional, but he\u2019s also a kid.\u201d\n\nAli, whom you may recognize from \u201cHidden Figures\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d plays the Hibbert\u2019s character\u2019s father figure.\n\n\u201cWhat I learned in working with him was to try to do less and work to not act,\u201d Ali said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an important reminder for someone like myself who\u2019s been very fortunate to be working for a couple of decades now.\u201d\n\nGiles asked Hibbert, \u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazing, because same to him,\u201d he replied.\n\nAli (now a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee) shares two memorable scenes with Hibbert: one in which Chiron learns to swim.\n\nJenkins explained, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is Alex Hibbert, our non-actor, actually does not know how to swim. And Mahershala is actually teaching him how to swim as this storm is coming in off the coast.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s another scene, in which Chiron learns who he is.\n\nChiron: \u201cWhat\u2019s a faggot?\u201dJuan: \u201cA faggot is ... a word used to make gay people feel bad.\u201dChiron: \u201cAm I a faggot?\u201dJuan: \u201cNo. No. You could be gay, but don\u2019t let anybody call you no faggot.\u201dChron: \u201cHow do I know?\u201dJuan: \u201cYou just do.\u201d\n\nGiles asked, \u201cWhen you typed the word \u2018faggot\u2019 for the first time, and you saw it on the page, what did you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cBomb!\u201d Jenkins laughed. \u201cI thought it was a bomb. Yeah, it was scary.\u201d\n\nHibbert added, \u201cAt first I was watching to see if my mom was there, \u2018cause my mom is very strict and she doesn\u2019t like me saying \u2018words.\u2019\u201d\n\nAli said of filming that scene, \u201cIt felt sacred that day, it really did. I felt like we made a little bit of magic that day.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoonlight\u201d is far from a blockbuster; it\u2019s made just $16 million so far. But its eight Oscar nods and critical acclaim may help the movie reach a larger audience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to learn about people who haven\u2019t had an opportunity to speak for themselves,\u201d Ali said. \n\nJenkins said, \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to remind, reinforce people that their lives have value, you know? That their lives have worth.\u201d\n\nHarris added, \u201cIt bypasses the mind and it speaks straight to your heart, and also it shows just how, like, we all on some level are damaged. And we are all coming from this wounded place in our search for connection and love. And I think just seeing that really helps people understand their journey and helps people understand each other. And I think now, more than ever, we need that reminder.\u201d\n\nGiles asked Hibbert, \u201cHow are your friends reacting to all of this?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re all, like, \u2018Alex, you\u2019re a big movie star now. Slide me some change!\u2019\u201d he laughed. \n\n\u201cAnd what do you do when they say, \u2018Slide me some change\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI be, like, \u2018I got you,\u2019 but \u2026\u201d Hibbert laughed. \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0For more info:", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.5447154045105, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1090, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 7, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.05703790891, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170129160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.37614678899083, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/air-ambulance-plane-crash-kills-4-in-elko-northern-nevada/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [63, 528, 846]}}, "headline": "Air ambulance plane crash kills 4 in northern Nevada", "wordcount_as_scraped": 530, "date": "20161120010000", "story_content": "ELKO, Nev. \u00a0-- An air-ambulance plane taking a heart-disease patient to a Utah hospital crashed in a parking lot in northern Nevada, killing all four people aboard and sending up explosions and flames. Three crew members and a patient were killed in the Friday night crash in Elko, American Medflight said Saturday in a statement. \n\nAccording to Elko cardiologist Dr. Rodney Badger, the plane was carrying a heart patient to the University of Utah, CBS affiliate KTVN reports.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere was not a lot left of the aircraft,\u201d said Elko Fire Chief Matt Griego.\n\nElko police Lt. Rich Genseal said the twin-engine plane apparently \u201cexperienced mechanical problems\u201d as it was climbing after taking off on a flight for Salt Lake City, then lost altitude and crashed, the Elko Daily Free Press reported.\u00a0\n\nThe identities of the victims were not released by authorities, but Debbi and Jim Urresti of Elko, said their 29-year-old daughter, Tiffany, was killed in the crash. The twin-engine plane crashed in a mining company\u2019s parking lot near a casino and other businesses near Elko Regional Airport and Interstate 80. \n\nAmerican Medflight, which is based in Reno, Nevada, did not immediately respond to email and telephone requests for comment. But President John Burruel said in a statement that the company was cooperating with the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration as they investigated the crash. \u201cAs an air medical family, we are mourning the loss of our crewmembers and patient.  Their families have been notified, and they are in our thoughts and prayers,\u201d Burruel said. Tiffany Urresti\u2019s parents said she was a former hospital ER nurse who dreamed for years of working as a flight nurse. Urresti achieved her dream, starting work for American Medflight two months ago, and she was engaged to be married in May, Debibi Urresti said. \u201cShe found the love of her life.\u201d Local authorities did not immediately respond to email and phone requests for comment, but Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer said nobody on the ground was hurt. \u201cThere was not a lot left of the aircraft,\u201d Elko Fire Chief Matt Griego said after the flames were extinguished. A photograph published by the Elko Daily Free Press showed mostly burned wreckage on pavement in front of a line of vehicles, including at least one charred pickup. The plane\u2019s tail was one of the few recognizable parts. Hillary Walker, a manager at a grocery store about 200 yards from the crash, told the Las Vegas Review Journal that the crash caused parked vehicles to catch fire and then dozens of rounds of ammunition to go off. Walker noted that said a number of vehicles in the parking lot for mine workers likely had ammunition in them. \u201cIt\u2019s hunting season out here,\u201d she said. Dr. Rodney Badger of Northeastern Nevada Cardiology told the Daily Free Press that the plane had just taken off from the nearby airport to transport a patient to the University of Utah Medical Center. Badger said his patient suffered from coronary artery disease and was experiencing chest pains and rapid heartbeat around 5:30 p.m., after which the decision was made to transport him to Utah.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.47349166870117, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 525, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.448481477740001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161120010000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.52380952380952, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gunmen-attack-state-prosecutors-office-in-cancun-mexico-3-dead/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [625, 904, 1421, 2427, 2463, 2484, 2576, 3000, 3151]}}, "headline": "4 dead after gunmen attack state prosecutors\u2019 office in Cancun, police say", "wordcount_as_scraped": 682, "date": "20170118030000", "story_content": "Last Updated Jan 17, 2017 11:32 PM EST\n\nCANCUN, Mexico -- Gunmen attacked the state prosecutors\u2019 office in this Caribbean resort city Tuesday, and authorities said four people were killed, ratcheting up tensions just a day after a shooting at a music festival in a nearby town left three foreigners and two Mexicans dead. It was too early to say if the attacks were linked, but they were a marked intrusion of bloodshed into Mexico\u2019s main tourism zone, a region that had previously been spared much of the violence plaguing other parts of the country.\u00a0\n\nThe governor of Quintana Roo state, Carlos Joaquin, said three attackers and one police officer died in Tuesday\u2019s incident. He said five suspected attackers were taken into custody. He urged calmed, saying the federal government was sending more security forces to the region.\u00a0\n\nA witness said the attackers also tossed two explosive devices at a perimeter wall. A reporter at the scene saw police remove a body from a guard post near the building after the attack. Earlier in the day, the hypothesis of drug links to the shooting in nearby Playa del Carmen before dawn Monday was strengthened after a banner briefly appeared along a roadside, signed by the \u201cOld School Zetas,\u201d part of the fragmented Zetas cartel, suggesting the attack was carried out as part of a battle against rival gangs.\u00a0\n\nQuintana Roo\u2019s attorney general, Miguel Angel Pech, said investigators were looking into whether the banner referred to the BPM music festival or one of its organizers. Pech said authorities were investigating whether extortion, street-level drug sales or a murder plot was the motive behind the shooting at the closing party for the BPM electronic music festival. Five people died and 15 suffered injuries. Pech said the gunman fired directly at one of the Mexican victims at the Blue Parrot nightclub where the party was being held. A confused shootout ensued in which guards -- it is not clear whether festival security personnel or the Mexican\u2019s bodyguards - returned fire. One guard was hit by gunfire, and as he fell, his pistol went off, wounding several concert-goers, Pech said. It was unclear why the Mexican man might have been a target. Pech said his family told prosecutors that he had \u201can important relative\u201d in the state government of Veracruz, a state plagued by corruption and violence.\u00a0\n\nA Denver teen was among the dead,\u00a0CBS Denver reported.\u00a0Alejandra Villanueva\u2019s family said she was among those who were trampled, the station said.\u00a0\n\nThe attacker fled, but Pech told the Televisa TV network that a taxi driver who helped the man escape has been linked to previous extortion attempts. Some businesses in Mexico are forced to pay protection money under threat of being attacked. \u201cEither they didn\u2019t reach an agreement over protection payments, directly extortion, or it may be that somebody did not allow them to sell drugs inside\u201d the nightclub, Pech said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPerhaps the strongest hypothesis is that this person had gone there to demand they comply with protection payments,\u201d he added at a news conference.\u00a0\n\nPlaya del Carmen residents said the shooting came amid a growing and increasingly open drug scene in the resort town, which has long been spared the violence of Mexico\u2019s cartel wars. Concerns that violence may be creeping into the once-tranquil beachside town were voiced as people attended a Monday evening vigil in front of the Blue Parrot nightclub. \u201cThis is a sign of what has been happening,\u201d said Lenin Amaro, a local business owner and politician. \u201cIt has reached us,\u201d Amaro said of the country\u2019s drug violence. \u201cWe were living in what you could call a bubble.\u201d Federal authorities say the Zeta cartel has been in the state for years, especially in Cancun itself, where the Zetas were blamed for the firebombing of a bar in which eight people died in 2010. And drug cartel influence in the state as a whole goes back at least to the 1990s under Gov. Mario Villanueva, who was later convicted in the U.S. of involvement in large-scale drug smuggling.

Commandos set up checkpoints and intercepted a vehicle carrying several ISIS militants, killing all of them and flying off with the bodies, he said.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, another activist-run group, said 25 militants were killed in the ambush.\n\nAlmost all of Deir el-Zour province, which sits along Syria\u2019s border with Iraq, remains under ISIS control, and the U.S. has carried out airstrikes targeting the group there for more than a year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an operation that apparently targeted an important figure,\u201d Abou Leila told The Associated Press from Germany, where he is based. Deir Ezzor 24 is one of several locally staffed underground groups reporting from ISIS-held territory.\n\nThe U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad who confirmed the raid did not say which senior ISIS members might have been targeted, however, and there was no indication that the group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was at either of the two sites hit by American forces.\n\nSyrian President Bashar Assad said in remarks published Monday, meanwhile, that he was prepared \u201cto negotiate everything\u201d at planned talks later this month in Kazakhstan, seeking to cast himself as a peacemaker after his forces\u2019 recapture of Aleppo last month.\n\nHowever, the upcoming talks, brokered by Ankara and Moscow, are still in doubt as Syrian opposition groups have yet to confirm their participation. The main opposition umbrella group said less than two weeks ago that it was suspending all discussions about the pending talks because Russian and Syrian forces were, according to the rebels, violating the tenuous cease-fire in the country.\n\nSpeaking to French reporters at his Damascus palace, Assad defended his troops\u2019 deadly bombardment of eastern Aleppo, saying the alternative would have been to leave the city\u2019s civilians to the mercy of \u201cterrorists\u201d -- a term the government uses for all rebels.\n\nAssad questioned the credibility of Syrian opposition groups backed by the West and Saudi Arabia, which make up the bulk of the armed and political opposition to his rule.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no limit to negotiations,\u201d Assad said, in remarks carried by Syrian state media. \u201cBut who is going to be there from the other side, we don\u2019t know yet. ... The viability of the conference depends on that.\u201d\n\nPast Syrian peace talks have run aground on the question of Assad\u2019s future and whether he is to continue as president, with the opposition insisting his departure is a precondition for any reforms.\n\nAssad said the matter could only be resolved through a constitutional referendum.\n\n\u201cIf they want to discuss this point, they need to discuss the constitution. You need a referendum for every (constitutional amendment). This is one of the points that could be discussed in the meeting\u201d in Kazakhstan, he said.\n\nThe talks are scheduled to begin in the Kazakh capital of Astana on Jan. 23. They follow a lengthy rapprochement between Russia, a key backer of Assad, and Turkey, a main sponsor of the opposition, that culminated in the cease-fire agreement that came into force on Dec. 30, but which has already started to erode.\n\nRussian officials have suggested the U.S. could be invited to the talks at a later date.\n\nThe Obama administration has been at odds with Russia over how to resolve Syria\u2019s conflict. Incoming President Donald Trump has indicated he might distance the U.S. from Syria\u2019s rebels, bringing Washington in closer alignment with Moscow.\n\nTrump wrote on Twitter Saturday that he would strive to build good relations with Russia, and \u201cperhaps, work together to solve many of the great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!\u201d\n\nAsked about the comments, Assad said warmer relations between Washington and Moscow \u201creflects positively on the Syrian conflict.\u201d\n\nAs for Aleppo, Assad said the government forces were forced \u201cto liberate\u201d the city.\n\n\u201cThere is a price, sometimes, but at the end the people are liberated from the terrorists,\u201d he said.\n\nOnce Syria\u2019s largest city and industrial hub, Aleppo has been devastated by nearly six years of war. Rebels took control of its eastern districts in 2012, before surrendering it to government authority last month.\n\nThe U.N. said the government\u2019s relentless military campaign, which displaced tens of thousands of civilians, could have violated the laws of war.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.8224413394927996, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 739, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.59688306492, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170109150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.0595399188092, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/remembering-pearl-harbor-75-years-later/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [705, 3288, 3771, 3991, 4456, 6350, 6627, 6629, 6631, 6633]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1051, "scraper_regex": 1190}}, "headline": "Remembering Pearl Harbor, 75 years later", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1190, "date": "20161204150000", "story_content": "The Japanese attack on December 7th,1941, sparked the defiant battle cry: \u201cREMEMBER PEARL HARBOR.\u201d And even 75 years later, the dwindling ranks of those who watched the attack happen remember it still. Our Cover Story is reported by Lee Cowan:\n\nHawaii\u2019s Pearl Harbor: It was just a place before it became a memorial \u2026 a tropically tranquil place that was Dorinda Nicholson\u2019s childhood home.\n\nDorinda was just six years old that Sunday in 1941. Born in Hawaii -- her family was civilian -- she lived near the dock for the famous Pan Am Clippers. The idea of war coming to this remote Pacific outpost seemed to most here about as likely as a white Hawaiian Christmas.\u00a0\n\nBut at 7:55 a.m. on December 7th, a storm did indeed come.\n\n\u201cThey were coming right over the house,\u201d she said of the planes. \u201cRight overhead, canopies pushed back, and you could see the pilot\u2019s faces, they were that close.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did you think when you saw that?\u201d Cowan asked. \n\n\u201cI just leaned closer to my dad and hugged him a little closer,\u201d Nicholson sighed. \n\nSix Japanese aircraft carriers had sailed to within 300 miles of the Hawaiian Islands, loaded with fighters, torpedo planes and bombers. They were on Oahu in minutes, like a swarm of angry mosquitoes.\n\nNicholson\u2019s view of the harbor was of \u201cnothing but oily, black smoke,\u201d she said. \u201cJust billowing, miles and miles and miles high.\u201d\n\nDorinda\u2019s family fled to the relative safety of the island\u2019s sugarcane fields, but Navy Seaman Dick Girocco had nowhere to go. He high-tailed it to a nearby ditch for cover.\n\nHe had joined the Navy at age 19, and was part of the crew that manned the PBY Catalina \u201cflying boats\u201d out of the naval air station at Ford Island.\n\nHe told Cowan the bombs were falling with 100 yards of his position. \u201cWhen I first went in it, I was laying at the bottom of it. And another fella come in jumping on top of me, laid right on top of me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he was saying Hail Marys as fast as he could say \u2018em, and I says, \u2018Well, that takes care of that part, I don\u2019t have to do that!\u2019\u201d\n\nBut then, a Japanese pilot spotted him. \n\n\u201cThis fella says, \u2018Well, you mind as well turn over and watch this,\u2019\u201d Girocco recalled. \u201cDumb me, I turn over, and I\u2019m looking up at a dive bomber coming down.\u201d\n\n\u201cStraight at you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. Banked out over the airfield and looked right down in the ditch, and I could look him right in the eye.\u201d\n\nHangar 79, just one down from where Girocco was, still bears the scars -- the bullet holes in its bright blue window panes remain, reminders of the serenity shattered on a quiet Sunday morning.\n\nCowan asked, \u201cWere you mad? Were you angry? Confused?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really recall whether I was angry or not,\u201d Girocco said. \u201cA lot of people ask me if I was scared. And I\u2019m sure I was. If I wasn\u2019t, something\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d\n\nAt the Army Air Corps\u2019 Hickam Airfield nearby, the Japanese assault continued. Parked wingtip-to-wingtip, nearly every American warbird was incinerated before ever taking flight.\n\nBut Japan\u2019s real target was \u201cBattleship Row.\u201d Within minutes, the California was sinking, and the Oklahoma had capsized, trapping hundreds in her hull.\n\nNinety-five-year-old Delton \u201cWally\u201d Walling was perched high in a patrol tower that day, and saw it all unfold.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe whole side of Battleship Row, clear down to the Arizona, is covered with flames, and people in the water swimming, trying to get out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a terrible, terrible scene.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine how I\u2019m feeling now, when I\u2019m watching my great Navy get stuffed down my throat? I\u2019m devastated. Man!\u201d\n\nIt got worse.  Not far away, the destroyer Shaw exploded with such ferocity, it sent pieces flying a half-mile away. \u201cThat almost knocked us off of the tower,\u201d Walling said.\u00a0\n\nBut it was the Arizona that got the worst of it. Hit by armor-piercing bombs, it, too, exploded, killing 1,177 -- the single largest loss of life in American naval history. Her hull is still in the mud where she sank.\u00a0\n\nThe Arizona remains the final resting place for most of her crew, including 23 sets of brothers -- family who died shoulder-to-shoulder, fighting a war that hadn\u2019t even been declared yet.\n\n\u201cWhen we talked to people, they will say, \u2018Oh, my father or my grandfather wouldn\u2019t tell us anything until he was 60 or 70 years old,\u2019\u201d said New York Times best-selling author Craig Nelson. \u201cThey were told to forget about it, to just get on with their lives and forget it.\u201d\u00a0\n\nNelson has spent the last five years compiling one of the most recent accounts of Pearl Harbor: \u201cPearl Harbor: From Infamy to Greatness\u201d (Simon & Schuster).\n\nDecember 7th, 1941, he says, was arguably just as pivotal to our identity as the 4th of July, 1776.\n\n\u201cIt completely transformed the United States,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAt that moment we were the 14th military power in the world, behind Sweden.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it served really as a rallying cry in a way?\u201d Cowan said.\n\n\u201cIt made us put on our big-boy pants and grow up and become a global leader.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. did bounce back, in double time. All but three of the ships damaged or sunk on December 7 were raised, repaired, and sailed again.\n\nIn fact, by the end of the war, the U.S. had chased down and destroyed every Japanese aircraft carrier used to launch the attack.\n\n\u201cThis is the greatest generation in the world, and we\u2019re down to a handful left,\u201d said Walling. \n\nLike most of the other 40,000 or so enlisted men on Oahu that day, he was a just teenager back then. But history\u2019s clock is relentless. \n\n\u201cI see their faces right before me, and know they\u2019re gone,\u201d said Pearl Harbor\u2019s chief historian, Daniel Martinez, who has worked here for 32 years. And with each passing anniversary, he worries the collective memory of December 7th is fading.\n\n\u201cMost of the young people that come here don\u2019t have a clue what happened at this place,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know who won the war. How will we remember World War II after they\u2019re gone?\u201d\n\nDorinda Nicholson now lives in Kansas City, Missouri, but she has made the nearly 5,000-mile trip to Oahu for almost every Pearl Harbor anniversary, to tell her story -- sometimes carrying the tiny gas mask that she and her brother wore as children in the days after the attack.\n\nWhy did she keep it all these years? \u201cOh, it\u2019s my history,\u201d she said. \n\nIt was history that changed her life, and ours. \u00a0The cry \u201cRemember Pearl Harbor\u201d sounds pretty obvious, but the challenge for the next generation is to really remember, absent those who will no longer be able to remind us face-to-face.\n\n\u201cThey are my heroes,\u201d said Walling. \u201cAnd I will tell their stories as long as I live.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For more info: ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.99666953086853, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1051, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 13, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.00578178107, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161204150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.33016175071361, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/avoid-these-digital-safety-pitfalls-while-traveling-over-holidays/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [559, 1058, 1372, 1465, 1718, 2025, 2314, 2618, 2924, 3459, 3758, 3773]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 592, "scraper_regex": 631}}, "headline": "Avoid these digital-safety pitfalls while traveling over holidays", "wordcount_as_scraped": 631, "date": "20161222110000", "story_content": "Traveling over the holidays can be stressful, but it can be even worse if you end up getting hacked, lose your travel information or forget your smartphone in the airport lounge.\n\nMore than 103 million Americans are projected to travel this holiday season, the most ever, according to AAA. It also puts consumers at more risk for digital snafus, since leaving the safety of one\u2019s password-protected home Wi-Fi can lead to problematic behaviors, like joining an airport\u2019s unsecured Wi-Fi system.\u00a0\n\nPlanning for a holiday trip should include taking steps to minimize the chances of getting hacked or hitting another digital pitfall while you\u2019re away from home, said Michael Kaiser, the executive director of the National CyberSecurity Alliance. While corporate hacks have gained the public\u2019s attention, hackers are increasingly going after consumers, with everything from phishing scams -- when scammers pretend to be a trusted company such as a bank -- to using public wifi to gain credentials.\u00a0\n\n\u201cReally think about what you have do before you go, such as adding lock downs on your devices,\u201d Kaiser said. \u201cKeep your eyes open and be alert and aware about the kinds of risks you might encounter. If people do that and are smart about basic security precautions,\u201d they will lower their risk of getting hacked.\u00a0\n\nBelow are 5 tips from the National CyberSecurity Alliance on keeping safe while traveling.\u00a0\n\nNever use public Wi-Fi. Free Wi-Fi hotspots are tempting to consumers who are trying to save on their data plans, but it\u2019s not worth the risk. Hackers can gain \u201cunfettered access to unsecured devices on the same network,\u201d according to Kaspersky Labs.\u00a0\n\nInstead, pay for a virtual private network such as Private Internet Access, which will create a secure Internet connection for your smartphone and other devices. They typically only cost a few dollars to gain access to a VPN for a month. For instance, Private Internet Access charges $6.95 for one month.\u00a0\n\nWhen connecting your laptop to the internet, rely on your smartphone\u2019s hotspot, rather than logging into an unsecured Wi-Fi connection. If data overages are a concern, you should contact your mobile phone carrier to ask about buying extra data to cover your data needs while you travel.\u00a0\n\nClean your computer and devices before you leave. Kaiser recommends getting rid of unwanted apps and programs from your devices, as well as updating all software before leaving home. That\u2019s because you\u2019ll want to make sure your operating systems and other programs have dowloaded any security updates.\u00a0\n\nAdd password protection. Make sure your smartphone, computer and other devices are secured with a password or biometrics, such as Apple\u2019s fingerprint swipe. If you lose your iPhone and don\u2019t have that protection, a hacker or thief could gain instant access to your email and other sensitive information.\u00a0\n\nTake care with Bluetooth. Bluetooth sends information between devices, which can put consumers at risk. For instance, some travelers may pair up their smartphones with their rental cars, not realizing that they may have downloaded their contacts into the car\u2019s system. If you do connect to your rental car, make sure you\u2019ve deleted your profile from the vehicle before turning it back to the rental company. Likewise, turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when you aren\u2019t using them, as the NCSA says they continue to track your whereabouts.\u00a0\n\nSign up for multi-factor authentication. Before leaving on your trip, make sure your email and other accounts you want to keep private have multi-factor, or two-step, authentication. This adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts. The most common type is adding your mobile phone number.\u00a0\n\nSaid Kaiser:\u00a0 \u201cYour email account is the crown jewel account. If it\u2019s compromised, [hackers] can go to other accounts and reset those accounts.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.382488489151, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 592, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.83134754589, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.36486486486486, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-dan-coats-intelligence-chief/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 528, "scraper_regex": 559}}, "headline": "Donald Trump names former Sen.

He served one term and did not seek re-election last year.\n\nCoats was a vocal critic of Russia and pushed the Obama administration to harshly punish Moscow for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. When the White House levied sanctions, the Kremlin responded by banning several lawmakers, including Coats, from traveling to Russia.\n\nMr. Trump received a briefing Friday from intelligence officials on the classified report about Russian interference in the 2016 election, and he later told The Associated Press that he \u201clearned a lot\u201d from the discussions.

The U.S. Coast Guard said it has received dozens of calls reporting Hudson sightings since last Wednesday. The Hudson originates upstate in the Adirondack Mountains and flows down through the Hudson Valley, continues between New York City and Jersey City, New Jersey, and empties into the Atlantic Ocean.\u00a0\n\nPetty Officer Steve Stromeir said the whale doesn\u2019t appear to be hurt and is just swimming around the island, CBS New York reported.\n\n\u201cThe Coast Guard has put out a safety broadcast, just a notice to mariners to proceed with caution in the area of Liberty Island and just keep a look out and call in with further reporters if the whale has been sighted again or has moved,\u201d Stromeir said.\n\nWhale experts say they\u2019ve seen increased numbers of mostly humpback whales in the New York area in recent years but it\u2019s rare to have one travel up the Hudson, with this one spotted about 20 miles north approaching suburban Westchester County. Although most experts agree water conditions have improved in the river in the 35 years since the passage of the Clean Water Act, they weren\u2019t willing to say that the visit from the humpback had a direct correlation. Dennis Suszkowski, science director of the Hudson River Foundation, and Howard Rosenbaum, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society\u2019s Ocean Giants program, said it appears the humpback may merely have been chasing after Menhaden, or bunker fish, that swam up the Hudson. \u201cOftentimes in the past when we have seen these animals in and around these waters we become concerned that they are sick or injured because they are not typically found here,\u201d Rosenbaum said. \u201cSo far with the images we have seen we don\u2019t have reason to believe that.\u201d\u00a0\n\nPaul Sieswerda, president of a group called Gotham Whale, said the efforts to clean the Hudson have improved conditions but added, \u201cwhat those conditions are precisely is difficult to say.\u201d He suggested that legislation that reduced fishing limits for Menhaden make them more prevalent and therefore available to the humpbacks to hunt.\u00a0\n\nSome took to social media to share video of the whale in the Hudson.\n\n    There she blows.  #hudsonriverwhale A video posted by Daniel Gallagher (@dgallagher105) on Nov 17, 2016 at 6:39am PST\n\n    Fudgey A video posted by Daniel Gallagher (@dgallagher105) on Nov 17, 2016 at 6:58am PST\n\nScientists have been accelerating their study of whales in the region in recent years. Last summer, the Wildlife Conservation Society, in collaboration with the New York Aquarium, teamed with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts to deploy a high-tech buoy 22 miles off the coast of Fire Island to monitor several species of great whales. In the past month, the buoy has detected three North Atlantic right whales, one of the world\u2019s highly endangered whale species. Sieswerda, a retired curator of the New England and New York aquariums, leads whale watching expeditions off the coasts of New York and New Jersey and said the number of whale sightings has soared since 2011.

The clashes between drug gangs were complicated by the fact that townspeople fed up with the violence had formed \u201ccommunity police\u201d vigilante squads in many places. The squads often prevent police and soldiers from moving freely and sometimes act on behalf of the gangs. \n\nGov. Hector Astudillo announced that federal authorities would return to patrol areas where dozens of often-dismembered bodies have been dumped on roadsides in recent weeks. The state has been riven, not just by the killings, but by the kidnapping of about a dozen people in the town of Ajuchitlan. Residents there announced they would create a vigilante force to look for the kidnap victims, an idea that threatened to create yet another armed group. The Ajuchitlan residents were apparently kidnapped last week by a fugitive gang leader known as \u201cEl Tequilero,\u201d who was believed to be wounded and hiding out with his kidnap victims in the mountains. The state attorney general headed up a massive manhunt using helicopters and ground troops to look for him. But Astudillo warned that the vigilantes would have to withdraw to allow police and soldiers to do their jobs. \u201cThe army, the state police, they can\u2019t be there with armed groups,\u201d Astudillo said. \u201cWithdraw, and we will enter immediately. But for the two to be there at the same time, that is not possible.\u201d The governor also announced the creation of mixed army-police patrols in parts of the state torn apart by cartel turf battles. One such area is the municipality of Zitlala, where a drug gang had set up a rural camp where it held kidnap victims and disposed of bodies. When one of the joint military-police patrols happened upon the camp earlier this week, it found a kidnapped man and what appeared to be clandestine burial pits. Investigators initially reported finding a dozen bodies. After days of digging, they discovered 32 bodies in 17 pits. The camp is near the area where nine decapitated bodies were found dumped on a roadside last week. The nine heads found in coolers at the camp may belong to those bodies, investigators said. The bodies and heads were taken to forensic labs in a bid to identify them. The area has been the scene of turf battles between two rival drug gangs - the Rojos and the Ardillos - who engage in extortion, kidnappings and killings. That rivalry has resulted in hundreds of deaths and disappearances in recent years. But in recent weeks the violence has spread to other areas, apparently as a result of turf battles between two or three other gangs, including the La Familia and the Tequileros gangs. Astudillo condemned what he has called the wave of \u201cbarbarism and savagery,\u201d and his office called the situation \u201ca public disturbance caused by organized crime.\u201d Soldiers were combing the area to see if there are any more graves. Investigators were working to identify the bodies and the killers, said Roberto Alvarez Heredia, spokesman for the Guerrero Coordinatinge Guerrero Coordinating Group. And in Tierra Colorada, nearer to the resort of Acapulco, rival vigilante groups have been engaged in a series of battles for control of the town, leading to fears the \u201ccommunity police\u201d may be taking sides in the gang wars. \u201cThe truth is, they are not really community forces, nor are they police,\u201d Astudillo said. \u201cThey are armed groups that unfortunately carry out acts ... that generate more violence and confrontation, rather than help.\u201d The largely rural, impoverished state had 1,832 reported homicides in the first 10 months of 2016.

Ryan Zinke says he would never sell, give away or transfer public lands, a crucial stance in his home state of Montana and the West where access to hunting and fishing is considered sacrosanct.\n\nZinke feels so strongly that he resigned as a delegate to the Republican National Convention last summer because of the GOP\u2019s position in favor of land transfers to state or private groups. But Zinke\u2019s commitment to public lands has come into question in recent weeks and is likely to be a point of contention Tuesday as the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee considers his nomination to be interior secretary under President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nZinke, 55, a former Navy SEAL who just won his second term in Congress, was an early Trump supporter and, like his prospective boss, has expressed skepticism about the urgency of climate change.\n\nA self-described \u201cTeddy Roosevelt Republican,\u201d Zinke has supported legislation to boost land and water conservation and recreation on public lands. Zinke has also advocated for increased oil and gas drilling and coal-mining on Western lands.\n\nThe Interior Department and other U.S. agencies control almost a third of land in the West and even more of the underground \u201cmineral estate\u201d that holds vast amounts of coal, oil and natural gas.\n\nZinke\u2019s position on public lands came under fire after he voted in favor of a measure from House Republicans that would allow federal land transfers to be considered cost-free and budget-neutral, making it easier for drilling and development.\n\nZinke \u201csays he\u2019s against transfer of federal lands, but there\u2019s a big gap between what he says and what he does in that regard,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, the nation\u2019s oldest and largest environmental group.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think the congressman would be on his best behavior going into a job interview, but instead he\u2019s taking steps to once again jeopardize the future of Montana\u2019s outdoor economy,\u201d Nancy Keenan, executive director of the Montana Democratic Party, said after the Jan. 3 vote.\n\nZinke\u2019s spokeswoman said the congressman maintains his position against the sale or transfer of federal lands.\n\nSupporters calls the dispute overblown and say Zinke\u2019s vote was on a much larger package that sets House rules in the new Congress.\n\nIndeed, his support for public lands was a crucial reason why Zinke was chosen by Trump. The president-elect and his son, Donald Trump Jr., both oppose sale of federal lands. The younger Trump, an avid hunter, has taken a keen interest in Interior issues and played a key role in Zinke\u2019s selection.\n\nCoal is likely to be another focus on Tuesday. Montana boasts the largest coal reserves in the nation, and Zinke has warned environmentalists and the Obama administration that to take coal out of the energy mix would be \u201ca disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with keeping it in the ground,\u201d he said during his re-election campaign.\n\nEric Washburn, a lobbyist and former aide to Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, said Zinke will likely be asked to \u201cdefend federal ownership over federal lands\u201d and detail how he would balance energy development with the need to conserve fish and wildlife habitats.\n\nZinke \u201cappears to be a straight shooter, someone that energy and conservation interests can both work with,\u201d Washburn said.\n\nThe Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership endorsed Zinke, calling him \u201ca leader on many issues important to America\u2019s hunters and anglers.\u201d\n\nBrune, of the Sierra Club, scoffed at the comparison to Roosevelt, saying the only way to connect the men is \u201cto describe the ways Zinke wants to undo TR\u2019s legacy\u201d of conservation.\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, the top Democrat on the energy panel, said she is eager to ask Zinke about modernizing the federal coal program \u201cto make sure American taxpayers aren\u2019t short-changed for the benefit of corporate interests.\u201d Cantwell also said wants reassurances that Zinke will protect the interests of American consumers and native tribes - \u201cnot just the coal and mining companies.\u201d\n\nZinke spent 23 years as a Navy SEAL, serving in Kosovo and Iraq, where he was awarded two Bronze Stars for combat missions. He currently serves on the House Natural Resources and Armed Services committees.\n\nHe made an unsuccessful 2012 run for Montana lieutenant governor before shifting his ambitions to Congress in 2014.

A lawsuit challenging the voter ID law is pending, with trial set for next year. The plaintiffs have argued the law disenfranchises voters who are unable to obtain a state-issued ID. Last year, 31 state driver\u2019s license offices \u2014 many in poor, minority communities \u2014 were closed because of budget concerns. Most were open one day a week and now they are open one to two days a month, with critics complaining the reduced hours remain a barrier.\n\nARIZONA\n\nLong lines led to frustration during Arizona\u2019s March primary, when some voters in the Phoenix area waited hours to cast ballots after county election officials opened 60 polling stations \u2014 fewer than half what is typical. On Tuesday, Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, plans on having more than 700 sites. Meanwhile, state Democrats filed a lawsuit alleging some Republicans are planning to intimidate voters at the polls. Arizona also was one of two states in which hackers over the summer attempted to breach voter registration systems.\n\nFLORIDA\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential election, Florida had the longest average wait time among all states \u2014 45 minutes, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. Some of the most populous counties have since expanded early voting hours in the hopes of reducing long lines on Election Day.\n\nMeanwhile, legal battles continue over voter registration. After Hurricane Matthew raked Florida\u2019s eastern coastline, Democrats sued to extend the deadline for voters to register. After a court order, about 107,000 people registered during the extension, but there was a concern that not all those applications would be processed before early voting began. A federal judge declined a request by Democrats to force election officials to allow those affected to vote even if their registration had yet to be verified, saying those affected could cast a provisional ballot that may be counted once their eligibility is confirmed.\n\nGEORGIA\n\nThe state\u2019s process for handling voter registrations and maintaining its voter lists has been the subject of lawsuits this year. One pending lawsuit was filed against Secretary of State Brian Kemp over a policy allowing for people to be removed from state voter rolls for failing to vote in recent elections. Lawyers in the Georgia case said roughly 372,000 voters were purged between 2012 and 2014.\n\nCivil rights groups also sued Kemp\u2019s office over a policy they said had prevented tens of thousands of residents from registering to vote and violated the federal Voting Rights Act. The policy rejected applicants whose identifying information did not exactly match state or federal databases. Kemp\u2019s office informed the court in September that it had changed the policy. Meanwhile, long lines have been reported in some places since early voting began Oct. 17, including a four-hour wait in one metro Atlanta county on the first day.\n\nINDIANA\n\nIndiana State Police have said they are investigating some voter registration applications submitted by Patriot Majority USA, a Washington, D.C.-based voter mobilization group with ties to the Democratic Party. The probe is examining whether some applications contained forged signatures or other possible elements of fraud. Attorneys for Patriot Majority have asked Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights division to look into whether the investigation is an attempt to suppress the votes of black residents. The group has run voter registration drives in 11 states in previous years.\n\nSeparately, Secretary of State Connie Lawson, a Republican, warned recently of widespread voter registration fraud after her office found a heavier than usual number of changes to voter registration records. She later tempered those remarks to say that many of the thousands of changes simply could be residents rushing to correct their names or birth dates online ahead of the election.\n\nKANSAS\n\nA Kansas court fight focused on whether a group of as many as 50,000 residents could vote because they did not submit citizenship documents, as required under state law, when registering at motor vehicle offices or with a federal form. Federal courts had previously ordered the state to count their votes in federal elections. The secretary of state\u2019s office had sought to toss out their votes in state and local races, something a state judge has since blocked.\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe state\u2019s 2016 primary was marred by widespread reports of people in Brooklyn saying they were unable to vote. This happened after about 126,000 Brooklyn voters were removed from voter registration lists or deemed inactive between November 2015 and April of this year. Just days before the presidential election, a lawsuit was filed claiming the New York City Board of Elections had improperly removed voters from the rolls.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA\n\nIn 2013, Republican lawmakers in North Carolina passed a package of measures that required voters to show photo ID, reduced early voting and eliminated same-day registration during the early voting period. In July, a federal appeals court struck down several parts of the law, saying they \u201ctarget African Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d Republican officials have said discrimination was not their intent. A divided U.S. Supreme Court declined in August to take up the case.\n\nAfter the ruling, Democrats raised alarm when the executive director of the state Republican Party emailed GOP activists suggesting each county election board\u2019s Republicans work to limit early voting hours, curtail Sunday voting and avoid placing voting sites on college campuses. This set up a battle over early voting plans in a third of the state\u2019s counties.\n\nThe dispute ultimately was resolved by the state Board of Elections, which restored Sunday voting in a few counties where local officials had sought to eliminate it and expanded hours in counties where the proposals seemed too limiting. But civil rights groups remained concerned that reductions in some places along with confusion over the photo ID law could affect turnout among black voters.\n\nA week before Tuesday\u2019s election, the state chapter of the NAACP filed a lawsuit alleging thousands of people, many of them black, had been removed improperly from voter rolls after being challenged by private citizens.\n\nOHIO\n\nA federal judge ruled in October that voters who were wrongfully removed from Ohio\u2019s registration lists can cast ballots in Tuesday\u2019s election. The number of voters covered by the ruling is not known, although some have estimated it to be in the tens of thousands. That decision follows an earlier ruling that found Ohio\u2019s process for maintaining its voter rolls wrongfully removes eligible people based on their failure to vote in recent elections.\n\nAfter state Democrats filed a lawsuit alleging GOP plans to intimidate voters, a judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump campaign and a Republican political operative aimed at preventing harassment at the polls. A separate effort by Democrats in Ohio to restore \u201cgolden week,\u201d when people could register and cast ballots at the same time, failed after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene.\n\nDemocrats had claimed the reduction, along with other voting changes, disproportionately burdened black voters and those who lean Democratic. But the state\u2019s attorneys argued the reduction alleviates administrative burdens for local election officials while reducing costs and the potential for fraud.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nTrump has warned for weeks of a \u201crigged\u201d election, asking supporters to head to the polls to watch for voter fraud and mentions Philadelphia as a place that could have problems on Election Day.\n\nDays before Tuesday\u2019s election, state Democrats filed a lawsuit alleging some Republicans were planning to intimidate voters at the polls. Meanwhile, a judge rejected a lawsuit by Republicans challenging a state law that requires poll watchers to be registered in the county where they want to monitor the vote.\n\nTEXAS\n\nA federal appeals court ruled this summer that the state\u2019s 2011 voter ID law discriminated against minorities and the poor, ordering officials to relax the ID requirements for the November election. Experts had said the law was among the toughest in the nation, requiring voters to show one of seven acceptable forms of photo identification that included a concealed handgun license but not a college student ID.\n\nIt was estimated that more than 600,000 registered voters in Texas lacked an acceptable ID under the law. And there were early signs that confusion surrounding the law has persisted, with reports during early voting of at least seven counties with outdated posters and poll workers saying photo IDs were required to vote.\n\nA federal judge in September had said Texas officials must change its voter outreach efforts after the Justice Department accused the state of still giving the impression that some voters cannot cast a ballot.\n\nWISCONSIN\n\nThis is the first presidential election in Wisconsin in which voters will be asked for photo identification. The voter ID law was initially blocked by the courts, and then went into effect for the presidential primary in April. In July, a federal judge left the voter ID requirement in place but struck down more than a dozen other election changes, including limits on early voting hours and locations.\n\nAs many as 300,000 Wisconsin voters may not have the required photo ID. In recent weeks, recordings by voter advocacy groups have shown state DMV workers giving people inaccurate information about what they can do to obtain alternative voting credentials if they lack a photo ID. A federal judge in October ordered the state to clarify the process and produce a simple, one-page handout that can be distributed in person and online.\n\nOTHER STATES\n\nCivil rights groups are also monitoring a group of other states with new voting restrictions or requirements in place for the first time.

He said China\u2019s building of man-made islands in disputed waters in the South China Sea was a sign of its disrespect for America, and vowed to bulk up the U.S. military.\n\nDespite that, Chinese state media and government-backed scholars largely favored Trump over his Democratic Party rival Hillary Clinton.

Beijing has closely aligned its foreign policy with Russia, putting it at odds with the U.S. over issues including the civil war in Syria and the deployment of U.S. anti-missile defenses in South Korea.\n\nAside from his criticisms of Beijing, Trump has touted his business dealings with Chinese companies, although he is not known at present to have any major investments in the country.\n\nTrump\u2019s espousal of a more isolationist foreign policy could also benefit China by weakening U.S. support for longtime Asian allies such as South Korea, Taiwan and Japan.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.6600660085678101, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 558, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.67628081042, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114170000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 2, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 3.76344086021505, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amid-starvation-conditions-syrian-rebels-losing-aleppo-battle/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [588, 3554]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 592, "scraper_regex": 631}}, "headline": "Amid starvation conditions, Syrian rebels losing Aleppo battle", "wordcount_as_scraped": 631, "date": "20161113160000", "story_content": "BEIRUT - Syrian government forces regained control Saturday of areas they lost over the past two weeks to a rebel offensive on the edge of the northern city of Aleppo, ending a major attempt by insurgents to break the siege on eastern parts of the city, an activist group and pro-government media said.\n\nThe insurgents had seized a couple of strategic areas in western Aleppo after launching an offensive on Oct. 28 in an attempt to break the siege imposed in July on rebel-held eastern Aleppo, which has also been targeted by\u00a0waves of Syrian and Russian airstrikes.\n\nRussia said last month that it would halt the airstrikes on the city and urged insurgents to leave. But the fighters, including members of the al Qaeda-linked Fatah al-Sham Front, refused to leave after the government opened corridors for them to cross to the nearby province of Idlib, an insurgent stronghold.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Saturday that government forces and their allies have regained control of Al-Assad and Minyan districts, west of Aleppo.\n\n\u201cThe epic battle for Aleppo has failed,\u201d said the Observatory\u2019s chief Rami Abdurrahman, using the term that the insurgents had assigned to the offensive.\n\nSyrian state media reported that the two districts have been retaken.

The network is run by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is fighting alongside Assad\u2019s forces.\n\nThe Observatory said the fighting left 508 dead, including civilians and fighters from both sides. It said the dead insurgents included 90 foreign fighters while on the government side, 83 troops, 28 Hezbollah gunmen and 41 other fighters from Iran and Iraq were killed as well.\n\nOn Thursday, Jan Egeland, the special adviser to the U.N. envoy for Syria, said the last food rations in besieged eastern Aleppo will run out by next week. Speaking in Geneva, Egeland said the last time the more than 250,000 people inside east Aleppo received any humanitarian aid was in the beginning of July.

Attacks on Chicago Police Department officers nearly doubled last year, which also reflects nationwide trends, the department said.\n\nOfficers made 10 percent more gun arrests in 2016 than in 2015, and they recovered 8,300 guns -- a 20 percent increase from the year prior, the Chicago Police Department said.\n\nPfleger said he hopes Saturday\u2019s visual will put others into action to prevent violence in 2017.  \u201cThe last day of the year we will remember all of who\u2019ve been shot and killed in 2016 (and prior),\u201d Pfleger said in a statement. \u201cWe want to break the cycle of violence for 2017!\u201d \u00a0\n\nBefore the march, Kelly Fitzgerald Clark found a cross with the name of her late husband.

In an interview with The Washington Post through the D.C. jail\u2019s video visitation system, the 27-year-old man recounted his experience in the D.C. Superior Court cell. Court papers say security cameras captured part of the 12-minute attack. The Associated Press generally doesn\u2019t identify victims of sexual attacks. \u201cThis happened in what is supposed to be one of the safest places. In the courthouse. Where marshals are supposed to protect everyone. Just steps away from a judge,\u201d the inmate said. \u201cYou would think you would be safer there.\u201d The man said he heard one marshal say, \u201cIt\u2019s lunchtime,\u201d shortly before the three left and he didn\u2019t see or hear any other marshals. Officials from the U.S. Marshals Service and the court declined to comment on what happened on Veterans Day as the inmates waited to be taken back to the D.C. jail. The Marshals Service also would not discuss the staffing at the time, or how often marshals are required to check on inmates. The inmate, who is accused of attacking a man with a box cutter at a liquor store, was at court that day for a judge-ordered psychological evaluation following his arrest last month. After a hearing, he was ushered into a holding cell. Jerome Holliway, 36, who had been arrested for violating his parole in a previous simple assault and obstruction of justice case, was already in the cell, according to court records. Holliway asked the younger inmate several times why he was arrested, but he ignored the questions. After Holliway told him \u201cI need to make sure you\u2019re not a cop,\u201d the younger inmate said Holliway threw him to the floor, then dragged him across the floor by the shackles around his ankles to a small area behind a metal divider where the toilet is located. Holliway choked, punched and bit him and then sexually assaulted him. \u201cHe almost killed me. I thought I was going to die. I tried to fight back,\u201d the man said. \u201cI tried to scream for help. I was panicked,\u201d he said. He said his assailant repeatedly told him to \u201cshut up.\u201d When marshals arrived five minutes after the attack ended they found the naked inmate curled into a fetal position with his orange jumpsuit around his ankles, according to court documents. Holliway, fully clothed, was sitting on a bench. Holliway told authorities the sex was consensual, according to the documents. The younger inmate fell unconscious during the attack and was hospitalized for two days, he said. The assault left him physically and emotionally scarred. \u201cI don\u2019t feel how I normally would. I\u2019m angry. But I\u2019m not sure if how I feel is because of the attack or because of the meds I\u2019m now on,\u201d he said. Holliway is charged with first-degree sexual abuse. A spokeswoman for the D.C. Public Defender Service, which represents Holliway, declined to comment. Last week, a D.C. Superior Court judge delayed a hearing in the younger inmate\u2019s assault case after a court psychologist found the man mentally incompetent to stand trial. Tammy Seltzer, director of the D.C. Jail and Prison Advocacy Project, called the alleged assault \u201chorrific.\u201d \u201cLeaving defendants unsupervised and cameras unmonitored puts individuals in danger.

It described him as a soldier of the group, and added the caption: \u201cBrother Abdul Razak Ali Artan, God accept him, implementer of the Ohio attack, a student in his third year in university.\u201d\n\nInvestigators have so far found no direct link between the terrorist organization and Artan. ISIS has previously taken claim for attacks that it had no planning nor part in.\n\nSources previously told CBS News that Artan put an angry message on Facebook before the attack, saying: \u201cAmerica! Stop interfering with other countries, especially the Muslim Ummah. We are not weak.\u201d\n\nWhat investigators are discovering is a dramatic escalation in his statements online. Hallmark signs, law enforcement officials say, of someone radicalized -- and turning to action.\n\nLaw enforcement sources said shortly before the attack, the suspect posted a message or messages on Facebook suggesting that he was disturbed by how Muslims were being treated, CBS News homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues reported. Artan reportedly posted: \u201cI am sick and tired of seeing my fellow Muslim brothers and sisters being killed and tortured EVERYWHERE.\u201dOfficials said Artan came to the U.S. with six family members in 2014 after fleeing Somalia and spending seven years in a refugee camp in Pakistan. CBS News has learned that Artan\u2019s father was abducted in Somalia in 2007 and that is why his family left the country to ultimately seek refugee status in 2012. The family came to the U.S. by flying into New York, then going through Dallas and on to Ohio where they settled.\n\nArtan first attended community college in Columbus where he graduated on the dean\u2019s list. Last August he became a student at Ohio State University where he was interviewed by the campus paper, The Lantern. He complained about what he believed was the media\u2019s negative portrayal of Muslims.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to pray in the open, but I was kind of scared with everything going on in the media...if people look at me, a Muslim praying, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to think, what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s the media that put that picture in their heads so they\u2019re just going to have it and it, it\u2019s going to make them feel uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nCBS News has learned that Artan was in the D.C. metropolitan area last week. FBI investigators are trying to piece together what he was doing there. Authorities said he visited a Home Depot style store while in the D.C. area.\u00a0\n\nHome Depot said that they couldn\u2019t share details about anything and didn\u2019t want to inadvertently interfere with the investigation.\n\nA law enforcement source told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milion that Artan was was at the Home Depot in D.C. but could not confirm that he purchased a knife at \u00a0the time. Investigators discovered he was in the D.C. area through bank records.\n\nThe source said that Artan dropped his sister off at high school and then went to Walmart in Columbus where he purchased the knife used in the attack.\n\nOne of Artan\u2019s victims, Iraq war veteran and OSU senior Anderson Payne told CBS News that he was trying to help car crash victims when he was slashed.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Payne told CBS News\u2019 Dean Reynolds. \u201cHe looked very angry he had just wrecked his car which is normal to be mad. But when he started swinging his knife, I knew it wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d\n\nA senior U.S. official told CBS News that while they believe that Artan was inspired by radical terrorists, they are still compiling a list of people he may have been contacting. It\u2019s unclear if federal officials have been able to access Artan\u2019s digital devices, but they do have a list of people he was possibly in contact with and are setting up interviews.\u00a0\n\nAlso Thursday, officials released 911 calls made during the attack. The 911 calls describe panic and confusion on the campus.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m on the Ohio State campus, I think there\u2019s been some type of terrorist attack uh\u2026\u201d a male voice says in one of the 911 calls. \u201cBecause a guy ran a car through a crowd of students!\u00a0 He did it purposely.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a man who drove a car through a group of people, he hit an OSU employee, he drove it in to a crowd of people, the car is now sitting in front of the building, the man got out of the car and took off running \u2013 I just need an ambulance here right now!\u201d another male can be heard saying on one of the calls.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.28834342956543, "HarmVice": 9, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 610, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.97928520513, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161130200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.9180327868852505, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/green-party-jill-stein-drops-pennsylvania-recount-bid/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [119, 1736, 2100, 2543, 3324, 5273]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 635, "scraper_regex": 837}}, "headline": "Green Party will switch to federal court for Penn. recount bid", "wordcount_as_scraped": 837, "date": "20161204040000", "story_content": "Last Updated Dec 4, 2016 12:52 AM EST\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa. --\u00a0A Green Party-backed campaign changed its strategy to force a statewide recount of Pennsylvania\u2019s Nov. 8 presidential election, won by Republican Donald Trump, and said late Saturday night that it will seek help in the federal courts, rather than the state courts.\n\nThe announcement that it would seek an emergency federal court order on Monday for a recount came hours after it dropped a case in the state courts. \u201cMake no mistake - the Stein campaign will continue to fight for a statewide recount in Pennsylvania,\u201d recount campaign lawyer Jonathan Abady said in a statement issued around 11:30 p.m. \u201cWe are committed to this fight to protect the civil and voting rights of all Americans.\u201d In the statement, Abady said barriers to a recount in Pennsylvania are pervasive and the state court system is ill-equipped to address the problem. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has framed the campaign as an effort to explore whether voting machines and systems had been hacked and the election result manipulated. Stein\u2019s lawyers, however, had offered no evidence of hacking in Pennsylvania\u2019s election, and the state Republican Party and Trump had asked the court to dismiss the state court case. \n\nThe decision came two days before a state court hearing was scheduled in the case. Saturday\u2019s court filing to withdraw the case said the Green Party-backed voters who filed it \u201care regular citizens of ordinary means\u201d and cannot afford the $1 million bond ordered by the court by 5 p.m. Monday. Green Party-backed efforts to force recounts and analyze election software in scattered precincts were continuing.\u00a0\n\nWhile changing the election result was always believed to be very unlikely (even by Hillary Clinton\u2019s own campaign), the only path to changing the outcome involved recounts in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan swinging to Clinton. Without a recountin Pennsylvania, the recounts in Michigan and Wisconsin will have no change on the end result of the election.\u00a0\n\nThe Pennsylvania GOP confirmed the recount had been dropped in a statement. In the statement, the Pennsylvania GOP charged that the recount effort \u201cclearly has no chance of changing the results and that it was done for media attention.\u201d\n\nStein said in a statement on Saturday night the cost of the recount had caused the Green Party to drop its court case. Stein also said in a statement that she will hold a rally at Trump Tower on Monday.\u00a0\n\nIn a series of tweets, Stein called it \u201codd\u201d that the recount effort had to \u201cjump through bureaucratic loops.\u201d\n\nHow odd is it that we must jump through bureaucratic hoops and raise millions of dollars so we can trust our election results? #Recount2016\u2014 Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) December 4, 2016\n\n#Recount2016 is so expensive because of elected leaders who have refused to invest in a 21st-century voting system.\u2014 Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) December 4, 2016\n\nA recount began Thursday in Wisconsin, while a recount could begin next week in Michigan. Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in Pennsylvania was particularly stunning: the state\u2019s fifth-most electoral votes are a key stepping stone to the White House, and no Republican presidential candidate had captured the state since 1988.\u00a0\n\nStein had said the purpose of Pennsylvania\u2019s recount was to ensure \u201cour votes are safe and secure,\u201d considering hackers\u2019 probing of election targets in other states and hackers\u2019 accessing of the emails of the Democratic National Committee and several Clinton staffers. U.S. security officials have said they believe Russian hackers orchestrated the email hacks, something Russia has denied. They have sought unsuccessfully in recent days to get various counties to allow a forensic examination of their election system software. Lawyers for Trump and the state Republican Party argued there was no evidence, or even an allegation, that tampering with Pennsylvania\u2019s voting systems had occurred. Further, Pennsylvania law does not allow a court-ordered recount, they argued, and a lawyer for the Green Party had acknowledged that the effort was without precedent in Pennsylvania. The case also had threatened Pennsylvania\u2019s ability to certify its presidential electors by the Dec. 13 federal deadline, Republican lawyers argued. On Saturday, a GOP lawyer, Lawrence Tabas, said the case had been meant \u201csolely for purposes to delay the Electoral College vote in Pennsylvania for President-Elect Trump.\u201d The state\u2019s top elections official, Secretary of State Pedro Cortes, a Democrat, has said there was no evidence of any sort of cyberattacks or irregularities in the election. Any recount would change few votes, Cortes predicted. As of Friday, Trump\u2019s margin of victory in Pennsylvania was 49,000, or less than 1 percent, out of 6 million votes cast, according to state election officials. Final counts were outstanding in some counties, including heavily populated Allegheny County, but state and county officials did not expect any outstanding uncounted votes to change the outcome of the presidential election in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania\u2019s automatic statewide recount trigger is 0.5 percent. Stein drew less than 1 percent of the votes cast.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.44927537441254, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 635, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.2856486930700002, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161204040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.25984251968504, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/from-trump-to-terrorism-the-year-in-polling/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [792, 1712, 1839, 2864, 3203, 3337, 5882, 6181, 6370, 7294, 8245, 9605]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1444, "scraper_regex": 1602}}, "headline": "From Trump to terrorism, the year in polls", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1602, "date": "20161230120000", "story_content": "An historic presidential campaign, the economy, race relations, and terrorism were some of the topics covered in CBS News Polls over the course of 2016. Here\u2019s a look at back at what was on the minds of Americans this year.\n\nThe 2016 Election: High Interest, but Low Opinions\n\nThe year began with voters across the country captivated by the 2016 campaign. In a January CBS News/New York Times poll, 70 percent of voters described the election campaign as interesting; a reversal from four years earlier when most Americans (55 percent) told a Pew Research Center Poll that the 2012 campaign was dull. \n\nRepublican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton started the year as their party\u2019s frontrunners and history was made when they became nominees:\u00a0 Clinton was the first woman nominee of a major party for president and Mr. Trump, now President-elect, was the first nominee without political or military experience. But Clinton and Trump were noteworthy for another reason \u2013 both were unpopular among the broader voting public. \n\nDespite their successes during the primaries, throughout the general election campaign voters nationwide consistently viewed Mr. Trump and Clinton negatively. These candidates scored the highest unfavorable ratings of any major party candidates in CBS News polling going back to 1984, when the poll began asking this question. \n\nOverall impressions of Clinton and Mr. Trump changed little over the course of the campaign with news events seemingly having little impact. In March of this year, 52 percent of registered voters nationwide held an unfavorable view of Clinton, and in the days before the election that figure was 54 percent. \u00a0\n\nSimilarly, Trump\u2019s unfavorable rating was 57 percent nationwide in March and stood at 56 percent heading into Election Day. \u00a0\n\nNot surprisingly, views of the candidates were influenced by partisanship. Clinton and Mr. Trump were viewed favorably by those in their own party (and unfavorably by the opposing party). Independents generally held negative views of both candidates. \n\nControversies and Characteristics\n\nThere was no shortage of scandals and controversies during the 2016 campaign and the CBS News Poll measured voters\u2019 reactions to these events. \n\nClinton\u2019s use of a private email address and server while Secretary of State dogged her campaign. Throughout 2016, most voters said Clinton did something wrong by setting up her email the way she did, including more than four in ten who thought what she did was illegal. These views changed little over the course of the campaign. \n\nAbout a month before Election Day, a decade-old video surfaced of Mr. Trump talking about making advances toward women. A CBS News poll conducted soon after the video\u2019s release found that more than eight in ten voters nationwide had heard or read about it.\u00a0 Forty percent of voters came away with a worse impression of Trump because of his comments, but it didn\u2019t sway many of his supporters. Most said it had no impact on their views of Mr. Trump. \n\nDuring the campaign, CBS News polling tested the candidates on some key attributes and characteristics. Clinton had an advantage on experience. \u00a0She was seen by a majority of voters as prepared and qualified to be president, but most did not think she was honest or trustworthy.\u00a0 \n\nThroughout 2016, the percentage who said Clinton was untrustworthy never dropped below 60 percent. As for Mr. Trump, his weaknesses were his temperament and that he wasn\u2019t prepared for the job of president. Mr. Trump\u2019s strength, however, was that he was seen as a straight talker. Voters were also more inclined to see Mr. Trump as someone who could bring change rather than Clinton. \n\nChange would trump experience for many voters. Bringing change was the top quality voters were looking for in a candidate according to CBS News exit polls, and Trump won those voters handily. \n\nCampaign 2016 \u2013 The Most Negative Ever?\n\nAs with many campaigns, opinions of the candidates and news events were viewed largely through a partisan lens, but partisans agreed on something about Campaign 2016 \u2013 it was one of the most negative they could remember. \n\nIn October, 82 percent of voters nationwide said this campaign was more negative than previous ones, a jump of 45 points from 2012 and the highest figure in the history of CBS News polls. Majorities of Republicans (79 percent), Democrats (76 percent) and independents (81 percent) described the 2016 race as more negative.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\n\nWhile a contest was being fought over who would become president in 2017, what about the person currently in the Oval Office? President Barack Obama started off his final full year in office with Americans divided about his job performance, but he ended on a high note. This month, a CBS News Poll found 56 percent of Americans approve of the job Mr. Obama was doing as president, a jump of 10 points since January and his highest approval rating in four years. \n\nCompared with recent two-term presidents at similar points in their presidencies, President Obama\u2019s approval rating is considerably higher than that of his immediate predecessor, George W. Bush (24 percent), but lower than both Bill Clinton\u2019s (67 percent) and Ronald Reagan\u2019s (63 percent). \n\nThe Economy\n\nThe public\u2019s views of the economy grew more positive over the course of the year. Since September, more than half of Americans described the national economy as very or fairly good. Fifty-five percent said the economy was in good shape in a CBS News December poll, up six points from January. \n\nAnd more than twice as many said the economy was getting better (36 percent) than getting worse (16 percent).\n\nRace Relations and the Police\n\nWhile Americans began feeling more positive about the economy this year, that was not the case with the state of race relations in the country.\u00a0 In July, negative views of race relations in the U.S. rose to a level not seen since the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the Rodney King verdict. Just 26 percent of Americans said race relations in the U.S. were good \u2013 an 11-point drop from a year before, while 69 percent said they were bad.\u00a0 \n\nDuring 2016, there were of a number of incidents involving the police and African American civilians and polling this year showed a deep divide in how blacks and whites view the police.\u00a0 \n\nIn a July CBS News Poll, 85 percent of white Americans said their local police make them feel safe -- but just 53 percent of black Americans agreed. Forty-five percent of black Americans said the police made them anxious. \n\nThat same poll found differences by race in how the police use deadly force. Three in four African Americans said police are more likely to use deadly force against a black person than a white person, but 56 percent of white Americans said race doesn\u2019t make a difference in the use of deadly force by police.\n\nTerrorism\n\nAmericans remained on alert in 2016 when it came to terrorism. Following the attack a year ago in San Bernardino where 14 died and others were injured, the public\u2019s concern about terrorism in the U.S. spiked. At that time, 44 percent said another terrorist attack in the U.S. was very likely, the highest percentage since right after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\u00a0 \n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting attack at a Orlando nightclub in June, Americans continued to be concerned about a terrorist attack but fears had ebbed a bit since San Bernardino. \n\nCBS News Polling in 2016 found that most Americans continue to see the Islamic militant group ISIS as a major threat to the country and they don\u2019t think the U.S. is doing a good job combatting that threat. In October, 59 percent of Americans said the fight against ISIS was going badly. Evaluations in the fall were more positive compared to the start of the year but still decidedly negative. \n\nA Look at Women and Hispanics in the U.S.\n\nIn 2016, CBS News conducted in-depth surveys of two important demographic groups: women and Hispanics. In September, CBS News and the New York Times interviewed 865 women across the country to ask about their lives and their expectations for the future. The survey found women generally optimistic but still facing obstacles.\u00a0\n\nSeventy-seven percent of women said their opportunities to succeed in life are better than their mothers, and looking ahead, 74 percent said girls\u2019 opportunities to succeed in life would be better than their own. \n\nBut, the poll found that 48 percent of women feel that there are more advantages in being a man in today\u2019s society than in being a woman. Only 6 percent said women had more advantages. \n\nIn October, the CBS News Poll explored how Americans view Hispanic culture in the U.S. and asked Hispanics themselves about their own lives. Fifty-one percent of Americans said the influence of Hispanics in the U.S. has been mostly good for the country; just 13 percent said it has been mostly bad. Hispanics themselves were especially optimistic about their opportunities in the U.S. Six in ten said their opportunities to succeed in life are better than those of their parents, compared to 41 percent of non-Hispanics who felt that way. \n\nLooking Ahead to 2017\n\nDonald Trump campaigned on change and according to a recent CBS News poll, 62 percent of Americans think he will bring real change to the way things are done in Washington. \n\nBut many feel uneasy. More than half (53 percent) of Americans are either concerned or scared about what Mr. Trump will do as President, while fewer \u2013 46 percent -- are excited or optimistic about a Trump presidency.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.07323229312897, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1444, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 9, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.24228263639, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161230120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.42382271468144, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/carnegie-deli-new-york-city-closes-pastrami-sandwiches/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [522, 707, 1476]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 745, "scraper_regex": 803}}, "headline": "\"It is delicious, we will miss it so much\": NYC's legendary Carnegie Deli says goodbye", "wordcount_as_scraped": 803, "date": "20161231050000", "story_content": "NEW YORK -- After 79 years of serving up heaps of cured meat to tourists, theater patrons and workaday New Yorkers, the Carnegie Delicatessen will slice its last ridiculously oversized sandwich on Friday. Fans lined up all week for a last bite at the restaurant, which got a star turn in Woody Allen\u2019s 1984 film \u201cBroadway Danny Rose\u201d and remained a stop until the end for out-of-towners looking for the classic New York deli experience.\u00a0\n\nMarian Harper-Levine, President of the Carnegie Deli and a second-generation owner, called the decision to close its 7th Avenue location \u201cincredibly difficult,\u201d CBS New York reports.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlong with my daughter Sarri and in honor of my late father Milton, I would like to sincerely thank all of our loyal patrons \u2013 tourists, dignitaries, and New Yorkers alike- who have visited Carnegie Deli over the past 80 years,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cSince my father took over the Deli in 1976, this has been a second home to me and it has been a true privilege and an honor to serve you.\u201d\n\nCraig DeGregorio, 38, of Long Island, said he waited for nearly 90 minutes to chow down on its signature dish, a mountainous, $20 pastrami sandwich. \u201cI figured this was the last chance I was going to get to come here,\u201d he said, adding that the visit was also his first. \u201cI really didn\u2019t mind waiting at all. The sandwich was huge. It took two bites to even make a dent.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe lines in the cold Friday started at 4:45 a.m. Nick from the Bronx said he waited in line for two hours.\n\n\u201cI came yesterday, the line was around the corner and I left very sad,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I said, you know I\u2019ll give it another shot and I came at 7. Everybody was reminiscent. It was wonderful.\u201d\n\nThe line was composed of people from all over.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m way down in the swamps of South Florida, heard of it, but didn\u2019t know what it was, now I do, so I\u2019m ready to go in,\u201d Steve Osceola told CBS New York.\n\n\u201cIt is delicious, we will miss it so much,\u201d one woman said.\n\n\u201cThe best in Manhattan,\u201d a man agreed. When asked whether it\u2019s worth the wait, he responded, \u201ctotally, I\u2019d do it again, and again and again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth the wait. My feet are still cold, but this is hot, this is hot,\u201d another woman said.\n\nThe Carnegie, its walls now lined with photos of celebrities who have eaten there, opened in 1937, drawing its name from Carnegie Hall just a block up 7th Avenue. Aside from the long lines out on the sidewalk (and unusually high prices), the place screams old New York, from its vintage neon sign, to the items on the menu: slices of cheesecake, knishes, tongue and chopped liver, and a $30 reuben. Another patron dining in the final days, Donna Nevens, of Elizabeth, New Jersey, said she wanted to be able to tell her friends she ate at the \u201cworld famous Carnegie deli\u201d at least once. \u201cIt\u2019s a New York institution,\u201d she said, anticipating she\u2019d order a \u201cWoody Allen,\u201d an overstuffed sandwich of half pastrami and half corned beef. The deli later named the sandwich after the director after he filmed key scenes for \u201cBroadway Danny Rose\u201d there. The deli has also been featured on several television shows, including \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and \u201cDr. Phil.\u201d Although the Carnegie has remained popular with tourists, New Yorkers these days are more likely to go looking for authenticity elsewhere at lower prices. And it\u2019s been a rough few years for the Carnegie. The restaurant reopened last February after being closed for nearly a year amid an investigation into a possible illegal natural gas hookup, discovered after a utility crew found a diverted line while they were investigating a leak. The personal lives of owner Marian Harper and her husband Sandy were thrust into the public spotlight with a messy divorce after she accused him of having an affair with a hostess and slipping her cash and pastrami recipes. The deli was also ordered to pay $2.6 million in back wages to its employees after a labor dispute. Harper has insisted the closure has nothing to do with any of those issues. She\u2019s said her long hours at the deli have taken a toll and she wants to take time to enjoy her life.

No larger than a speck of pepper, the Hemlock woolly adelgid spends its life on the underside of needles sucking sap, eventually killing the tree.\n\nThe bug is one in an expanding army of insects draining the life out of forests from New England to the West Coast. Aided by global trade, a warming climate and drought-weakened trees, the invaders have become one of the greatest threats to biodiversity in the United States.\n\nScientists say they already are driving some tree species toward extinction and are causing billions of dollars a year in damage \u2014 and the situation is expected to worsen.\n\n\u201cThey are one of the few things that can actually eliminate a forest tree species in pretty short order \u2014 within years,\u201d said Harvard University ecologist David Orwig as he walked past dead hemlocks scattered across the university\u2019s 5.8-square-mile research forest in Petersham.\n\nThis scourge is projected to put 63 percent of the country\u2019s forest at risk through 2027 and carries a cost of several billion dollars annually in dead tree removal, declining property values and timber industry losses, according to a peer-reviewed\u00a0study\u00a0this year in Ecological Applications.\n\nThat examination, by more than a dozen experts, found that hundreds of pests have invaded the nation\u2019s forests, and that the emerald ash borer alone has the potential to cause $12.7 billion in damage by 2020.\n\nInsect pests, some native and others from as far away as Asia, can undermine forest ecosystems. For example, scientists say, several species of hemlock and almost 20 species of ash could nearly go extinct in the coming decades. Such destruction would do away with a critical sponge to capture greenhouse gas emissions, shelter for birds and insects and food sources for bears and other animals. Dead forests also can increase the danger of catastrophic wildfires.\n\nToday\u2019s connected world enables foreign invaders to cross oceans in packing materials or on garden plants, and then reach American forests. Once here, they have rapidly expanded their ranges.\n\nWhile all 50 states have been attacked by pests, experts say forests in the Northeast, California, Colorado and parts of the Midwest, North Carolina and Florida are especially at risk. Forests in some states, like New York, are close to major trade routes, while others, like in Florida, house trees especially susceptible to pests. Others, like New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine, are experiencing record warming.\n\n\u201cThe primary driver of the invasive pest problem is globalization, which includes increased trade and travel,\u201d Andrew Liebhold, a Forest Service research entomologist in West Virginia. \u201cBut there are cases where climate change can play an important role. As climates warm, species are able to survive and thrive in more northerly areas.\u201d\n\nThe emerald ash borer, first found in 2002 in Michigan, is now in 30 states and has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees. The gypsy moth, discovered in 1869 in Boston, is now found in 20 states and has reached the northern Great Lakes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nNative bark beetles have taken advantage of warming conditions and a long western drought to rapidly range from Mexico into Canada. An outbreak in Colorado spread across 3.4 million acres of forest from 1996 to 2013, according to the Forest Service, and in California 100 million-plus trees have died in the Sierra Nevada since 2010.\n\nThough small, bugs can easily overwhelm big trees with sheer numbers.\n\n\u201cThey drain the resin that otherwise defends the tree,\u201d said Matt Ayres, a Dartmouth College ecologist who worked on the Ecological Applications study. \u201cThen, the tree is toast.\u201d\n\nForest pests in the era of climate change are especially concerning for timberland owners, said Jasen Stock, executive director of the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with pests we\u2019ve never been around before, never had to manage around before,\u201d Stock said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be dealing with forever.\u201d\n\nUrban forests, too, are at risk from outbreaks. In Worcester, Massachusetts, a city of about 180,000, an Asian longhorned beetle infestation in 2008 resulted in the removal of 31,000 trees.\n\n\u201cYou would leave for work with a tree-lined street, and you come back and there was not a tree in sight,\u201d recalled Ruth Seward, executive director of the nonprofit Worcester Tree Initiative. Most trees have since been replaced.\n\nThough trees can die off quickly, the impact of pests on a forest ecosystem can take decades to play out. Dead hemlocks, for example, are giving way to black birch and other hardwoods. Gone are favorite nesting spots for two types of warblers, as well as the bark that red squirrels love to eat, Harvard\u2019s Orwig said. The birds won\u2019t die off, he said, but their ranges will be restricted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great example of how one species can make a difference in the forest,\u201d Orwig said.\n\nAs pests proliferate, scientists seek to contain them.\n\nAmong the methods are bio controls, in which bugs that feed upon pests in their native lands are introduced here. Of the 30 states with emerald ash borer outbreaks, the USDA says 24 have released wasp species to combat them. Some scientists worry about introducing another pest; others complain they aren\u2019t effective because they can\u2019t eat enough of the fast-breeding pests to make a difference.\n\n\u201cWith all bio controls, the hope is to create balance \u2014 balance between predator and prey,\u201d said Ken Gooch, forest health program director for the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.\n\nGenetic modifications also offer promise.\n\nOn a research farm in Syracuse, New York, are rows of 10-foot chestnut trees tweaked with a wheat gene to make them resistant to chestnut blight, a fungus that came from Japan more than a century ago and killed millions of trees. Genetic engineering could likewise be applied to fight insects, said William Powell, a State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry professor directing the chestnut research.\n\nAn alternative strategy, also a slow one, is to plant trees 50 or 100 miles away from their normal range so they can escape pests, or adapt to a more favorable climate, said Steven Strauss, a professor of forest biotechnology at Oregon State University.\n\n\u201cMother Nature knows best,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s assisted migration.\u201d\n\nTo stop the next pest from entering the country, researchers like Gary M. Lovett, of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York, propose measures such as switching from solid wood shipping material that can harbor insects and restricting shrub and tree imports.\n\nNonetheless, Lovett said new pests are inevitable. \u201cWe have this burgeoning global trade,\u201d he said, \u201cso we will get a lot more of these.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.3135886192321795, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1048, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.1069104528400002, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.38549618320611, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/carrie-fisher-medical-emergency-audio-call-released/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [156, 668, 1114, 1347, 1841, 2040, 2366, 2723, 2809]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 608, "scraper_regex": 660}}, "headline": "Dramatic audio released of Carrie Fisher emergency call", "wordcount_as_scraped": 660, "date": "20161224200000", "story_content": "NEW YORK -- The pilot of the plane carrying actress Carrie Fisher as she suffered a medical emergency\u00a0told air traffic control, \u201cWe have an unresponsive passenger,\u201d according to audio from the flight.\n\nThe audio, which was released on Saturday by LiveATC.net and obtained by the Reuters news agency, offered insight into events as they unfolded during Fisher\u2019s medical emergency on Friday.

Almost two million brain cells die every minute during a stroke, so the odds of survival improve when emergency treatment begins quickly.\n\nAt Palmetto General Hospital outside Miami, there\u2019s just one surgeon who operates on all stroke victims. He performs about 100 emergency procedures every year, and he needs to be there whenever the call comes in, no matter what he happens to be doing. And he\u2019s found a new way to rush to the emergency room, reports CBS News correspondent David Begnaud.\u00a0\n\nDr. Ritesh Kaushal had to rush out during our interview when he received a call for a stroke patient.\n\n\u201cThey just announced it. Can we just try to find out what it is?\u201d Kaushal said as he headed out.\n\nKaushal often has to drive in to treat stroke victims. Depending on the time of day, his 15-minute commute can easily stretch to 45 minutes. \n\n\u201dJust the amount of damage that can happen in just about half-an-hour delay is spectacular,\u201d the endovascular neurosurgeon said. \n\nBut to get quickly to his patients, Kaushal uses emergency lights on his personal car, speeding his arrival to folks like Robert Buslow, whose family dialed 911 when he suddenly had trouble tying his shoes and sweeping the porch.\u201dHow bad was it?\u201d Begnaud asked.\n\n\u201cIt was considered a fatal stroke if it wasn\u2019t taken care of,\u201d Buslow said.\n\nThe neurosurgeon did take care of it, before Buslow even knew what was happening. \n\n\u201dAnd he must\u2019ve gotten there very quick because the moment I got in there, I was in the scanners going from one to the other and then all of a sudden, he got it out,\u201d Buslow said.  Just as he did for the patient who arrived when we were there, Kaushal pulled out a tiny blood clot.\n\n\u201cIf I did not have the light or if it had taken me another half an hour to get to him, things would\u2019ve been different. Potentially he probably would\u2019ve been paralyzed on the right side and would\u2019ve never been able to speak,\u201d Kaushal said.\n\n\u201cThe reason I have absolutely no ill effects is because, you know, Dr. Kaushal got there very, very quick,\u201d Buslow said.\n\nWe mounted a camera inside of his car to see how it works. He has no sirens and sometimes he honks his horn. But it\u2019s the lights that allow him to drive on the shoulder of the highway around traffic backups. \n\nThe fire department installed them after checking to make sure it was legal. \u201cStill has to abide by all traffic laws,\u201d said Hialeah Fire Chief Miguel Anchia. \u201cRight. So he has to stop at the red lights, go the speed limit. He can just sort of move through the back-up on the freeway,\u201d Begnaud said.\n\n\u201cAnd as people see the vehicle coming, they usually yield,\u201d Anchia said. \n\n\u201cIt does have risks. There are accidents that occur, crashes that occur,\u201d said Dr. Douglas Kupas of the National Association of State EMS Officials. \n\nKupas said EMS medical directors sometimes respond to scenes with lights and sirens on their cars. But he said this is the first he\u2019s heard of a surgeon using emergency lights. \n\nDr. Kaushal only uses the lights when there\u2019s a jam. He worked 350 days last year and measures success by the minute.\u201dWhat we see is that any of these delays, those brain cells really translate to this person being able to walk out this hospital on his own or go to a nursing home and be paralyzed for the rest of his life,\u201d Kaushal said.\n\nHealth officials suggest the best way for stroke victims to save time is to recognize the symptoms \u2013 things like a drooping face, arm weakness or speech problems \u2013 and to get help as soon as possible.\n\nKaushal said he\u2019s used the lights seven times since having them installed in September. He said final approval came from his wife \u2013 on the condition he buys more life insurance.

Such state measures are seen as a key backup if the federal mandate is repealed.\n\n\u201cWhat we have are couples facing a decision about which birth control method to use and they see that methods used by women have no out-of-pocket cost while there would be a cost, in some cases a fairly substantial cost, for men\u2019s,\u201d said Adam Sonfield, a policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health issues.\n\nThe Association of Reproductive Health Professionals says excluding vasectomies from the contraceptive coverage mandate doesn\u2019t make sense financially and reflects the view that family planning is a \u201cwoman\u2019s issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cBirth control cannot be the sole responsibility of the woman in a relationship,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who introduced New York\u2019s proposed law.\n\nSuch changes could be significant because, according to Guttmacher studies, nearly a quarter of women using birth control would prefer male-only methods of condoms and vasectomies. Neither method had been included among the cost-free options in \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nThe mandate covers the 18 Food and Drug Administration-approved methods of birth control used by women, including pills, patches, shots, implants, IUDs, cervical rings and caps, sponges, spermicide, female condoms, emergency pills and surgical sterilization.\n\nMost state Medicaid programs provide free access to all birth control methods, including those for men.\n\nBut the only way to add vasectomies to the no-copay contraceptive coverage mandated for private insurance plans by \u201cObamacare\u201d is to expand the law, which is unlikely to happen given current repeal efforts.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why some states have been looking at this,\u201d Sonfield said.\n\nOver the past two years, California, Illinois, Vermont and Maryland have passed laws requiring private insurance companies to cover contraception without out-of-pocket costs, and all but California include vasectomies.\n\nNew York\u2019s Legislature is considering a cost-free contraception coverage law that includes vasectomies after a similar measure stalled in a Senate committee last year. Vermont\u2019s mandate covers vasectomies but not condoms.\n\nThe health insurance industry opposes the mandate.\n\n\u201cOur objection isn\u2019t to including vasectomy, but mandating that it be free of charge,\u201d said Leslie Moran, senior vice president of the New York Health Plan Association. \u201cAt a time when we are looking to ensure affordability, we shouldn\u2019t be looking to add new requirements and new costs that would be borne by all premium payers.\u201d\n\nA vasectomy, which blocks sperm from getting to the seminal fluid, is an outpatient procedure that takes 20 minutes or less and is done with a local anesthetic. A no-scalpel option uses a tiny puncture to reach both sperm tubes and tie them off. It costs up to $1,000, according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nSome private insurers already cover vasectomies with no out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\u201cMy insurance plan fully covered it, so cost was not an issue,\u201d said Vermont state Rep.

The transmitters send heart device data back to medical professionals. Abbott Laboratories\u2019 St. Jude said in a statement it was not aware of deaths or injuries caused by the problem. The Food and Drug Administration also said there was no evidence patients were harmed. The federal investigation into the problem started in August. MedSec CEO Justine Bone said on Twitter that St. Jude\u2019s software fix did not address all problems in the devices. St. Jude\u2019s devices treat dangerous irregular heart rhythms that can cause cardiac failure or arrest. Implanted under the skin of the chest, the devices electronically pace heartbeats and shock the heart back to its normal rhythm when dangerous pumping patterns are detected.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s Merlinhome Transmitter electronically sends details on the device\u2019s performance to a website where the patient\u2019s physician can review the information. But that device can also be hacked. The FDA\u2019s review is ongoing, agency spokeswoman Angela Stark said. Its investigation confirmed the vulnerabilities of the home transmitter, which could potentially be hacked and used to rapidly deplete an implanted device battery, alter pacing and potentially administer inappropriate and dangerous shocks to a person\u2019s heart. The software patch issued by St. Jude \u201caddresses vulnerabilities that present the greatest risk to patients,\u201d Stark said. Stark said the company is working to address remaining vulnerabilities quickly. She said any new cardiac devices submitted to the FDA for review that use the affected transmitter will not be cleared or approved without the software update. St. Jude disclosed details about the problem after it merged with Abbott. The company has previously denied findings that their devices could be hacked and filed a lawsuit against Muddy Waters LLC and MedSec, alleging that they tried to manipulate the markets to profit from the vulnerability research disclosures. The revelations about a hacker\u2019s ability to potentially gain remote access and affect even the workings of a human heart shed light on the pressing problems of cybersecurity in an increasingly networked world. The advisory also highlights the dilemma for security researchers who may feel an obligation to inform the public of possible dangers but don\u2019t want to cause unnecessary panic. \u201cYour average patient isn\u2019t going to be targeted by assassins,\u201d said Matthew Green, an assistant professor for computer science at Johns Hopkins University. He was hired by Muddy Waters to help validate the MedSec findings after St. Jude filed its lawsuit. \u201cAn attack on this level is low-probability but very high-impact.\u201d He called it \u201cprobably the most impactful vulnerability I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Green said many of the more severe vulnerabilities identified by MedSec for the devices themselves have not been fixed, but the new software would make the home system a little more secure. The FDA has been urging manufacturers to update their products, software and security measures since at least 2013. However, agency guidelines issued last year are not binding. The FDA does not review the vast majority of cyber security updates made to devices, under its own rules intended to streamline medical device upgrades. In 2015 the FDA issued two separate safety alerts to hospitals over drug pumps made by Hospira, now owned by Pfizer. In the second notice, regulators told hospitals to stop using the company\u2019s Symbiq Infusion System after the company confirmed the system could be remotely hacked, allowing an outside party to potentially reprogram the drug pumps. The devices are used to slowly dose intravenous drugs for pain, infection, nutrition and other uses and are usually programmed through a wireless hospital network. No patient injuries were reported in connection with the issue, but the agency urged users \u201cto begin transitioning to alternative infusion systems as soon as possible.\u201d Hospira discontinued the pumps for unrelated reasons prior to the FDA announcement, according to the agency.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.57717227935791, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 715, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.60641294306, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.23776223776224, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-police-chief-apologizing-1940-lynching/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1106, "scraper_regex": 1215}}, "headline": "Georgia police chief apologizing for agency's role in 1940 lynching", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1215, "date": "20170126150000", "story_content": "This article first appeared in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nLAGRANGE, Ga. -- It\u2019s been more than 75 years since an armed posse of white men snatched Austin Callaway from the LaGrange city jail, drove through darkness to a country road and killed him with gunshots to the head, arms and hands.\n\nThere was no effort to identify his killers, no criminal investigation and no discussion by city police about their complicity in the lynching of the young African-American man. In essence, Callaway\u2019s death was scrubbed from the city record.\n\nYet like so many other acts of racial terror across the South, his violent end lived in the collective memory of the local black community and contributed to its distrust of police. Now the city\u2019s police chief is ready to offer a public apology for his agency\u2019s role in the 1940 lynching - an extraordinary admission that is believed to be among the first of its kind.\n\n\u201cThis was brutal,\u201d said LaGrange Police Chief Lou Dekmar, who is white. \u201cIt represented injustice, specifically to an individual and impacted a community generally because of the apprehension it created to deal with authorities... I think an acknowledgement and apology is needed to help us understand how the past forms and impacts the present. It makes it clear what was done was wrong.\u201d\n\nThe chief \u2018s remarks will take place at a ceremony of remembrance Thursday evening that will include the city\u2019s mayor, local NAACP, the president of LaGrange College and Callaway\u2019s descendants.\n\nDeborah Tatum said she hopes the ceremony will offer a chance to celebrate her relative in a way her family wasn\u2019t able to.\n\n\u201cI believe in prayer,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe in destiny. Seventy-seven years later here we are talking about it. It couldn\u2019t be talked about in 1940.\u201d\n\nThe unprecedented ceremony comes as the police profession across America wrestles with its tense relationship with the black community.\n\nIn 2015 the U.S. Department of Justice launched a program to build community trust with minorities. The program, which includes a reconciliation component, is in a pilot stage in six communities across the country, including Minneapolis and Birmingham.\n\nAnd last fall the head of one of the largest police groups in the country, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, acknowledged and apologized for his profession\u2019s historical mistreatment of minority communities. That came three years after a police chief in Montgomery apologized to Rep. John Lewis for his agency\u2019s failure to protect Freedom Riders in 1961.\n\nDekmar is believed to be the first police chief in the South to apologize for his department\u2019s role in the legacy of lynchings that claimed more than 4,000 black lives across the region between 1877 and 1950.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for those agencies, those institutions that have been responsible for some very bad things that have never been acknowledged,\u201d said David Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law who has studied racial profiling by police.\n\nPolice often played a role in lynchings across the region, even if they weren\u2019t directly involved in carrying out the violence, said E.M. Beck, a University of Georgia sociology professor who is an expert in the history of lynching in America. Law enforcement routinely let lynch mobs take a person from their custody and after the person was killed there was often little effort to investigate or determine who carried out the violence.\n\nHe said he\u2019s not familiar with another instance of a law enforcement chief going back into this history to admit the role their own agency played.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very significant,\u201d said Beck. \u201cThere\u2019s an acknowledgement that justice was not done.\u201d\n\nIn Callaway\u2019s case, little was known in LaGrange about the incident.\n\n\u201cA lot of this history of Austin was hidden,\u201d said Ernest Ward, a local educator and president of the Troup County NAACP. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t want it to be told.\u201d\n\nThat started to change the past few years. Dekmar, who has been the city\u2019s chief for 22 years, had never heard about the lynching until a couple years ago. Two older black women were in the police department and a detective overheard them commenting on a black-and-white photo on the wall that showed officers from long ago.\n\nOne of the women said: \u201cThey killed our people.\u201d\n\nWhen the chief heard this story, he found there was no record in the police department about the case. What he learned disturbed him.\n\nThe city was also in the process of trying to improve race relations. Eventually, after further research and conversations with Ward at the NAACP and leaders in the city government, Dekmar believed it was important to publicly acknowledge and apologize for his agency\u2019s part in the lynching.\n\n\u201cThe nature of apologies is to acknowledge when something in the past was done that was wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nCallaway, whose age was believed to be about 18 at the time of the lynching, had been accused of assaulting a white woman on Sept. 7, 1940, a Saturday. He was arrested and taken to the city jail, which at the time was in the basement of what today is city hall in this town about 67 miles southwest of Atlanta.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, the police had been dispatched to a fire across town. A young 20-year-old man was left behind to man the jail. About 2 a.m., a group of six armed white men showed up and overwhelmed the young man. The posse, who reportedly were masked, took Callaway and drove to a country road miles outside of town.\n\nA motorist discovered him in the road five hours later. He was unconscious and bleeding from his wounds.\n\nThe police complicity in the lynching was suspicious from the start, said Wesley Edwards, co-founder of a biracial community group, Troup Together. The police didn\u2019t order an immediate search for Callaway and there\u2019s no record of an investigation - or even a coroner\u2019s inquest. There was no outcry from the white community, he said.\n\n\u201cIt was really swept aside,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole matter was silenced.\u201d\n\nA hero of the story was a local pastor, the Rev. Louie W. Strickland, who in 1940 tried to draw attention to the case. His former church, Warren Temple United Methodist Church, will be the site of a lynching memorial expected to be created later this year and it will host Thursday\u2019s service of reconciliation and remembrance.\n\nDescendants of Callaway who still live in LaGrange will be at the event.\n\nTatum, 59, still lives in LaGrange and her husband is retired from the city police department. She grew up in the same neighborhood where Callaway was living at the time he was killed, but it was only a few years ago that she learned about the violent chapter in her family\u2019s history.\n\nShe thinks the city\u2019s effort to reconcile its past wrongs is a good thing and hopes the attention will help bring forth additional information. She said adults in the black community often shielded their children from this violent history; it wasn\u2019t taught in the local schools and much about the case remains a mystery.\n\n\u201cSeventy-seven years later and here we are talking about Austin,\u201d she said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 20, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.4398033618927, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1106, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 11, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.867687113860001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 50, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126150000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.52079566003617, "mft_mean": 4.54545454545}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/iowa-police-shooting-scott-michael-greene-desperate-money/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Iowa police shooting: Scott Michael Greene was \"desperate\" for money", "wordcount_as_scraped": 802, "date": "20161103210000", "story_content": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- An Iowa man charged Thursday with fatally shooting two police officers in ambush-style attacks was under intense financial pressure and had been ordered to move out of his mother\u2019s basement just hours before the slayings.\n\nScott Michael Greene, 46, was arrested Thursday afternoon after detectives questioned him at the Des Moines police station. Greene was secured with the handcuffs that had belonged to the patrolmen who were killed, Des Moines Sgt. Anthony Beminio and Urbandale officer Justin Martin, and was being transported to the county jail.\n\nGreene was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. If convicted, he would receive an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole. A statement from Des Moines police said the investigation has produced probable cause to support the charges but didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nPolice said earlier Thursday that a search dog recovered a high-powered rifle in a wooded area that they believe Greene used to fire on the officers. Greene had been hospitalized for treatment of a pre-existing medical condition following his surrender Wednesday morning. He left the hospital Thursday.\n\nCourt documents show that Greene, an unemployed father who lived in the Des Moines suburb of Urbandale, was increasingly desperate for money in recent weeks.\n\nDistrict Judge Carla Schemmel ruled Tuesday that Greene had committed elder abuse against his 66-year-old mother, Patricia Greene, by \u201cphysically hitting and financially exploiting\u201d her. She ordered him to move out of his mother\u2019s home, where he had been living in a basement bedroom, before Nov. 6 and to stay away from the home for a year.\n\nPatricia Greene had applied for the restraining order Oct. 19, two days after she was arrested and charged with striking her son in the face during an altercation that he had recorded with his cellphone. She wrote in the application that she believed her son \u201cset me up to get me in trouble.\u201d Patricia Greene wrote that while she was in jail, Scott Greene told one of her friends that Patricia Greene needed to give him $20,000 and that if his mother paid, \u201che would move and not bother\u201d her again.\n\nPatricia Greene also wrote that her son had sent \u201ca bunch of rambling, offensive\u201d text messages, warned that he would no longer take care of her cat and was going through her personal belongings. She said her son had subjected her to mental, emotional and financial abuse.\n\nA temporary protective order was issued Oct. 20. Schemmel issued the permanent order during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, where it was served on Scott Greene. The order, which warned that any violations would lead to his arrest, also directed Greene to return $10,000 to his mother and to not take any of her assets.\n\nBeminio, 38, and Martin, 24, were shot after 1 a.m. Wednesday while sitting in their patrol cars in separate incidents less than 2 miles apart. Several bullets were fired into the vehicles.\n\nThe .223-caliber rifle believed to be used was discovered Wednesday by a dog with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives apparently hidden in a wooded area \u201cwhere no person probably could have found it,\u201d said Des Moines police spokesman Sgt. Paul Parizek.\n\nParizek became emotional Thursday during a news conference, where he thanked the community for its outpouring of support and said the officers represent \u201cthe security blanket you guys sleep under every night.\u201d He said a motive for the shootings remains unclear.\n\nGreene was hired last month to work at Central Iowa Fencing, a small construction business in suburban Des Moines, but quit within days, a manager there said Thursday.\n\nGreene \u201cwas pretty desperate\u201d for a job and told the company he had a teenage daughter he needed to support, officer manager Sara Nicklin said. Greene initially contacted the company looking for work last summer but there were no openings. The company gave Greene a chance after he inquired again last month, even though he had no experience building fences, Nicklin said.\n\nShe said Greene was sent home on the morning of his third day of employment \u201cbecause he was not taking directions and wasn\u2019t working.\u201d Nicklin said the company gave Greene the chance to come back the next day on a different crew but \u201che chose not to show up\u201d and quit instead.\n\n\u201cHe just didn\u2019t like the work,\u201d Nicklin said.\n\nGreene posted a video on YouTube last week of a cellphone recording showing a worker driving a truck. Greene wrote below the video that he \u201cwas fired\u201d by Central Iowa Fencing after reporting unsafe driving.\n\nNicklin said she hasn\u2019t seen the video but denied that Greene was fired.

It followed a report on the investigation that was issued by ACS itself.\n\nZymere died on Sept. 26, and the New York City medical examiner\u2019s office ruled that his death was caused by fatal child abuse syndrome - meaning Zymere had evidence of acute and chronic abuse in the form of fresh injuries and old scars.\n\nThe prior complaints were filed between June 22, 2010, and April 18 of this year, the state said.\n\nThe ACS complaint reports contained repeated claims of drug and alcohol abuse by Zymere\u2019s parents, excessive corporal punishment and inadequate guardianship of Zymere by his mother and her boyfriend, the state said.\n\n\u201cThe level of casework activity for all cases was insufficient and was particularly lacking given the family circumstances,\u201d the state report said.\n\nZymere\u2019s mother, 26-year-old Geraldine Perkins, and her boyfriend, 42-year-old Rysheim Smith, have been charged with child endangerment.\n\nThe state report concluded that ACS \u201cdid not conduct thorough investigations and/or follow regulatory standards\u201d and said there were \u201cspecific points when timely and appropriate intervention could have assisted the family\u2019s functioning\u201d but did not happen.\n\nThe state said ACS conducted \u201cinterviews of poor quality,\u201d did not correctly assess issues such as possible domestic violence and mental health problems within the family and failed to investigate properly in numerous other ways.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the state investigation in September, and following the probe, the state on Dec. 1 ordered ACS to appoint an independent monitor that the state must approve, the state said. The report said Mayor Bill de Blasio accepted the order on Tuesday.\n\nDe Blasio added in a statement that three ACS employees involved in Zymere\u2019s case have been fired and the city has also moved to suspend and demote six more employees.\n\n\u201cThis report uncovered a troubling series of lapses and missed opportunities in ACS\u2019s failed effort to protect Zymere Perkins,\u201d the mayor said in the statement. \u201cProcedures were not followed, common sense was not exercised and due diligence was lacking up and down the chain of command responsible for Zymere. I will not accept excuses for this failure and I will not accept the notion that every single one of these tragedies cannot be prevented. The buck stops with me.\u201d\n\nThe state report detailed and sharply criticized the handling of each prior ACS complaint.\n\nOn April 18 of this year, ACS received a complaint that Zymere had arrived at school with multiple bruises and scratches on both legs, the state said. The school nurse noted that he seemed to be in pain, the state said.\n\nZymere claimed that he had fallen off his scooter and that his cousins had been hitting him, the state report said.\n\nZymere was taken in for an interview with an ACS detective, and his mother was overheard asking him if he told the ACS staff \u201cthe truth,\u201d saying the school would \u201cback off\u201d if he did, the state said.\n\nThe mother also denied abuse allegations and claimed that Zymere had been with a maternal aunt in Brooklyn, the state said. But ACS never followed up with the boy\u2019s aunt, and after Zymere died, maternal relatives said they had not seen him in months, the state said.\n\nZymere also said he was spanked when he did not behave, but the ACS specialist who interviewed him never asked who spanked him, the state said.\n\nThe state said the ACS investigation into the April 18 incident was \u201cgrossly incomplete and lacked documentation, proper casework assessment, and supervisory and managerial oversight.\u201d\n\nThe report said Zymere\u2019s saying he was spanked should have \u201cprompted a deeper investigation,\u201d but it went on to say, \u201cInstead, ACS closed this investigation as \u2018unfounded.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 2, ACS received allegations that Zymere was being abused by his mother and her partner, the state said. ACS received a report that the boy had a broken jaw in October 2015, and a short time earlier, he had been reported to have scratches near his eye and a tooth knocked out, the state said.\n\nZymere\u2019s mother said each injury was caused by a fall and said he was \u201cclumsy and falls a lot,\u201d the state said.\n\nThe state said ACS did not consider the remark a \u201cpossible red flag for a referral for medical follow up.\u201d\n\nACS dismissed as unfounded the allegation that Zymere had suffered a fracture on the grounds that a \u201cmedical professional\u201d had determined that he did not have a broken jaw, the state said. The claim came from Zymere\u2019s mother, and ACS never tried to contact the medical professional, the state said.\n\nIn an earlier report, Zymere told ACS that he was beaten by his mother\u2019s partner with a belt and \u201cwent back and forth\u201d with claims that he was put in a cold shower as punishment, the state said.\n\nACS also received reports in June 2015 that Zymere\u2019s mother\u2019s partner hit him 20 times on his buttocks and legs as punishment at a picnic, the report said.\n\nACS interviewed the mother\u2019s partner in 2015, and he admitted that he assisted the mother in disciplining Zymere, the state said. He denied placing the boy under a cold shower but said he would take Zymere to a store, show him toys and tell Zymere he couldn\u2019t have any of the toys because was \u201cbeing bad,\u201d the state said.\n\nACS substantiated a claim of inadequate guardianship over the use of cold showers as discipline, but unsubstantiated a claim of excessive corporal punishment by Zymere\u2019s mother for reasons unexplained, the state said.\n\nThe state said ACS never added an allegation of emotional abuse based on the other \u201ccruel methods of \u2018discipline\u2019\u201d that were alleged.\n\nZymere\u2019s mother first came into contact with ACS just after he was born in 2010, when she tested positive for marijuana after giving birth, the state said. But Zymere\u2019s toxicology report was negative and the medical staff indicated her marijuana use did not affect him, so the report was dismissed as unfounded, the state said.\n\nThe state OCFS report was released just one day after Gladys Carri\u00f3n suddenly resigned as ACS commissioner. Carri\u00f3n wrote a letter to de Blasio saying she had decided to resign \u201cafter much thought and deliberation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have struggled with this decision but have come to the conclusion that it is best for my well-being,\u201d Carri\u00f3n wrote in her resignation letter. \u201cAfter 40 years of working on behalf of children and families, it is time for me to retire.\u201d\n\nIn October, Carri\u00f3n broke down in tears during a City Council hearing regarding Zymere\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cLosing a child is unbearable, and it\u2019s my responsibility, and one that I take seriously,\u201d Carri\u00f3n said at the Oct. 31 hearing.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office said Carri\u00f3n was not asked to step down.

Gen. Haider Fadhil of Iraq\u2019s special forces, using an Arabic acronym for the extremists. He added that more than 20 militants had been killed while his forces suffered only one light injury from a fall.\n\nThree suicide car bombers had tried to stop the advance before the army took control of Bazwaya, but the troops destroyed them, he said. The army said another unit, its 9th Division, had moved toward Mosul and was about 3 miles from its eastern outskirts, the neighborhood of Gogjali.\n\nAt one point, a Humvee packed with explosives raced ahead and tried to ram the approaching forces, but Iraqi troops opened fire, blowing it up. Plumes of smoke rose from ISIS positions hit by artillery and airstrikes that the army said came from the U.S.-led coalition.\n\nState TV described the operation as a \u201cbattle of honor\u201d to liberate the city, which was captured by ISIS from a superior yet neglected Iraqi force in 2014.\n\nSome residents hung white flags on buildings and windows in a sign they would not resist government troops, said Maj. Salam al-Obeidi, a member of the special forces operation in Bazwaya. He said troops asked villagers to stay in their homes as Iraqi forces moved through the streets -- a precaution against possible suicide bombers.\n\nAs night fell, broken glass in the streets glistened from the light of some burning houses, with several buildings suffering collapsed roofs from airstrikes. The army estimates hundreds of families are in the village, but few ventured out.\n\nSince Oct. 17, Iraqi forces and their Kurdish allies, Sunni tribesmen and Shiite militias have been converging on Mosul from all directions. Entering Gogjali could be the start of a new slog for the troops, as they\u2019ll be forced to engage in difficult, house-to-house fighting in more urban areas. The operation is expected to take weeks, if not months.\n\nIraqi forces have made uneven progress. Advances have been slower south of the city, with government troops still 20 miles away.\n\nThe U.S. military estimates ISIS has 3,000-5,000 fighters in Mosul and another 1,500-2,500 in its outer defensive belt. The total includes about 1,000 foreign fighters.\n\nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi appeared on state TV in combat fatigues and urged ISIS fighters in Mosul to surrender.\n\n\u201cWe will close in on Daesh from all angles and, God willing, we will cut the snake\u2019s head,\u201d he said while visiting troops in the town of Shura, south of Mosul.\n\n\u201cThey will have no way out, and no way to escape,\u201d he said. \u201cEither they die, or surrender.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, thousands of fighters flocked to join Iraq\u2019s state-sanctioned, Iran-backed Shiite militias who aim to cut off Mosul from the west. In a series of apparent retaliatory attacks, bombs exploded in five of Baghdad\u2019s mostly Shiite neighborhoods, killing at least 17 people.\n\nThe deadliest -- a parked car bomb -- hit a popular fruit and vegetable market near a school in the northwestern Hurriyah area, killing at least 10 people and wounding 34. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nSeparate attacks Monday in and around Baghdad killed at least 16 people and wounded about 50, police said. The deadliest was in the northern Shalla neighborhood when a car bomb ripped through a popular market area, killing at least eight civilians and wounding 23, police said.\n\nMedical officials confirmed the casualty figures.

That\u2019s because the presidential election is decided by the Electoral College, and not the national popular vote.\n\nIt\u2019s a process that was established by the Constitution that says a candidate can only be elected president if he or she wins a majority of the 538 electors. Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, therefore, must secure at least 270 electoral votes to win the White House. \n\nA political party\u2019s slate of electors is chosen on Election Day in each state, and in most, it\u2019s based on which ticket wins the most votes. Electors then meet in mid-December to officially cast one vote for president and one vote for vice president. \n\nFormer President Bill Clinton happens to be among the Democratic Party\u2019s slate of electors in New York, which also includes Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general who\u2019s been investigating the activities of Donald Trump\u2019s foundation. In the unlikely outcome that Trump wins New York, his son Donald Trump Jr. and Carl Paladino are on the state\u2019s slate of Republican electors. \n\nEach state\u2019s allotted number of electoral votes is equal to the size of each state\u2019s congressional delegation. Texas, for example, has 38 electors, which means the state has 36 members in the House of Representatives plus its two senators. California has the most electoral votes, 55, and a few states like the Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming have as few as three. Washington, D.C. also has three electoral votes. \n\nMost states distribute electoral votes through a winner-take-all system, so if Clinton were to win the battleground state of Arizona, 11 electors selected by the state\u2019s Democratic Party would be elected to the Electoral College. Maine and Nebraska operate under a different system, whereby the winner of each congressional district is awarded one electoral vote each and the winner of the statewide vote is awarded each state\u2019s remaining two electoral votes.\n\nProponents of reforming the Electoral College, like FairVote\u2019s Executive Director Rob Richie, argue that the current system leads to candidates ignoring many states during the general election. \n\nAs of Wednesday, the group found that 92.5 percent of campaign activity has happened in just 11 battleground states. More than half of the activity, it said, has occurred in just four states.\n\nNext Tuesday, voters will select a presidential candidate, but they\u2019ll technically be casting ballots for a candidate\u2019s party\u2019s slate of electors. Based on the returns that flow in that night, analysts will be able to quickly calculate who won the electoral votes in each state.\n\nOn Dec. 19, each state\u2019s winning slate of electors is expected to meet in person in state capitals to cast one ballot for president and one for vice president. Those vote counts are then sent to the government by late December. \n\nOn the afternoon of Jan. 6, unless the date is changed, the vice president, Joe Biden, will open the electoral votes before a joint session of the new Congress where they will be counted. \n\nIf there is a tie in the Electoral College or if no candidate receives 270 electoral votes, the House would elect the next president based on the three presidential candidates who receive the most electoral votes, with one vote per state delegation, and the Senate would elect the vice president. Only two presidents have been elected by the House: Thomas Jefferson in 1801 and John Quincy Adams in 1825. \n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t provide too many details about who can serve as an elector except that no sitting senator or House member can be appointed as one. Political parties in each state generally choose their slate of electors. \n\nSome of the other Democratic electors this cycle include Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, in Florida; Christine Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s daughter, in California; and former Rep. Gabby Giffords in Arizona. \n\nNotable Republican electors include Pam Bondi, attorney general of Florida; Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, in Maryland; and Sean Spicer, communicators director and chief strategist at the RNC, in Virginia.\n\nThere is no Constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote for whom they are pledged. Twenty-six states and D.C., however, bind their electors to vote for their promised candidates. People who vote for someone other than for whom they are pledged are known as \u201cfaithless electors\u201d and they\u2019ve never decided a presidential election. \u201cFaithless electors\u201d are rare, with only one in each of the 1948, 1956, 1960, 1968, 1972, 1976 and 1988 elections. \n\nThis year, however, there could potentially be more \u201cfaithless electors\u201d within the GOP because of the some internal party opposition to Trump, said John Hudak, deputy director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution. He warned that dynamic could potentially cause problems.\n\n\u201cIf there were a tie at 269, or if Donald Trump got 270 or 271 votes, I think there\u2019s a real risk of a couple of electors voting for someone else in an effort to throw the race into the House,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2013, nearly two-thirds of the public, 63 percent, said they wanted to get rid of it, according to a Gallup poll, which found only 29 percent said they were against doing away with the system.\n\nHundreds of proposals have been introduced in Congress to change the process, none of them successful. The effort to reform the system has gained momentum in the past when a candidate has won the national popular vote, but lost an election. It\u2019s happened only three times since the beginning of the two-party system, with the most recent being in 2000 when Al Gore won about 540,000 votes more than George W. Bush nationally. Bush, however, won the Electoral College 271-266.\n\nA movement to implement a plan that would elect the president based on the national popular vote has been slowly spreading across the U.S. The plan has been introduced in 50 state legislatures and so far, 10 states as well as D.C. have passed such legislation totaling 165 electoral votes. If enough additional states also passed the plan so that they have at least 270 electoral votes, the plan could actually take effect.\n\n\u201cI feel very bullish about the popular vote proposal,\u201d said Richie. \u201cI think that there\u2019s every reason to expect that it will pass if not by 2020, by 2024. I think it actually has a real shot for 2020.\u201d\n\nExperts say it\u2019s not completely clear what reform would lead to except that it\u2019s clear that big cities would play a much larger role in presidential elections.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat you will see is significant money in New York and Houston, in Miami, in L.A., and in Chicago,\u201d said Hudak. \u201cYou\u2019ll see big cities in red states, big cities in blue states being targeted,\u201d adding that Republicans might also have to target some rural areas as well.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think the original reason for [the Electoral College] is still very much valid today,\u201d said Hans A. von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, who supports keeping the system. \u201cThe framers were afraid that if the presidency was just based on the national popular vote, then candidates would simply go to the big cities and ignore the rural parts of the country.\u201d\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.911161720752716, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1192, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.98758403627, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161104110000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.76174496644295, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-carolina-governor-race-recount-to-continue-after-board-of-elections-dismisses-complaint/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [523, 895]}}, "headline": "N.C. governor's race recount to continue", "wordcount_as_scraped": 555, "date": "20161204070000", "story_content": "RALEIGH, N.C. --The State Board of Elections dismissed a complaint originating from a rural North Carolina county that could have prevented scores of ballots from being counted in close races for governor and auditor. The board voted 3-2 on Saturday to reject the protest from a Bladen County candidate, who with assistance from Republican Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s campaign, alleged workers for a political committee that received Democratic funds fraudulently filled out absentee ballots.\u00a0\n\nLawyers pushing the complaint suggested the board could throw out as many as 419 mail-in absentee ballots. They said evidence showed that a losing write-in candidate for soil and water conservation district supervisor showed up on nearly 170 ballots and may have originated from only seven people. The lawyers said none of those ballots should be tallied for any races.\u00a0\n\nRemoving hundreds of ballots from Bladen County wouldn\u2019t have a major impact on the top races, but could play a role in whether there is a statewide recount. Democrat Roy Cooper leads McCrory by about 10,250 votes while Democratic State Auditor Beth Wood leads Republican Chuck Stuber by nearly 6,000 votes. A trailing candidate can receive a statewide recount if the margin is 10,000 votes or less. Republican elections board member James Baker joined the panel\u2019s two Democrats in dismissing the complaint, saying voters signed the absentee ballots. There was no substantial evidence to suggest the choices weren\u2019t their own, they said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we could deprive them of their vote ... for every other race because we have some pretty serious misgivings about the soil and water race,\u201d Baker said at the close of four hours of testimony and discussion. The board\u2019s other two Republicans voted against dismissal. The state board, which has been scrutinizing this fall\u2019s election and absentee ballots in Bladen County, did vote unanimously to send what its investigators have uncovered to the U.S. attorney in Raleigh. The board has not disclosed what it has found. Roger Knight, a McCrory campaign attorney, said he didn\u2019t believe the dismissal would be appealed to court unless the margin with Cooper narrowed. McCrory said in a release Saturday night he would also ask the State Bureau of Investigation to examine the Bladen County voting to \u201censure that every vote is counted accurately and that our elections process is conducted legally.\u201d Irving Joyner, an attorney representing the Bladen political committee, said workers complied with state law in helping people cast write-in votes on absentee ballots and that adding a write-in candidate alone isn\u2019t unlawful. McCrory has suggested he wouldn\u2019t demand a statewide recount if a review of more than 94,000 votes in Durham County showed the same results. Durham County workers began the recount Saturday - a day earlier than previously scheduled - and counted almost 20,000 votes. They resume work Sunday and are supposed to be done by Monday night. The State Board of Elections ordered the Durham recount of ballots tabulated during early voting and at one Election Day precinct. Technical challenges on election night led to a late release of those ballot totals, flipping the statewide leader from McCrory to Cooper. \u201cWe need to move forward and get this done,\u201d Durham board Chairman Bill Brian said Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted by it and I think (Durham) is exhausted by it.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.52733683586121, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 535, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.67217062849, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161204070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8037383177570097, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-is-carl-icahn-meet-the-billionaire-adviser-to-donald-trump-on-regulatory-reforms/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [831, 1589, 1590, 1736, 3854, 4107, 4634]}}, "headline": "Meet Carl Icahn, the billionaire advising Trump on regulations", "wordcount_as_scraped": 768, "date": "20161223130000", "story_content": "During the election campaign, Donald Trump called for a dramatic overhaul of the federal government regulatory apparatus. He argued that 70 percent of federal regulations could be eliminated, and he promised to cut two of them for every new one that\u2019s enacted. To turn his vision into reality, President-elect Trump has turned to another billionaire, this time in the role of special adviser: Carl Icahn.\n\nNow 80 years old, Icahn is chairman of Icahn Enterprises (IEP) and made his fortune on Wall Street as an activist investor. That means he buys stocks that he considers to be undervalued, presses the company\u2019s board of directors for dramatic changes (which often means a sale of the company) and sells the shares at a tidy profit when investors bid up their price.\u00a0\n\nHe has tangled with a myriad of businesses, ranging from airlines such as the now-defunct TWA to media conglomerates such as Viacom (VIA.B) and food conglomerates such as RJR Nabisco, now known as Mondelez International (MDLZ).\n\nIcahn doesn\u2019t shy away from a fight. He invested in nutritional supplement maker Herbalife (HLF) even though a rival billionaire investor, Bill Ackman, had declared the company a fraud and took a short position in Herbalife shares (a bet that would pay off if the share price declines). According to Herbalife, Icahn is currently the company\u2019s biggest shareholder.\n\nIcahn also has made his share of blunders, such as his investment in the now-defunct video-rental chain Blockbuster, which he described as his worst move ever. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe is the smartest guy that I have ever met,\u201d said Mark Stevens, author of the 1993 biography \u201cKing Icahn: Portrait of a Renegade Capitalist.\u201d\u00a0\u201cHe is very analytical, obviously, from what he\u2019s done,\u201d said Stevens, \u201cso he\u2019s ideal for analyzing what needs to be done with the regulatory environment.\u201d\n\nOfficials from both parties have lamented the growth of the federal bureaucracy for decades and have often promised to fix overly burdensome regulations. The Competitive Enterprise Institute noted that the Federal Register, where proposed and final rules are published, has hit 91,642 pages, the most in its 81-year history.\n\n\u201cA lot of them are silly, but most of them don\u2019t cost anything,\u201d said Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic Policy and Research, adding that he\u2019s worried that Icahn\u2019s inclinations wouldn\u2019t necessarily be for the \u201cpublic good.\u201d\n\nDuring his many boardroom battles, Icahn often argues that he\u2019s working in the best interest of all shareholders. Stevens and others, though, have countered for years that the Brooklyn, New York, native is interested only in himself and that his strong suit is agitating for change rather than operating companies.\n\n\u201cCarl hates people [and] if you operate a company, you have to like people,\u201d said Stevens, who likened the billionaire to a guard dog who jumps on the neck of a CEO and doesn\u2019t let go.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Icahn argued that regulations impede economic growth. He also rejected criticisms that he wouldn\u2019t act in the best interest of taxpayers because of his many investments. He didn\u2019t respond to a phone message left at his office, and officials from the Trump transition team didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIcahn\u2019s many critics over the decades accuse him of focusing too much on short-term gains at the expense of long-term growth, a claim he rejects.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s widely disliked by corporate CEOs and long-term investors alike, and putting him in charge of regulatory rollbacks is almost certainly a guarantee of a race to the bottom -- which will hit working families in wages, savings, health, the environment and much more,\u201d wrote Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, in an email. \u00a0\n\nIcahn\u2019s influence on Mr. Trump already has been seen in important policy decisions such as the choice of Steve Mnuchin as Treasury secretary and his fellow billionaire Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department, according to The Wall Street Journal,\u00a0\n\nIcahn told the paper that \u201cwhat Trump is trying to achieve is to show business in a lot of this country they aren\u2019t going to be ruined by absurd regulations by bureaucrats.\u201d\n\nMajor news organizations often prepare obituaries for famous people like Icahn in advance. While performing such a task for Bloomberg News, Stevens was asked to reflect on Icahn\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cMy answer was, after I thought about it for a moment, is that he doesn\u2019t have a legacy,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cCarl never built a company.

Tracy Smith questions him about that -- and much more -- for our Sunday Profile:\u00a0\n\nYou might say that Dennis Quaid has been a bit overwhelmed lately.\n\nHe\u2019s made more than 70 movies, but few have caused an uproar like this one. \n\n\u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose\u201d is about the good dogs do for mankind. But all that sentiment took a backseat 10 days ago when a tape surfaced showing what looks like a dog being forced to do a pool stunt during filming.\n\nWhen asked his reaction from seeing the video, Quaid said, \u201cI was really shocked, to tell you the truth, when I first saw it. And I didn\u2019t like what I saw. But I do know my own experience, when I was on the set, how much care was paid to each and every dog, or every other animal.\u201d\n\nQuaid, who is a dog owner in real life, wasn\u2019t in the water scene and had nothing to do with that part of the production.\n\n\u201cSo for people who are saying boycott the film, what would you say?\u201d Smith asked. \n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s fair, to tell you the truth. And I would never be on a set where dogs were mistreated or abused. I\u2019m getting a little verklempt talking about it. Because it hits me. Dogs hit us in a certain place. You sleep with your dog. You watch TV with them. You take \u2018em out in the car. And dogs, I think what they do for us, too, is they remind us of just the wonderful feeling of being alive. Simple as that.\u201d\n\nAt 62, the man who spent half of his life in Hollywood still keeps a place in the Texas hill country of Austin (\u201cYeah, I am a Texan at heart\u201d).\n\nHe\u2019s also a rock star at heart. On weekend nights, like this past Friday, he plays local clubs with his band, Dennis Quaid & the Sharks.\n\n\u201cIs that a hobby?\u201d Smith asked, \u201cOr is it a need? Do you need music?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a need,\u201d he replied. \n\nHe\u2019s not bad with a guitar. But acting has always paid the bills.\n\nDennis Quaid has created some of the most memorable characters on film, from the charmingly crooked cop in \u201cThe Big Easy,\u201d to a rail-thin Doc Holliday in \u201cWyatt Earp.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Houston, Quaid thought about becoming a veterinarian. But acting was always in his blood.\n\n\u201cMy dad was a frustrated actor,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my dad really introduced my brother and I both to acting through the movies.\u201d\n\nBig brother Randy got off to a fast start, making his debut in 1971\u2019s \u201cThe Last Picture Show,\u201d and earning an Oscar nomination for his work in 1973\u2019s \u201cThe Last Detail.\u201d\n\nBut Dennis had a few years of failed auditions before he finally found work.\n\nSmith asked, \u201cA lot of the guys that you started out with have fallen off the radar, and you have endured. Why do you think that is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a lot of tenacity, is what it is,\u201d Quaid said. \u201cAnd then I have an overwhelming capacity for rejection and failure! Fear of failure\u2019s a great motivator. It keeps you going.\u201d\n\nBy 1979 he\u2019d found his footing in films like \u201cBreaking Away,\u201d and then in \u201cThe Long Riders,\u201d in which the Quaid brothers worked together.\n\nDennis\u2019 favorite film? \u201c\u2019The Right Stuff.\u2019 Just \u2018cause I judge my movies not necessarily by how much money they did or even how good they were or turned out, but how the experience I had when I was making them. And with \u2018The Right Stuff\u2019 I had everything. It\u2019s a great film.\u201d\n\nQuaid played his boyhood hero, astronaut Gordon \u201cGordo\u201d Cooper. \u201cI loved the name Gordo. And I said, \u2018If they ever make a movie about this, man, I wanna play Gordo so bad!\u2019 And it was like one of those times in life where, you know, somebody wants it so bad, and it actually happens.\u201d\n\nQuaid met his second wife, Meg Ryan, on the set of 1987\u2019s \u201cInnerspace.\u201d\n\nHe was working hard, and partying harder. \n\nQuaid said, \u201cThe cocaine days were fun. Yeah, because cocaine, but it was, like, it\u2019s fun. That it\u2019s fun with problems. And then it\u2019s just problems. So it had gotten to the problem stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor you, how bad did it get?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was doing like two grams a day. You know, it was enough, and I was getting, like, an hour sleep a night.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a lot of sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a lot!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were with Meg Ryan at the time? How much did she help you to kick the addiction?\u201d Smith asked. \n\n\u201cYeah, she was fantastic. She was so supportive. And in fact, she didn\u2019t even know about [how] I was addicted at the time.\u201d\n\nHow did he hide it from her? \u201cWell, addicts are really good at hiding things.\u201d\n\nSince then he\u2019s been a clean and reliable box office star who\u2019s been known to stir up Oscar talk now and again.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t, I can\u2019t pay attention to it,\u201d he said. \u201cSure, it\u2019s nice to win awards and all that. It\u2019s nice that people recognize what you do or whatever. That\u2019s nice. But it\u2019s not the be-all or the end-all. So says the guy who doesn\u2019t have an Oscar!\u201d\n\nOscar or not, he\u2019s the first to admit how lucky he\u2019s been.\n\nIn 2007 Quaid and Kimberly Buffington nearly lost their newborn twins when hospital staff gave them an overdose of blood thinners. Miraculously, the babies survived.\n\n\u201cYou appreciate life when you go through something like that,\u201d Quaid said. \u201cGood thing we had a happy ending, that\u2019s really what I say. Thank God we had a happy ending.\u201d\n\nThe twins, Thomas and Zoe, were at a family party in Austin last night to honor their grandmother, Juanita, on her 90th birthday.\n\nQuaid calls her his rock, and says she taught him to get through the dark times by keeping his eyes on the light ahead.\n\nSmith asked, \u201cAre you optimistic?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Yeah, I am. Naturally, I am. I have my moments, but you know, naturally I think I\u2019ve been kind of optimistic. I think better things are always gonna come.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they usually do?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you hang around long enough!\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For more info:", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.78236401081085, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 926, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 8, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.38798646119, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170129160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.7278617710583202, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/as-bond-market-sputters-what-should-investors-do/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [771, 1172, 1548, 1832, 1878, 1879, 1915, 2318, 2978, 3418, 3734, 3852, 4004, 4547, 4837, 5082, 5371, 5530, 5903, 6055, 6293, 6618]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1078, "scraper_regex": 1163}}, "headline": "As bond market sputters, what should investors do?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1163, "date": "20161230110000", "story_content": "Bond investors have had a long successful ride. Now, though, with interest rates on the rise, that appears to be coming to an end. But is the bond bull market, which began in 1982, really dead meat? And going forward, how should you invest in bonds?\n\nThe long rally was touched off after the Federal Reserve\u2019s chairman at the time, Paul Volcker, started racheting up short-term interest rates in the late 1970s to combat double-digit inflation that had the U.S. economy in a stranglehold. By 1982, Volcker had succeeded in defeating inflation, and bond prices soared -- the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has more than tripled in price since then. Add in interest payments, and investors in those notes scored a bonanza.\u00a0\n\nInterest rates on bonds move in the opposite direction from bond prices. That\u2019s why investors did so well as the 10-year Treasury, which yielded almost 16 percent at the end of 1981, tumbled all the way down to 1.4 percent in July 2016. Lately, after the Fed\u2019s second quarter-percentage-point increase in a year, the T-note has climbed to 2.5 percent, which translates to a 9 percent price decline.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMore pain is coming,\u201d warned Al Martinez, a managing director at investment firm High Tower Boca Raton in Florida. He predicted that the 10-year Treasury will yield 3 percent in early 2017.\n\nThe Fed wants to hike rates three more times in 2017, amid a slight uptick in inflation and to restore rates to their historical level now that the economy seems to be doing better.\u00a0\n\nFor that and other reasons, the 35-year bond bull market is over, according to a number of savants. To Peter Boockvar, the chief market analyst for Lindsey Group, a Washington, D.C., advisory firm, it\u2019s high time \u201cto call the bottom in global interest rates and the top in prices.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s what investors should consider now: \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhy the bond market is important.\u00a0The fate of the bond market should concern every investor, and not just because a seeming growth vehicle is losing its horsepower. Classically, bonds function as the ballast to a portfolio. During the past 10 years, the S&P 500 (the standard stock benchmark) and the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index have each climbed about 60 percent, but the bond index\u2019s ascent has been much more smooth.\u00a0\n\nBecause stocks are much more volatile than bonds, investing in the S&P 500 has been a storm-tossed passage. The stock index lost almost half its value during the 2008-09 financial crisis, before recovering and hitting new highs. The traditional investing advice is to keep a 60-40 stock-bond balance, so the steadier fixed-income category can help cushion stock gyrations.\n\nAnd since buying individual bonds is an expensive proposition for ordinary investors -- thanks to broker commissions and unfavorable spreads between bid and asked prices -- financial advisers tend to recommend using bond mutual funds or exchange-traded funds instead.\n\nOnly a hiccup?\u00a0It can be argued, however, that the current pummeling of bonds is merely a hiccup, and the bull run will continue, perhaps in a more restrained fashion. When that will occur is uncertain. Humberto Garcia, chairman of Leumi Investment Services\u2019 investment committee, wrote in a research report that \u201cthe immediate hit to fixed income valuations is likely to hold\u201d until Washington policy questions, like reducing regulations, are resolved. \u00a0\n\nThe last big hiccup, which roiled the bond market mightily, was in 1994. Alan Greenspan, who succeeded Volcker at the Fed, feared that an expanding economy would increase the tempo of inflation. So he set about boosting short-term rates to 5.5 percent from 3 percent, the first tightening of credit in five years.\u00a0\n\nThe bond market plunged: The 10-year Treasury saw yields increase to 7.3 percent from 5.6 percent in three months. \u00a0\n\nAt the same time, the stock market also slid, something that seldom happens during a bond rout. The S&P 500 dropped 7 percent during the same period.\u00a0\n\nThis showed that, in 1994 at least, investors were spooked that more expensive borrowing costs would harm corporate earnings. The effect was temporary, though, as both stock and bond markets recovered and the 1990s boom kept going.\n\nYet in late 2016, markets are behaving more normally. Stocks have done well, setting new records, while bonds have sagged. What\u2019s more significant, bond bulls think today\u2019s world demands that rates stay, in the phrase popular on Wall Street, \u201clower for longer.\u201d If that happens, any bond rout will be muted.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s encouraging that the present Fed wants to raise rates using \u201ca systematic, methodical approach,\u201d said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management in Monument, Colorado. He noted that rates still are on the low side, historically. \u201cAnd they won\u2019t skyrocket.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHow to invest. With rates nosing upward, many advisers recommend a barbell strategy, in which you pair shorter-term bond funds (which suffer less when rates rise) with longer-maturity ones that will recover eventually and offer better yields.\u00a0\n\nAmong the latter, \u201cjunk bonds\u201d -- those with less-than-stellar credit ratings -- have held up pretty well since Donald Trump\u2019s election. That\u2019s likely because junk tends to track the stock market, and the economy seems sufficiently robust that the risks of default for the bonds is low.\u00a0\n\nSarah Bush, director of manager research for fixed-income at Morningstar, noted that junk is the top-performing bond fund category this year, up 13 percent.\u00a0\n\nWhile inflation remains muted, it does appear to be on the upswing to a degree. That\u2019s why Collin Martin, director for fixed income at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, has recommended Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, which have a built-in escalation mechanism to keep the bonds\u2019 value abreast of inflation, the bane of fixed-income investments.\u00a0\n\nIn the past, low inflation made them also-rans whose prices dipped as a result. So right now, he contended, \u201cthey are priced at an attractive level.\u201d\u00a0\n\nOne sector to be more wary about, Morningstar\u2019s Bush warned, is municipal bonds, which benefit from being tax-free. If Mr. Trump succeeds in lowering federal taxes, she noted, their appeal will sag and their returns will be lackluster.\u00a0\n\nAnd of course, you can always turn to so-called \u201cbond-equivalents.\u201d Chief among them are real estate investment trusts (REITs), which generally are pools of property that pay nice dividends drawn from tenants\u2019 rent payments.

The heavy rains forced rivers out of their banks and toppled trees, among them the famed \u201cPioneer Cabin\u201d in Calaveras Big Trees State Park that had a drive-thru tunnel carved into its base more than a century ago.\n\nAnother strong storm bearing down on the region was expected to hit Tuesday.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a high-wind warning for much of the Sacramento Valley for Tuesday, with wind gusts as high as 50 to 60 miles per hour, reports CBS Sacramento.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is saturated soils, high winds and it\u2019s a bad mixture for the trees,\u201d arborist James Speck told the station.\n\nEmergency crews in rescue boats and helicopters took advantage of the one-day respite from the rains later Monday to rescue stranded people and assess damage after a weekend of stormy weather that authorities called the heaviest rain in a decade.\n\nIn the Sierra Nevada mountains, a winter storm warning was in effect until Thursday morning with the potential for blizzard and white-out conditions, said Scott McGuire, a forecaster for the National Weather Service based in Reno, Nevada.\n\nFour to 8 feet of snow are forecast through Thursday above 7,000 feet, and the Lake Tahoe area could get between 2 to 5 feet of snow, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople need to avoid traveling if at all possible,\u201d said McGuire. Avalanche concerns kept some California ski areas closed for a second day Monday in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, a coastal flood advisory was in effect from Tuesday through Friday, with a forecast for up to 7-foot \u201cking tides\u201d that could pose a flooding risk for coastal roadways, said Steve Anderson, a National Weather Service forecaster in Monterey, California.\n\nFlood warnings and a high-wind watch was also in effect Tuesday for the Russian River, which rose to its highest level since 2006 and spilled over its banks early Monday, flooding roads and vineyards and forcing schools to close across the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been about 10 years since we\u2019ve experienced this kind of rainfall,\u201d Anderson said Monday. He said the storm system arriving Tuesday was not as potent as over weekend but could still cause problems. \u201cThe big concern is flash flooding, rapid rises on creeks and the Russian River coming out of its banks again.\u201d\n\nParts of California\u2019s wine country in Sonoma County were among the hardest hit, with up to 13 inches of rain from Friday-early Monday. Rolling hills and vineyards along the scenic route known as River Road were submerged Monday with just the tips of the vines visible in completely flooded fields.\n\nMelba Martinelli, who lives in the Russian River town of Guerneville, was wading through her yard Monday in knee-high rain boots, surrounded by flooded streets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m watching the water come up higher and higher, and my boots are almost going underwater now,\u201d Martinelli said. \u201cThe river is coming up the street now. It\u2019s pretty scary.\u201d\n\nIn nearby Forestville, rescuers launched rafts and used a helicopter to search for people cut off by rising water. Authorities said the mostly dry conditions Monday were a relief.\n\nSuch gaps between storms are \u201cwhat saves us from the big water,\u201d Forestville Fire Chief Max Ming said. \u201cPeople hunker down and wait for it to get past.\u201d\n\nTo the south near Los Angeles, commuters were warned of possible highway flooding and mudslides in hilly areas.\n\nThe back-to-back storms that hit California and Nevada since last week are part of an \u201catmospheric river\u201d weather system that draws precipitation from the Pacific Ocean as far west as Hawaii. That kind of system, also known as the \u201cpineapple express,\u201d poses catastrophic risks for areas hit by the heaviest rain.\n\nDespite the bad weather in some parts, Yosemite National Park was forecasting a return to normal. The park planned to reopen the valley floor to visitors Tuesday morning after it was closed through the weekend and Monday because of a storm-swollen river, park spokesman Scott Gediman said. He said guests will be allowed back in starting at 8 a.m. for day visitors. Park workers were checking the extent of damage from the storm to water and sewer systems, he said.\n\nSacramento River levels swelled so much that state officials planned to open the weir located upstream from Sacramento\u2019s Tower Bridge for the first time in more than a decade. The weir is a barrier of 48 gates that must be opened manually to protect the city of Sacramento from floodwaters.\n\nEmergency workers in Nevada voluntarily evacuated about 1,300 people from 400 homes in a Reno neighborhood as the Truckee River overflowed and drainage ditches backed up.\n\nSchools were canceled Monday in Reno and Sparks, and Gov. Brian Sandoval told all nonessential state government workers to stay home Monday after he declared a state of emergency.\n\nAfter touring the two cities, Sandoval said no serious injuries were reported during the flooding, which authorities had feared might be the worst in a decade.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet because it wasn\u2019t as bad as it could have been,\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cBut to those people affected, it was really hard on them.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 29, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.77731084823608, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 922, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 8.16159115908, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 29, "mft_sum": 39, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.22993492407809, "mft_mean": 3.54545454545}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-seniors-student-debt-eats-into-social-security/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [229, 997, 1247, 1861, 2088, 2475, 2670, 3100, 3608, 3865, 4262]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 712, "scraper_regex": 753}}, "headline": "For many seniors, student debt eats into Social Security", "wordcount_as_scraped": 753, "date": "20161221110000", "story_content": "College loans are often thought of as a financial roadblock for millennials, but there\u2019s another group for whom student debt may be even more of a headache: older Americans.\u00a0\n\nPeople over the age of 50 are the fastest-growing group with student debt, even outpacing younger generations, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office. As a result, over the last decade student debt loads for Americans ages 50 to 64 have more than quadrupled, soaring from $43 billion to $183 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s painting an increasingly dire picture for older Americans with student debt. While juggling repayment and daily bills are never easy, borrowers over the age of 50 don\u2019t have the decades of earning potential ahead of them that younger people do. The strain may be even greater because federal law allows the government to garnish the Social Security benefits of borrowers over the age of 50 who have defaulted on their school loans.\u00a0\n\nIn 2015 alone, the government took $171 million in Social Security payments from older Americans who defaulted on student loans, the study found. That contributed to pushing tens of thousands of seniors below the poverty line, the report suggests.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis report shows us that seniors clearly aren\u2019t immune to the student loan crisis -- they\u2019re deeply impacted by this issue to the point that it\u2019s leaving many of them in a dire financial situation,\u201d Senator Claire McCaskill, D.-Missouri, said in a statement. \u201cWe could have hundreds of thousands of American seniors living in poverty due to garnished Social Security benefits if this trend continues, and we shouldn\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d\n\nThe number of seniors whose Social Security benefits have been garnished and who are living below the poverty line has swelled from 8,300 a decade ago to 67,300 today.\u00a0\n\nAlmost four of 10 borrowers over the age of 65 are in default on their student loans, the largest share out of any age group, the study found. By comparison, fewer than two of 10 Americans under the age of 50 are in default.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe hard-earned Social Security checks that are the sole source of income for millions of seniors should not be siphoned off to pay interest and fees on student loan debt,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren. D.-Massachusetts, in a statement. She and McCaskill asked the GAO to provide information about how Social Security garnishment impacts seniors, and how long the garnishment lasts.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, many older Americans die while still owing money on their student loans. About 13 percent of Americans over the age of 50 pass away while still holding outstanding college debt.\u00a0\n\nSo why are so many older Americans increasingly mired in student debt? They are typically people who took out their loans during their mid-career years. About six of 10 took out their loans while in their 30s and 40s, which underscores the difficulty of taking on thousands in college debt while hitting one\u2019s prime working years. That is typically when people are hitting milestones, such as raising families and buying homes.\u00a0\n\nOlder Americans are also increasingly holding low-wage jobs, according to research published earlier this year by Teresa Ghilarducci, professor of economics at The New School for Social Research. She found that slightly more than 27 percent of full-time workers over 55 years old held low-paying jobs in September, compared with 19 percent of younger workers. In some cases, older workers lose their middle-income jobs and are forced to accept lower-paying work in retail or health care to make ends meet.\u00a0\n\nThe older borrowers who have their Social Security benefits garnished tend to owe less than $10,000, which suggests they may be struggling to make ends meet. The typical amount taken out of seniors\u2019 Social Security checks was about $140, the study found.\u00a0\n\nAlthough the agency isn\u2019t allowed to withhold more than 15 percent of a senior\u2019s monthly check, the garnishment threshold hasn\u2019t been adjusted to reflect the rising cost of living. At the time it was first set, the threshold was above the poverty guideline, but now has fallen below it, the GAO said.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of seniors burdened by student debt is likely to rise, the GAO warned.\u00a0\n\nFixing the issue will require lawmakers to adjust Social Security\u2019s garnishment provisions to reflect the higher cost of living. It also recommended that the Department of Education provide a clearer process for discharging debt for those with disabilities, with the GAO saying the documentation rules \u201care not clearly and prominently stated.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.83870959281921, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 712, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.32368070931, "HarmVirtue": 15, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.80898876404494, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-democrats-to-elect-new-leader-wednesday/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [702, 940, 1130, 1219, 1260, 1295, 1358, 1392, 1421, 1450, 1479, 1517, 1543, 1572, 1614, 1644, 1677, 1716, 1758, 1785, 1812, 1847, 1873]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 630, "scraper_regex": 865}}, "headline": "Senate Democrats elect Chuck Schumer as their new leader", "wordcount_as_scraped": 865, "date": "20161116150000", "story_content": "Last Updated Nov 16, 2016 10:30 AM EST\n\nWASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats are turning to Sen.

Democrats postponed their leadership election until Nov. 30 after junior lawmakers demanded more time to digest the party\u2019s disappointing Election Day showing, a warning shot at House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nMcConnell opened the Senate\u2019s first session of the lame-duck Congress calling for unity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not Democrats first. We\u2019re not Republicans first. We are Americans first,\u201d said McConnell, who early in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency said his goal was to limit him to one term.\n\nSchumer, 65, has been No. 3 Senate Democratic leader and is a confidante of Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., departing after a three-decade career in the chamber. Schumer has a history of being a savvy partisan combatant willing to strike compromises, such as on a 2013 bipartisan immigration overhaul that ended up dying.\n\nSchumer is vaulting past No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Dick Durbin of Illinois and will lead Democrats\u2019 last line of defense against the Trump White House and GOP-controlled House. Senate Democrats - outnumbered 52-48, including two independents who back Democrats - could prevent McConnell from getting the 60 votes he\u2019ll need on some important issues.\n\nSchumer has said he\u2019ll seek opportunities to work with Trump but will face pressure from disappointed Democratic activists to adopt a hard line. It\u2019s unclear how he\u2019ll balance the demands of progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., against red-state senators facing re-election in 2018 and needing protection from politically damaging votes.\n\nMcConnell, 74, was Senate minority leader for eight years before the GOP took control of the chamber for 2015 and 2016. He\u2019s widely backed among Republicans.\n\nHe\u2019s pushed a conservative agenda while cutting budget deals with the Obama administration, and boldly refused to let the Senate consider Obama\u2019s nomination of federal judge Merrick Garland to fill a Supreme Court vacancy that occurred last February. That move paid dividends when Trump was elected.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Republicans re-nominated Ryan by unanimous voice vote.\n\nRyan will need 218 votes - a majority - to be approved when the full, new House convenes Jan. 3. With the GOP on target to have 241 seats next year, Ryan can afford just 23 defectors, but many Republicans expect Ryan to be safe in the GOP afterglow of Trump\u2019s win.\n\nAiding Ryan: Support from Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, which Ryan and others underscored to Republican lawmakers before they voted.\n\n\u201cThe momentum is with us,\u201d Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., said in an interview after nominating Ryan during Tuesday\u2019s closed-door meeting. \u201cThe last thing we need is to distract attention right now with a leadership fight. We\u2019re all pulling in the same direction.\u201d\n\nMulvaney is in the tea party-leaning House Freedom Caucus, which has frequently rebelled against GOP leaders.\n\nFreedom Caucus leader Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said that while he expected Ryan to be elected speaker, \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d during the lame-duck session with Ryan\u2019s handling of spending bills and rules giving rank-and-file lawmakers more power.\n\nAt a meeting of House Democrats Tuesday, Pelosi told her colleagues \u201cwe\u2019ve been through hell\u201d with the election and that Democrats should draw contrasts with Trump, according to an aide in the room.\n\nBut all were not happy.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s not good.

But many question whether it is possible to reverse the campaign\u2019s damage to political discourse and its ripples out to the way Americans speak to and about each other.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of blame to go around on this subject, but I think in this particular election that an embrace of Donald Trump was an embrace of incivility and vulgarity and insults and bullying, and unfortunately we saw very little public repudiation of that from any Trump supporters,\u201d said Mark DeMoss, an Atlanta public relations executive and conservative Republican whose clients are mostly Christian religious organizations.\n\nDeMoss, who abandoned a campaign called the Civility Project in early 2011 after only three members of Congress would sign a pledge to act respectfully, watched the degradation of political speech for years. Then Trump\u2019s campaign, he and other longtime observers say, stomped well past what was thought to be acceptable.\n\n\u201cWe can all point to incidents in campaigns across history, but I think this one probably does represent a new place in terms of incivility,\u201d said James Mullen, president of Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, which awards a prize each year for civility in public life.\n\n\u201cWhat worries me the most is we\u2019re becoming almost numb,\u201d Mullen said.\n\nWhen Allegheny - which first polled Americans about political civility in 2010 - did so again in October, researchers noted a \u201cdisturbing\u201d decline in those rejecting insults in politics. The number who disapprove of political comments about someone\u2019s race or ethnicity declined from 89 percent to 69 percent. The number who said it was unacceptable to shout over a debate opponent fell from 86 percent to 65 percent.\n\nMany observers blame Trump, who called Mexican immigrants \u201crapists,\u201d tarred his adversaries as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d and \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and complained that a TV journalist\u2019s dogged questioning was just a sign she had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever.\u201d He said all of those things, not on long-forgotten tapes, but in front of millions of voters.\n\nAt Trump\u2019s rallies, supporters followed suit, chanting \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d about Clinton and wearing T-shirts with the slogan, \u201cTrump That Bitch!\u201d\n\nNearly 2,000 teachers surveyed by the Southern Poverty Law Center this spring reported that the campaign\u2019s scorching words were having a \u201cprofoundly negative impact\u201d on their students. More than half said they had seen an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose race, religion or nationality had been targeted by political rhetoric.\n\nThe survey did not identify any candidates. But teachers singled out Trump in more than 1,000 comments, while fewer than 200 combined named Clinton, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nIn recent years, teachers mindful of bullying and taunts on social media have worked to make schools places of mutual respect, said Maureen Costello, director of the SPLC\u2019s Teaching Tolerance project.\n\n\u201cWhat made this year really different is that it broke through that protective moat,\u201d Costello said. The political rhetoric was \u201cso ubiquitous and so saturated the culture that you couldn\u2019t keep it out of schools. Kids are sponges.\u201d\n\nWhen Beth Ferris, a middle school teacher in Yucca Valley, California, told students on Election Day that history would be made one way or the other, one of her students said, \u201cYeah, she (Clinton) should be in jail!\u201d At a nearby high school, vandals painted \u201cTrump 2016,\u201d on a wall and covered the word \u201cGirls\u201d on a bathroom door with a vulgarity.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d Ferris said.\n\nOn the day after the election, teacher Dee Burek said fifth and sixth graders in her Allentown, New Jersey, middle school asked how Trump had become the Republican nominee. She recalled his insults of opponents in debates and how they stuck.\n\n\u201cThe kids just kind of looked at me and said, \u2018But that doesn\u2019t make any sense. That\u2019s bullying,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf these middle schoolers can see that, I think there\u2019s hope.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.35729837417603, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1273, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.67099366497, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161113150000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.5923016496465, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/vw-execs-arrest-slowdown-white-collar-prosecutions/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [771, 1750, 3008, 3435, 3883, 5135, 5567, 5808, 5981, 6563, 6750, 8306, 8415]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1216, "scraper_regex": 1321}}, "headline": "VW highlights how few top execs get prosecuted", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1321, "date": "20170111150000", "story_content": "The mid-level Volkswagen executive who allegedly helped cover up the German automaker\u2019s emissions fraud got nabbed by federal agents this week. But the FBI\u2019s arrest of Oliver Schmidt underscores an uncomfortable truth about white-collar prosecutions nowadays: There are fewer of them, and big shots rarely get put in the pokey.\n\nOver the past 10 years through 2016, federal prosecutions of white-collar crimes have dropped 21 percent, to 9,532 last year, according to Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, which researches federal law enforcement. Many of them were garden-variety offenses such as credit card fraud, not misdeeds of large entities like Volkswagen or huge financial firms.\u00a0\n\nWhen contacted, the Justice Department declined to comment other than to say the falloff isn\u2019t as severe at the TRAC data show. By Justice\u2019s tally, for the 10-year period ending in 2015, white-collar prosecutions have dipped 9 percent.\n\nIn Volkswagen\u2019s case, \u201cisn\u2019t it interesting they are going against foreigners, not American financial elites?\u201d said William K. Black, an economics and law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Black was a banking regulator during the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s. What\u2019s more, Schmidt is nowhere near being one of the car company\u2019s top dogs.\n\nCritics like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, have complained that no high-ranking Wall Streeters were charged for their role in the 2008-09 financial meltdown. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a 10-member body created by President Barack Obama and Congress, fingered nine financial pros it felt warranted prosecuting -- but nothing happened.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot one of the nine has gone to prison or been convicted of a criminal offense,\u201d Warren wrote last fall in a letter to the Justice Department.\n\nInstead, the government has elicited fines from large institutions implicated in the housing crisis and other business imbroglios. Prosecutors, for instance, declined to file criminal charges against Angelo Mozilo, head of Countrywide Financial, a major subprime lender that ended up getting bought by Bank of America (BAC). The company paid Mozilo more than $400 million from 2001 through 2006.\n\nMozilo publicly touted the dubious mortgages he issued and privately disparaged their quality, regulators said. Although accused in a Securities and Exchange Commission civil action of securities fraud, Mozilo got off with paying a $67 million fine, and his old employer (through BofA) picked up a third of the tab.\n\nWith Volkswagen, the harm was to the environment, not gullible investors who bought toxic Countrywide/Bank of America mortgages packaged into bonds, or the not-creditworthy homeowners who took out the loans but lost their homes in foreclosures. Federal officials have said VW engineers rigged diesel vehicles to emit less pollution during testing, but out on the road the exhaust was far dirtier.\u00a0\n\nCharged on Monday with defrauding the U.S. government and consumers, Schmidt oversaw U.S. emissions compliance when he was based in Michigan. He moved back to VW headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, in 2015, where he helped orchestrate a campaign to mislead American authorities, the federal complaint said. He allegedly briefed top company executives -- not named in the complaint -- about the cover-up measures in mid-2015.\u00a0\n\nThe FBI picked up Schmidt at Miami\u2019s airport as he was set to return from vacation to Germany. There\u2019s speculation that federal officials might pressure him to rat out superiors. But the U.S. and Germany don\u2019t have an extradition agreement. VW has agreed to pay more than $17 billion to settle civil claims in the emissions-rigging scandal. Another deal is pending that may force it to pay up to $4.3 billion to settle criminal and other claims.\u00a0\n\nThe sole VW corner-suite casualty thus far is Martin Winterkorn, VW\u2019s former CEO who resigned in September after U.S. regulators accused the automaker of manipulating the emissions tests. German authorities are investigating to see if he and another executive violated securities laws.\n\nMeanwhile, few doubt that the ground has shifted in terms of U.S. prosecutors\u2019 zeal to take on business offenses.The contrast is vivid between today and the federal crackdown on S&L leaders in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Then, some 800 bank officials went to prison, most prominently Charles Keating, who served four years. His Lincoln Savings and Loan convinced customers to trade in federally insured certificates of deposit for rickety bonds that the S&L issued through its parent.\n\nSome blame the lighter touch toward business and financial regulation that began under President Bill Clinton and continued under President George W. Bush. That may be simplistic because Mr. Bush\u2019s administration came down hard on corporate miscreants at Enron and others at the start of his tenure.\n\nUnder Mr. Obama, the reluctance may have stemmed from not wanting to undermine the nation\u2019s banking industry as it repaired itself in the aftermath of the Great Recession.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s main accomplishment was extracting $200 billion in civil fines and penalties from a variety of financial institutions in exchange for releasing them from the threat of future prosecutions,\u201d lamented author William Cohan, a former Wall Street banker turned skeptic in a New York Times op-ed piece. The outgoing president focused his energies on imposing more stringent regulation with the Dodd-Frank law.\u00a0\n\nThe landscape may be different soon. Candidate Donald Trump blasted Mr. Obama -- and opponent Hillary Clinton -- for coddling Wall Street. But the president-elect may now be signaling that no tough new sanctions are imminent, in light of \u00a0his anti-regulatory thinking and Cabinet preferences that include financiers such as former Goldman Sachs (GS) banker Steve Mnuchin, who is slated to be Treasury secretary.\u00a0\n\nRight now, the playbook for federal prosecutors on business offenses is:\n\nTop executives of high-profile companies get a pass, especially Wall Street ones. No senior bank executives went to the clink after the demise of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, or for the serious fraud in mortgage issuance. Yes, those who faced federal wrath were people like VW\u2019s Schmidt and Credit Suisse\u2019s Kareem Serageldin, its chief of structured credit, who was sentenced to 30 months for inflating the value of his portfolio\u2019s mortgage bonds. But they were hardly at the apex of their companies.\u00a0\n\nAnd unless a case is a slam-dunk, the Justice Department is reluctant to engage in prolonged litigation. Criminal charges against a chief executive officer would fall into that bucket.\u00a0\n\nLast year, Mr. Obama\u2019s former Attorney General Eric Holder told onetime Obama aide David Axelrod on his podcast that \u201cwe have a responsibility in the Justice Department to only bring those cases where we think we have a better than 50 percent chance of winning.\u201d\n\nLarge corporations can throw enormous resources into a legal fight, hiring hundreds of lawyer to overwhelm the government\u2019s legal teams, said Eugene Soltes, a Harvard Business School professor. \u201cYou can see why Justice would be gun-shy,\u201d he noted.\n\nException to the too-big-to-jail rule: If the offense is egregious and the public harm is tangible. Volkswagen falls into this category. So did Enron, which cooked its books and disguised enormous debts that brought the company crashing down in 2001, dealing a blow to investors and employees who held what became its worthless stock. Founder Kenneth Lay and CEO Jeff Skilling were convicted of fraud and other crimes. Lay died before his prison term started, and Skilling will be behind bars until 2019.\n\nBut the small-fry can burn. A lot of federal white-collar prosecutions are of individual doctors who cheat Medicaid, said the University of Missouri-Kansas City\u2019s Black. Medical device and food safety problems result in small-ish companies and their leaders getting slammed by Washington\u2019s might. Last summer, an appellate court upheld the convictions of two brothers, Austin and Peter DeCoster, whose commercial farm in Iowa shipped salmonella-tainted eggs, which sickened thousands of people. They\u2019re due to serve three-month terms.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps if the DeCoster brothers had gotten top jobs at Lehman Brothers, things would have been different.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.896551609039309, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1216, "FairnessVirtue": 7, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 2, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.1648900337299994, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.96052631578947, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-may-reverse-obama-environment-initiatives/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [747]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 906, "scraper_regex": 953}}, "headline": "Trump likely to take aim at Obama environment initiatives", "wordcount_as_scraped": 953, "date": "20161111160000", "story_content": "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump has not minced words about his approach to environment and energy policy: He loathes regulation and wants to increase the use of coal, offshore drilling and fracking.\n\nTrump has said he believes climate change is a hoax and that he would \u201ccancel\u201d U.S. involvement in the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming.\n\nWhile he\u2019s been vague about precise policies, Trump\u2019s election likely means trouble for some of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature environmental initiatives, environmentalists and policy analysts say.\n\nIn a signal of how he plans to approach the issue as president, Trump has selected a skeptic of climate change to lead his\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency transition team.\n\nMyron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute\u2019s (CEI) is also viewed by many as a top candidate to become the next head of the EPA. Ebell\u2019s research focuses on questioning what he calls \u201cglobal warming alarmism\u201d and opposing energy rationing policies, according to his biography on CEI\u2019s website.\n\nAnalysts say it\u2019s probable that Trump\u2019s administration will seek to weaken or kill the Clean Power Plan, a cornerstone Obama policy meant to reduce carbon pollution from the nation\u2019s power plants as part of an effort to combat climate change.\n\nThe Clean Power Plan is being challenged in federal court, and if it survives, Trump could move to scuttle it. But not without a fight.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t consider the CPP dead. We have many tools to help preserve it,\u201d said David Goldston, director of government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cHe can\u2019t just snap his fingers and wish away regulations. There\u2019d be a backlash, which would make Congress think twice.\u201d\n\nAny move to back out of the Clean Power Plan or the Paris Agreement could be extremely unpopular moves, environmentalists argue. Polls have shown a majority of voters in at least two states surveyed believe global warming is a serious problem.\n\nAn exit poll conducted for The Associated Press and television networks found that about half of Trump voters in Florida, a state he carried, agreed that climate change was a serious problem. In Maine, just over half of Trump supporters also agreed, while about four in 10 disagreed.\n\nTrump also has vowed to tap into America\u2019s coal reserves in an effort to put the shrinking energy sector back to work. In a speech in the Bakken shale fields of North Dakota, he also said he would increase hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in the nation\u2019s shale and natural gas reserves to further remove any dependence on foreign energy sources.\n\nIndustry advocates are buoyed by the possibilities presented by Trump\u2019s win.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with the new administration\u201d on issues such as opening more public land and offshore areas to oil and gas drilling, building more energy infrastructure and reducing environmental regulations, American Petroleum Institute President Jack Gerard said Thursday. He would not say whether he supported a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.\n\nLikewise, the coal industry believes Trump \u201cunderstands the urgent need to rein in the Washington bureaucracy and sweeping, excessive regulations\u201d to protect coal jobs in an industry where sharply falling demand for coal has led to permanent plant closures, the American Coal Council said.\n\n\u201cThe coal sector has been devastated by lower demand and job loss in recent years due to the mounting impact of regulations pointed squarely at our industry,\u201d American Coal Council CEO Betsy Monseu said.\n\nSome question whether it would make economic sense for the U.S. to attempt to increase the use of coal, a fuel being phased out of the energy picture due to its pollution and falling prices of renewables such as solar and wind.\n\n\u201cCoal is not coming back,\u201d said Michael Brune, Sierra Club executive director. \u201cAsk investors on Wall Street, or regulators at the state and local level who are choosing solar and wind because of basic economics.\u201d\n\nAs for offshore drilling, Trump could target the Atlantic and Arctic: two areas the Obama administration had made off-limits for oil leases in the immediate future. While the Obama administration has moved to restrict drilling in waters off the Eastern Seaboard and Alaska, Trump has been vague on whether he would support reopening these areas to drilling, saying he backs it when it \u201ccan be done responsibly.\u201d\n\nEnvironmentalists said Wednesday they hope Trump concludes opening the Atlantic and Arctic to offshore drilling is a bad business decision.\n\n\u201cIn the Atlantic, we hope he will recognize the strong opposition from the business community, which has mounted a concerted campaign to protect its fishing and tourism industries against the interest of the oil industry,\u201d said Jacqueline Savitz of Oceana, a group opposed to offshore drilling. \u201cIn the Arctic, it\u2019s impossible to respond to an oil spill, with extreme cold, floating ice, darkness much of the year and no response facilities.\u201d\n\nConcerns over the incoming administration\u2019s environmental approach were not confined to policy.\n\nSome climate scientists expressed concern that the Trump administration could reduce government\u2019s efforts to study climate change. For example, some Republicans have long wanted to stop NASA\u2019s role in studying earth science and climate change \u2014 a key contribution to scientific understanding of the issue that helps drive policy decisions.\n\nWaleed Abdalati, a former NASA chief scientist, said in an email that the agency\u2019s contributions are extremely important to the nation\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cPart of this investment includes trying to better understand how and why our environment is changing and the implications for the American people, as well as people all over the world,\u201d Abdalati wrote. \u201cNo one can argue that there is tremendous value in knowing what tomorrow will bring.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.5826447010040297, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 906, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.37410270131, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161111160000, "PurityVirtue": 4, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.42825607064018, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/as-breitbart-wages-war-on-kelloggs-advertisers-flee/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [291, 1016, 1198, 1748, 2645, 2846, 3301, 4022, 4147, 4435]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 728, "scraper_regex": 766}}, "headline": "As Breitbart wages \"war\" on Kellogg\u2019s, advertisers flee", "wordcount_as_scraped": 766, "date": "20161202140000", "story_content": "Breitbart News, an ultraconservative website that has served as a platform for the white nationalist \u201calt-right\u201d movement, is touting its growing readership and \u201cmain street American values\u201d as a reason advertisers should stick with it.\u00a0\n\nSome marketers, however, are heading for the exits, directing their advertising dollars away from Breitbart amid the publication\u2019s call for a boycott against Kellogg\u2019s (K), which has pulled its ads from the site. That prompted Breitbart to declare \u201cwar\u201d on Kellogg\u2019s: Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow said on the site that \u201cto blacklist Breitbart News in order to placate left-wing totalitarians is a disgraceful act of cowardice.\u201d\n\nBreitbart\u2019s campaign against Kellogg\u2019s is unusual on a number of fronts, not in the least because news organizations traditionally maintain a separation between their business operations and their editors and reporters so that journalists can operate independently from business interests.\u00a0\n\nAnd whether the boycott will help Breitbart financially appears questionable, given that attacking a major advertiser isn\u2019t likely to make the site more appealing to other brands.\u00a0\n\n\u201cReporters don\u2019t behave that way in the U.S., nor should they,\u201d said Lee Wilkins, professor and chair of the department of communications at Wayne State University, who\u2019s an expert in media ethics. \u201cMost journalistic organizations have checks between the people who pay for your news work and the news work itself, so that you are as a journalist protected from those influences.\u201d\n\nShe said she views Breitbart as a blog rather than a journalistic organization. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t a journalism organization, then those safeguards are never in place.\u201d \u00a0\n\nOther companies saying this week that they\u2019ll pull their ads from Breitbart include Vanguard, 3M (MMM) and AARP, among others.\n\nKellogg\u2019s said it decided to remove its advertising because Breitbart didn\u2019t align with its values. It said the decision has \u201cnothing to do with politics.\u201d Stephen Bannon, Breitbart\u2019s former chairman, served on President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and is now set to become one of the incoming president\u2019s top advisers in the White House.\n\nVanguard said it removed its ads as soon as it became aware that they were running on Breitbart. \u201cAs a policy, Vanguard does not advertise on any overtly political websites, including the site in question,\u201d a spokeswoman wrote in an email. She said the ads appeared as part of a \u201cremarketing\u201d program, which are ads that appear to clients and investors when they visit third-party websites because of their browsing history.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOur remarketing advertisements are limited to pre-approved sites (again, no political sites), however it was brought to our attention last week that this site was inadvertently included,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\nBreitbart\u2019s advertiser showdown comes as the anti-Trump campaign #GrabYourWallet is taking aim at the site, officially adding it to its own boycott list on Thursday. #GrabYourWallet was created before the election by Sue Atencio, a 59-year-old grandmother, and marketing specialist Shannon Coulter, as a way to express concerns about Trump\u2019s boasts of sexual assault. Since his victory, the boycott of stores that sell Trump brands has picked up steam.\u00a0\n\n\u201cBecause of the way digital advertising works, we\u2019re not yet adding companies that advertise on Bretibart to the boycott list,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them time to work with their media buyers and ad networks to ensure their ads no longer appear there.\u201d\n\nWhile Breitbart is billing Kellogg\u2019s decision as \u201cbigoted and anti-American,\u201d it\u2019s a well-established American business practice for corporations to shift their sponsorship to companies they believe will help bolster their brand. In the case of reaching conservative audiences, advertisers that exit Breitbart aren\u2019t necessarily snubbing those consumers because other conservative-leaning outlets, such as Fox News or Glenn Beck\u2019s The Blaze, have an overlap.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of places advertisers can go to reach the same audience, and even maybe a bigger audience,\u201d Wilkins said.\u00a0\n\nNevertheless, Breitbart has been buidling its readership in the past year.

The report said that those rounded up were suspected of \u201caiding and abetting\u201d the gunman.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Veysi Kaynak told Turkish news channel A Haber on Thursday that investigators believe the suspect is likely a Uighur. Officials have said they know the man\u2019s identity, but they have not made the name public.\n\nKaynak said authorities were close to catching the gunman, telling A Haber that \u201cthe circle is closing in\u201d on the suspect, who vanished after the attack.\n\nKaynak added that officials could not rule out the possibility that the gunman has made it out of the country, but he said it was still seen as more likely that search efforts would yield results inside Turkey.\n\nAt least 39 other people -- including 11 women -- are already in custody over suspected links to the attack on Istanbul\u2019s upscale Reina nightclub during New Year\u2019s celebrations.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has claimed responsibility for the massacre, saying it was in reprisal for Turkish military operations in northern Syria. Most of the victims of the attack were foreigners from the Middle East.\n\nTurkish media have widely published images of the suspect, including a\u00a0selfie video filmed at Istanbul\u2019s Taksim Square.\n\nPrior to Kaynak\u2019s remarks suggesting a Uighur was being sought, Sabah newspaper, which is close to the government, said the suspect is a Kyrgyz national born in 1988.\n\nSecurity has been tightened around Istanbul and at border crossings and airports to prevent him from fleeing Turkey.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus suggested in an interview with the Hurriyet Daily news newspaper and other sister publications that \u201cforeign intelligence services\u201d could be behind the attack, pointing at the \u201cprofessional\u201d manner in which it was carried out.\n\n\u201cI am of the opinion that it\u2019s not possible for the perpetrator to have carried out such an attack without any support.

The line of severe thunderstorms spawned several possible tornadoes as the storms moved across Alabama, Georgia and the Florida Panhandle. The worst of the storms had passed through the region by late Tuesday morning as the system headed toward the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nCBS Dothan, Alabama affiliate WTVY-TV reports\u00a0that four people died on Monday night when two trees toppled onto a house in southern Houston County during an apparent tornado. Three others in the home escaped without injury.\n\nHouston County Emergency Management Director Chris Judah said: \u201cIt is a very dangerous scene. One of the trees cut the trailer in half.\u201d He said those killed had huddled in one area of the mobile home while the other three were in another part.\n\nAlabama Gov. Robert Bentley said in a statement on social media that the Houston County sheriff had told him about the deaths and he offered \u201cprayers for those impacted.\u201d\n\nCBS Mobile affiliate WKRG-TV reports the Gulf Shores area was hit with severe winds and rain, but no deaths were reported there. The local zoo is reported to have rescued cages of Lemurs and birds who were blown into a pond on the property.\n\nIn Mossy Head, Florida, a 70-year-old man drowned Monday, apparently accidentally, the Walton County Sheriff\u2019s Office says, adding that deputies found his car partially submerged \u201cand his body floating face-down\u201d near his trailer.\n\nTeams of surveyors were headed out Tuesday to assess apparent tornado damage at three sites in southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, said Mark Wool, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nState emergency officials reported no injuries or deaths in Louisiana and Mississippi, but a trip to Walmart was memorable for some shoppers in Marksville, Louisiana, as severe weather blew out skylights in the store, sending water and glass cascading onto shoppers.\n\nMarksville Fire Chief Jerry Bordelon said a fireworks stand in the Walmart parking lot was tossed 30 or 40 yards and mangled. The storm also knocked over 18-wheel truck trailers and punched holes in the Walmart\u2019s roof. The fire department ordered shoppers to leave the store, but some didn\u2019t want to leave even as managers closed it.\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, we had some people in there who were still trying to shop,\u201d Bordelon said.\n\nWalmart spokeswoman Erica Jones said the Arkansas-based company hopes to reopen the store Tuesday, but isn\u2019t sure that will happen, citing needed repairs to a natural gas line.\n\nStorms in central Mississippi near Mendenhall and Mount Olive were preliminarily identified as tornadoes by the National Weather Service, based in part on radar signatures. Both storms damaged farm buildings and homes. Other possible tornadoes will be surveyed later.\n\nIn Louisiana, there was also relatively serious damage in the southwestern parishes of Beauregard and Allen, including the town of Reeves. Some wind damage was also reported in Houston and throughout East Texas. Though Arkansas had also been included in warnings, there was only a stray report of hail in Jackson County in the northeast part of the state.\n\nTens of thousands lost power in Louisiana and Mississippi at the height of the storm, according to utilities.\n\nFreddie Zeigler, a meteorologist in the Weather Service\u2019s New Orleans office, said heavy winds were preceding the squall line, possibly contributing to power outages.\n\nIt was the second episode of heavy rain within days for some areas. An area stretching from Biloxi, Mississippi, through Alabama and across Macon and Augusta, Georgia, received more than 4 inches of rain Monday, according to radar estimates. Parts of southern Mississippi and southwest Alabama have received more than 8 inches of rain since Saturday. Though rivers along the Gulf Coast were rising rapidly Monday, only minor flooding was predicted. Rains in recent weeks have eased drought conditions across parts of the Southeast, according to reports from the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Nebraska. Despite the rain and storms, large parts of north Alabama and north Georgia remain in \u201cexceptional drought\u201d - the most severe category - according to the center\u2019s most recent report on the drought issued last week.

Though Mr. Obama declined to explicitly offer Trump advice, the president said he\u2019d been served well by selling his assets and investing them in Treasury bills.\u00a0 \u201cIt simplified my life,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI did not have to worry about the complexities of whether a decision that I made might even inadvertently benefit me.\u201d\u00a0 Good government advocates have criticized Trump\u2019s decision not to liquidate his sprawling business interests, but put them in a blind trust entrusted to his children, who are playing major roles in helping him form his administration and are expected to remain involved in one capacity or another.\u00a0\n\nMr. Obama said he was proud his administration hadn\u2019t faced the scandals he said have \u201cplagued\u201d other administrations. He said after eight years, he felt he could tell Americans he\u2019d lived up to his promise to run an accountable and ethical government.\u00a0 He summed up the rule of thumb his first White House counsel used to come up with policies for his administration: \u201cIf it sounds like it would be fun, then you can\u2019t do it.\u201d\u00a0 Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks came as he concluded his final world tour as president. For Mr. Obama, it was the last time he\u2019d take questions on foreign soil, a staple of his overseas trips that his administration has seen as an important symbol of America\u2019s commitment to a rigorous free press.\u00a0 Mr. Obama chatted briefly earlier Sunday with Russian President Vladimir Putin as the summit got under way. The conversation, which was likely to be the leaders\u2019 last face-to-face interaction, lasted just four minutes.\u00a0 Mr. Obama later told reporters he encouraged Putin to uphold his country\u2019s commitments under the Minsk deal aimed at ending the Ukraine conflict. Both the White House and the Kremlin said the leaders had agreed that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov should keep working throughout Mr. Obama\u2019s final months on initiatives to lower violence in Syria and alleviate suffering.\u00a0\n\nPutin, speaking later in Lima, said he and Mr. Obama had noted that while their working relationship had been difficult, they\u2019d \u201calways respected each other\u2019s positions -- and each other.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI thanked him for the years of joint work, and said that at any time, if he considers it possible and will have the need and desire, we will be happy to see him in Russia,\u201d Putin said.\u00a0 The short interaction came amid intense speculation and concern about whether Trump\u2019s election might herald a more conciliatory U.S. approach to Russia. Under Mr. Obama, the U.S. has enacted severe sanctions on Russia over its aggressive behavior in Ukraine and has sought unsuccessfully to persuade Moscow to stop intervening in Syria\u2019s civil war to help prop up Syrian President Bashar Assad.\u00a0\n\nQuestions about Trump trailed Mr. Obama throughout his final overseas trip, as anxious world leaders quizzed him on Trump\u2019s stances on key issues like trade, foreign policy and the NATO alliance. On his final day in Peru, Mr. Obama sought to reassure world leaders gathered here that their longstanding ties with the U.S. wouldn\u2019t falter under Trump.\u00a0 Sitting down with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia, Mr. Obama said he assured Turnbull that the alliance between their countries would remain as strong as ever. Turnbull said he and Mr. Obama were of the mind on trade - an issue Trump sees quite differently. Still, he added that Australia wanted the U.S. to succeed under Trump.\u00a0 Both the U.S. and Australia helped negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade agreement involving 10 other Pacific Rim countries. But Congress is unlikely to ratify the deal, dealing a blow to Mr. Obama\u2019s once high hopes of having the agreement become part of his presidential legacy. Trump says trade deals can hurt U.S. workers, and he opposes TPP.\u00a0 Mr. Obama, who met with TPP country leaders the day before, said they\u2019d told him they want to move ahead with the deal.\u00a0 \u201cPreferably, they\u2019d like to move forward with the United States,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\u00a0 He alluded to a competing deal China is trying to broker that he said would be worse for workers and environmental concerns.\u00a0 Meeting with Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Mr. Obama said he had no doubt the close and important U.S.-Canada relationship will persist after he leaves office, saying that\u2019s been constant with Republican and Democratic administrations alike. Trudeau said he\u2019s invited President-elect Donald Trump to visit Canada soon after Inauguration Day and hopes to welcome him to Canada.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.116279073059559, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 775, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.19315237851, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161121010000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 2.96774193548387, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-michael-heart-failure-died-questions-about-british-pop-singers-health/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [798, 929, 1354, 1399, 1412, 2698, 2914, 3496, 3722, 4170]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 510, "scraper_regex": 689}}, "headline": "George Michael's heart failure death sparks questions", "wordcount_as_scraped": 689, "date": "20161226180000", "story_content": "A day after the sudden death of long-time pop icon George Michael, many fans are struggling to understand how the fit-looking 53-year-old singer suddenly died of a heart condition.\n\nConfirmed by his London-based publicist on Christmas Day, Michael died in his sleep of heart failure.\n\nHeart failure, also referred to as congestive heart failure, happens when someone\u2019s heart muscle doesn\u2019t pump blood as well as it should.\n\nSome health conditions are linked to the disease, including coronary artery disease (when the arteries in the heart narrow, cutting off blood supply), high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes, according to Mayo Clinic experts.\n\nMichael had a history of health issues. In 2011, he was hospitalized with a life-threatening\u00a0bout of pneumonia. At the time, he thanked the staff at Vienna General Hospital for keeping him alive in the intensive care unit. \u00a0\n\nWhile the details of what led to Michael\u2019s death have not been publicly revealed, it occurred at a time of year when heart issues are especially likely to crop up, experts say. Studies show heart-related deaths are five percent more likely around Christmas and New Year\u2019s, perhaps due to factors like excess food, alcohol, stress and lack of exercise this time of year. These behaviors are especially risky for people with\u00a0high blood pressure, a major risk factor for\u00a0heart attack\u00a0and stroke.\n\nIn Michael\u2019s particular case, unless an autopsy is performed, it will be difficult to know what happened, said Dr. Chip Lavie, medical director of Cardiac Rehabilitation and Prevention and director of the Exercise Laboratories at the Ochsner Clinical School in New Orleans.\n\nPossible underlying causes could include any number of issues: a fatal heart rhythm disturbance, a ruptured aneurysm, a pulmonary embolism, Lavie, who was not involved in Michael\u2019s treatment, told CBS News.\n\nDuring his earlier career, Michael\u2019s drug use and taste for risky sex were splashed across the tabloids. After years of avoiding the issue in public, he eventually came to speak openly about his homosexuality and referenced it in his music.\n\nMichael also revealed in a 2004 GQ interview that a former boyfriend had died in 1993 of an AIDS-related brain hemorrhage.\n\nHIV-related health issues or a drug overdose can also potentially lead to heart failure, said Lavie, but again noted that he is not privvy to any of Michael\u2019s personal health information.\n\nSudden death from heart failure may not be the whole story, Dr. Dan Bensimhon, medical director of the Advanced Heart Failure & Mechanical Circulatory Support Program at Cone Health System in Greensboro, North Carolina, told CBS News.\u00a0\n\n\u201cVery few things cause healthy people to die suddenly. I suspect he may have had a serious underlying health issue that led to his acute heart issue,\u201d said Bensimhon, who also had no involvement in Michael\u2019s case.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t typically die suddenly from heart failure. Progressive heart failure is a slow, insidious process through which people are very symptomatic with shortness of breath, weakness and swelling,\u201d Bensimhon explained. \u201cThat said, people with weak hearts which cause heart failure are predisposed to dangerous heart rhythms which can kill them suddenly and that is why we place implantable defibrillators (ICDs) in these patients. I suspect the announcement that he died from heart failure is not the complete story.\u201d\n\nIt seems especially unusual for someone Michael\u2019s age.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe incidence of heart failure increases with increasing age so we see it mostly in people over 60,\u201d Bensimhon said, \u201cbut we unfortunately can see it in younger people as well due to a variety of viruses and other causes.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIt can be hard for patients to recognize what\u2019s wrong and seek treatment. \u201cThe symptoms can be insidious at the onset, including progressive fatigue, cough and shortness of breath and often people aren\u2019t diagnosed until they have very advanced heart dysfunction and wind up in the hospital,\u201d Bensimhon said.\n\nThere are medications and other treatments that can reduce symptoms and extend the lives of people experiencing heart failure, he added.\u00a0\n\nExercising, eating a low-sodium diet, maintaining a healthy weight and managing stress can help prevent heart failure, experts say.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.733812808990481, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 510, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.782029569731, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 6, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161226180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.1764705882352902, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.545454545455}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/aleppo-evacuations-in-heavy-snow-as-brutal-war-chapter-comes-to-close/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1677, 4522]}}, "headline": "Hundreds evacuate Aleppo in heavy snow as brutal war chapter comes to close", "wordcount_as_scraped": 911, "date": "20161222030000", "story_content": "BEIRUT -- Hundreds of rebel fighters and civilians, including small children swaddled in thick blankets, were bused out of war-ravaged Aleppo in heavy snow on Wednesday as the evacuation of former rebel strongholds entered its final phase. Scenes of buses slowly driving out of Aleppo in a shroud of white offered an evocative finale to what has been one of the most brutal chapters in Syria\u2019s civil war. The departures from Aleppo pave the way for President Bashar Assad to assume full control there, after more than four years of fighting over Syria\u2019s largest city. It marks the most significant victory for Assad since an uprising against his family\u2019s four-decade rule swept the country in 2011. The evacuations were set in motion last week after Syria\u2019s opposition agreed to surrender its last footholds in eastern Aleppo. Since then, about 25,000 fighters and civilians have been bused out, according to the United Nations. On Wednesday, buses began evacuating the last rebels and civilians, an estimated 3,000 people. By nightfall, 25 buses carrying hundreds of people had driven in a rare snow storm from eastern Aleppo to opposition-held areas in the countryside near the city, said opposition activist Ahmad Primo, who was monitoring arrivals at the main drop-off point in the Rashideen district. The evacuees got off the buses wearing thick jackets and carrying sacks with belongings. One woman dressed in a black robe and face veil carried a small child swaddled in a heavy yellow blanket. A man held a toddler whose face was peeking out from under a blanket shielding him from falling snow.\u00a0\n\nThe opposition\u2019s Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Wednesday evening that with the evacuation of the last group of rebels from eastern Aleppo, Assad was in full control, save for a few positions on the western outskirts of the city that were still in rebel hands. Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross said patients and all those requiring medical care had been evacuated from the last hospital in the city\u2019s east. Pro-government forces repeatedly struck medical facilities in rebel-held neighborhoods in their push to expel the opposition from Aleppo this year. In November, the U.N. said it believed there were no more functioning medical facilities in the eastern part of the city. Wednesday\u2019s bus movements came after evacuations had been suspended for 24 hours, one of several snags and delays since the first bus convoys left the city last week. Frequent disagreements have erupted between the rebels and the government, as well as among rebel groups, over compliance with a wider deal that also includes evacuations from two rebel-besieged villages, Foua and Kfarya. The ICRC said about 750 people have been bused out of the villages, leaving hundreds more to be evacuated. Meanwhile, it was unclear if any U.N. observers were on the ground in eastern Aleppo on Wednesday - two days after a U.N. Security Council resolution approved their urgent deployment. Deputy U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said some U.N. staff were present at a Syrian government checkpoint outside Aleppo\u2019s eastern sector, but he couldn\u2019t say for sure if any observers had been let into the onetime rebel-held area. Elsewhere in northern Syria, fighting intensified in the ISIS-controlled town of al-Bab, where Turkish troops and Turkey-backed Syrian opposition fighters have been trying to drive the extremists out. Turkey\u2019s state television said 10 Turkish soldiers were killed Wednesday in three separate suicide attacks in al-Bab. The report by TRT television came hours after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said IS was fighting \u201cfor dear life\u201d in al-Bab, carrying out suicide bombings and attacks with improvised explosive devices. A total of 35 Turkish soldiers have died in northern Syria since August, when Turkey sent ground troops to support the Syrian opposition forces in clearing a border area of IS militants and to curb Syrian Kurdish territorial expansion. Meanwhile, a 7-year-old Syrian girl who was evacuated on Monday from eastern Aleppo and whose mother ran a Twitter account in her name met with Erdogan in the Turkish capital, Ankara. Bana Alabed\u2019s mother, Fatemah, began operating the account in September, tweeting on her daughter\u2019s behalf. The account has garnered some 354,000 followers, and has included tweets to Michelle Obama and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, asking for help.\u00a0\n\nAt the United Nations, the Security Council approved the delivery of humanitarian aid across borders and conflict lines in Syria for another year, in a resolution aimed at reaching thousands in need in rebel-held areas. The resolution, adopted unanimously, noted the \u201cthe continued deterioration of the devastating humanitarian situation in Syria,\u201d where more than 13.5 million people require urgent assistance. Also at the U.N., the General Assembly voted to establish an investigative body that will assist in documenting and prosecuting the most serious violations of international law in Syria, including possible war crimes and crimes against humanity. The 193-member world body adopted the resolution over strenuous objections from Syria and Russia, who accused the assembly of interfering in the work of the Security Council. A U.N. board of inquiry said it had received reports that an attack on an aid convoy on the outskirts of Aleppo in September, which killed 10 people and injured 22, was \u201chighly likely\u201d to have been carried out by the Syrian air force but it was unable to reach a definitive conclusion. A summary of the board\u2019s report was released by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

That\u2019s up three and a half percent from last year.\n\nFlying is considered the safest way to travel, but it can still have problems. Two Southwest jets made emergency landings this week, and a United Airlines plane skidded to a stop in San Antonio when its landing gear collapsed.\n\nIn October, at least two dozen people suffered minor injuries when an American Airlines plane burst into flames at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare Airport, forcing 170 people to evacuate. Some of the passengers filed a lawsuit claiming American Airlines was negligent in supervising and directing the evacuation.\u00a0\n\nFor decades, airlines have tried to capture the public\u2019s attention about what to do in an emergency through safety videos, onboard demonstrations, placards in seat-back pockets and even cute animated cartoons. But if there\u2019s one message flight attendants want the traveling public to know in an emergency, it\u2019s to leave everything behind \u2014 including your carry-on, reports CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg.\n\nSeconds before takeoff, American Airlines Flight 383 came to an abrupt stop when its right engine became engulfed in flames.\n\n\u201cEveryone on the right side of the plane jumped up and jumped onto us because as soon as the explosion happened, there was fire,\u201d said Sarah Ahmed Furno. The business traveler was inside the smoke-filled plane as panic set in. \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see anything and there\u2019s absolute chaos in the cabin. So at that point there\u2019s a stampede and everyone\u2019s jumping on each other.\u201d\n\nAhmed Furno is one of 18 passengers involved in a lawsuit against American Airlines and the plane and engine manufacturers, Boeing and General Electric. Among the allegations is that American \u201cfailed to instruct\u201d passengers on \u201cproper and safe evacuation procedures.\u201d \n\nCellphone video taken onboard shows the plane\u2019s overhead bins in the open position, indicating that some passengers took their carry-on bags with them when they left the plane. \n\n\u201cI saw two flight attendants at the front of the plane and they yelled at me and said, \u2018Oh, leave your bag,\u2019\u201d Ahmed Furno recalled. \u201cI was the last one off and I just \u2014 I ignored them and jumped down the slide.\u201d \n\nThe incident is the latest in what\u2019s becoming an alarming trend during aircraft emergencies. In August, passengers were seen heading for the door with their bags as smoke filled an Emirates Air Boeing 777 in Dubai.Photos posted to social media showed the same rule being broken aboard a British Airways jet in Las Vegas last year, and after the 2013 crash landing of an Asiana plane in San Francisco. For any aircraft to be certified as airworthy, flight crews have to demonstrate they can evacuate a fully loaded plane, with half the exits blocked, in less than 90 seconds. But the question remains \u2014 who\u2019s training the passengers? In a cabin simulator, Delta flight attendants are trained how to evacuate a fully-loaded plane. Everyone here knows what to do in emergency. But in a real-life disaster, the situation is far less predictable.\n\n\u201cMedical emergencies, decompressions, security \u2014 you name it,\u201d said Pauline Harrison, a safety instructor with Delta Airlines. \u201cOur biggest challenge is that people do want to take their luggage off an aircraft. Why in the world would you stop and take a selfie or take a bag or anything like that?\u201d \n\n\u201cBut we live in a selfie world where everybody wants to take that selfie,\u201d Greenberg said. \n\n\u201cYes sir, but that person that does that is going to keep you from getting out of that aircraft,\u201d Harrison said. \n\nFlight attendants said the problem lies in part with the safety video. As detailed and entertaining as they might be, they said passengers either don\u2019t listen closely or worse yet, ignore the video altogether. That\u2019s what happened before US Airways Flight 1549 made its famous emergency landing in New York\u2019s Hudson River in 2009.\n\n\u201cBefore the flight, only 12 of our passengers had read the safety briefing card and only about 24 had paid attention to the safety demonstration,\u201d said CBS News aviation and safety expert Chesley Sullenberger.  Sullenburger was the captain of the legendary flight now known as the \u201cMiracle on the Hudson,\u201d in which all 155 passengers and crew survived. He fears it may not be until people die during an evacuation that the traveling public finally pays attention. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that it doesn\u2019t take a high body count in a horrific accident where people cannot escape to finally remind people that they must leave their belongings behind,\u201d Sullenberger said.\n\nAmerican Airlines responded to the lawsuit with a statement issued to \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d saying: \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our pilots, flight attendants, and other team members who responded quickly to take care of our customers under very challenging circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn one final note of irony, Sullenberger said that on that miraculous day on the Hudson, passengers who grabbed their bags as they left the plane ended up losing them in the river. But those who followed instructions and left without their luggage eventually had their bags returned.

The Project on Government Oversight, an advocacy group, first reported last week that Adm. Mike Rogers, director of NSA, had placed Ellard on leave and recommended that he be terminated. Ellard is appealing that decision.\n\nEllard received attention in 2014 for remarks at Georgetown University Law Center criticizing Snowden, the former NSA contractor who had leaked secret documents about the surveillance program. Snowden says he went public because he feared retaliation from his superiors if he had raised his concerns with them. Ellard said at Georgetown that Snowden could have safely come to him.\n\nEllard\u2019s case is the first to move completely through a process created by President Barack Obama in 2012 to ensure that intelligence employees can effectively report waste, fraud and abuse while protecting classified information. The directive prohibits agencies from retaliating against them or taking away security clearances or an employee\u2019s access to classified information.\n\nThe case stemmed from a whistleblower\u2019s claims of financial misconduct by NSA officials involving a conference in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThe whistleblower, in a brief email to The Associated Press, said that after he raised his concerns, his name was disclosed to Ellard in violation of rules intended to protect government employees who want to report misconduct.\n\nThe whistleblower said his email response had been cleared by the NSA. The agency declined to comment independently on the case. Ellard\u2019s attorney did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear who revealed the whistleblower\u2019s identity to Ellard. But the whistleblower said that after Ellard learned who he was, \u201cI was denied an assignment within the NSA inspector general\u2019s office of investigations because of my whistleblowing.\u201d He sent the email to the AP on condition of anonymity because the case is still active.\n\nRogers\u2019 decision to recommend Ellard\u2019s dismissal followed an eight-month investigation by a panel of inspectors general at the CIA, Treasury and Justice Department, according to an intelligence official, who was not authorized to disclose details about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. The trio was empaneled in October 2015 and issued its decision in May.\n\nThe Justice and Defense departments declined to comment on the decision.\n\nLouis Clark, director of the Government Accountability Project, said he was happy that the process set up by Obama\u2019s directive was finally being used, but expressed disappointment that it has taken so long for it to happen. \u201cIt was so slow because the intelligence agencies are extremely hostile to whistleblowing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fate of Obama\u2019s directive is uncertain. It will be up to Donald Trump, after he becomes president, to decide whether to continue it. Trump has said he doesn\u2019t trust the intelligence agencies, but it\u2019s not clear if that would make him more or less likely to protect whistleblowers.\n\nTimothy Edgar, Obama\u2019s first director of privacy and civil liberties for the White House national security staff, says there is cause for serious concern about the future of whistleblowers.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re left with, I think, is probably primarily the integrity and bravery of people in the bureaucracy, who, despite those obstacles are willing to say \u2018no\u2019 if they are involved in activities that they think are serious violations of the Constitution,\u201d Edgar said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.50318479537964, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 587, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.12424026283, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.4071550255536605, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trump-administration-orders-epa-media-blackout-contract-freeze/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [296, 530, 1912, 1913, 2397, 2699, 2895, 2896, 5178, 5684]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 733, "scraper_regex": 1145}}, "headline": "Trump admin orders EPA media blackout and contract freeze", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1145, "date": "20170124220000", "story_content": "Last Updated Jan 24, 2017 7:24 PM EST\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has instituted what it described as a temporary media blackout at the Environmental Protection Agency and barred staff from awarding any new contracts or grants.\u00a0\n\nEmails sent to EPA staff since President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday and reviewed by The Associated Press detailed specific prohibitions banning press releases, blog updates or posts to the agency\u2019s social media accounts.\u00a0\n\nThe Trump administration has also ordered what it called a temporary suspension of all new business activities at the department, including issuing task orders or work assignments to EPA contractors. The orders were expected to have a significant and immediate impact on EPA activities nationwide. Similar orders barring external communications have been issued by the Trump administration at other federal agencies in recent days, including the Agriculture and Interior departments. Staffers in EPA\u2019s public affairs office are instructed to forward all inquiries from reporters to the Office of Administration and Resources Management. \u201cIncoming media requests will be carefully screened,\u201d one directive said. \u201cOnly send out critical messages, as messages can be shared broadly and end up in the press.\u201d \n\nA memo that went out to some members of the EPA staff and was obtained by CBS News outlined a list of bulleted restrictions.\n\n\u201cNo press releases will be going out to external audiences,\u201d it said. \u201cNo social media will be going out. A Digital Strategist will be coming on board to oversee social media. Existing, individually controlled, social media accounts may become more centrally controlled.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo blog messages,\u201d it added.\n\nA review of EPA websites and social media accounts, which typically include numerous new posts each day, showed no new activity since Friday. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Office of Public Affairs at the EPA headquarters issued a statement saying, \u201cThe EPA fully intends to continue to provide information to the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cA fresh look at public affairs and communications processes is common practice for any new Administration, and a short pause in activities allows for this assessment,\u201d the statement said.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday he had no information on the blackout. He said aides were looking into the circumstances.\u00a0\n\nDoug Ericksen, the communications director for Trump\u2019s transition team at EPA, said he expects the communications ban to be lifted by the end of this week. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to get a handle on everything and make sure what goes out reflects the priorities of the new administration,\u201d Ericksen said.\u00a0\n\nBeyond what was stated in the internal email, Ericksen clarified that the freeze on EPA contracts and grants won\u2019t apply to pollution cleanup efforts or infrastructure construction activities. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nEricksen told CBS News that the agency transition team is trying to get a handle on how many social media accounts exist within the agency and its 10 different regions. For now, he said, there is a hold on social communications so that the agency transition team can identify the accounts and ensure all communications going out reflect the new administration\u2019s views. Ericksen said there is a freeze on some grants and contracts, but not all. He described the freeze as an effort to \u201cget a handle on all the money going out the door.\u201d  He expects these holds to be lifted and said the timing would be decided by transition officials in consultation with the White House.\n\nThe executive director for the advocacy group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, Jeff Ruch, said the orders go beyond what has occurred in prior presidential transitions. \u201cWe\u2019re watching the dark cloud of Mordor extend over federal service,\u201d Ruch said Tuesday, referring to the evil kingdom in the epic fantasy, The Lord of the Rings.\n\nRuch noted that key posts at EPA have not yet been filled with Republican appointees, including Trump\u2019s nominee for EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt. That means there are not yet the new senior personnel in place to make key decisions. Environmentalists said the orders were having a chilling effect on EPA staff, many of whom were suffering from low morale. Trump and Pruitt have both been frequent critics of the agency and have questioned the validity of climate science showing that the Earth is warming and man-made carbon emissions are to blame. Liz Perera, climate policy director for the Sierra Club, said Trump\u2019s move to freeze all EPA communications and contracts should be \u201ca major red flag for all Americans.\u201d \u201cEPA was created to ensure that all Americans can enjoy clean air to breathe, clean water to drink and have their health protected from environmental and climate threats,\u201d Perera said. \n\nAt President Trump\u2019s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, environmental professors like Bethany Wiggin listened carefully to candidate Trump talk about climate change, which is why she, her colleagues and her students are now racing to back up on other servers information available on government websites, CBS News\u2019 Jim Axelrod reported. \u00a0\n\nTemporary restrictions announced on Tuesday -- that EPA employees can no longer post or blog from government accounts -- stoked their fears that the administration will limit access to data as it rolls back environmental protections.  \u201cI\u2019m really worried that the facts might become more difficult to access,\u201d Wiggins said. \u201cSo, there\u2019s kind of a vulnerability of internet materials already, she said. \u201cThey become more vulnerable still when controlled by an administration who finds them inconvenient.\u201d\u00a0\n\nStaff at the Agriculture Department have also received orders not to release any documents to the public. \u201cThis includes, but is not limited to, news releases, photos, fact sheets, news feeds and social media content,\u201d read the email memo, which was obtained by The Associated Press. Agricultural Research Service spokesman Christopher Bentley said the ban would not include scientific publications released through peer-reviewed professional journals. \u201cAs the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s chief scientific in-house research agency, ARS values and is committed to maintaining the free flow of information between our scientists and the American public as we strive to find solutions to agricultural problems affecting America,\u201d Bentley said, according to a statement. The agency said that \u201cinformation on our projects, people and locations\u201d would still be available on its website. AP reported over the weekend that staff at the Interior Department were temporarily ordered to stop making posts to its Twitter account. The prohibition came after the official account of the National Park Service, a bureau of the department,retweeted a pair of posts to its 315,000 followers that seemed to be a swipe at Trump on his initial day in office. The first was a photo that compared the crowd gathered on the National Mall for Trump to the much-larger gathering that stood in the same spot eight years earlier for President Barack Obama\u2019s swearing-in. Trump later falsely claimed that more than 1 million people attended his inauguration, which Spicer insisted was the most-watched in history.

Chris Christie were convicted Friday of creating an epic traffic jam at the George Washington Bridge for what prosecutors say was political revenge, capping a trial that cast doubt on Christie\u2019s claims he knew nothing about the scheme.\n\nBridget Kelly, Christie\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, a Christie appointee to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were found guilty of all counts against them. Kelly cried as the verdict was read; Baroni showed no emotion. Both defendants announced plans to appeal.\n\nThe verdict comes after defense attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have a mistrial declared on Thursday, CBS New York station WCBS-TV reports.\n\nChristie said Friday that the verdict affirmed his decision to terminate Baroni and Kelly and that the jury held them responsible \u201cfor their own conduct.\u201d He repeated his assertions that he had no knowledge of the plot and said he would \u201cset the record straight\u201d soon about \u201cthe lies told by the media and in the courtroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and had no role in authorizing them,\u201d Christie said. \u201cNo believable evidence was presented to contradict that fact. Anything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said Kelly and Baroni plotted with Christie ally David Wildstein to close lanes at the foot of the nation\u2019s busiest bridge - a span that connects New Jersey to New York City - and create gridlock in September 2013 to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee for not endorsing Christie for re-election.\n\nKelly, Baroni and Wildstein all testified that Christie was informed about the lane closings either before or while they were going on.\n\nBaroni\u2019s attorney, Michael Baldassare, called the case a disgrace and said the U.S. attorney\u2019s office should be \u201cashamed\u201d of where it drew the line on who to charge.\n\n\u201cThey should have had belief in their own case to charge powerful people and they did not,\u201d Baldassare said.\n\nU.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said Friday that prosecutors only charged people where they had \u201cevidence beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d to convict.\n\nThe federal jury took five days to reach a verdict in the scandal that helped sink Christie\u2019s Republican campaign for president. The verdict on charges including conspiracy, misapplying the property of the Port Authority, wire fraud and deprivation of civil rights came before the judge ruled on the defense request to declare a mistrial.\n\nThe most serious charges carry up to 20 years in prison. Sentencing was scheduled for Feb. 21.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, who helped lead a legislative effort to investigate the lane closings, said it was a terrible day for New Jersey and \u201ca terrible day to have a spotlight on the kind of administration that was run.\u201d\n\nWildstein, a high-ranking Port Authority official, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the scheme and was the prosecution\u2019s star witness. He faces a maximum of 15 years in prison but is expected to be sentenced to much less. His sentencing hasn\u2019t yet been scheduled.\n\nKelly and Baroni testified they believed the lane closings were part of a legitimate traffic study because, they said, that was what Wildstein told them.\n\nThe defense portrayed Wildstein as a liar and a dirty trickster - \u201cthe Bernie Madoff of New Jersey politics\u201d - and argued that Christie and his inner circle had thrown the 44-year-old Kelly under the bus.\n\n\u201cThey want that mother of four to take the fall for them. Cowards. Cowards,\u201d Kelly attorney Michael Critchley said in a thundering closing argument.\n\nOne of the most damning pieces of evidence was an email in which Kelly wrote: \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d Then, as the four days of gridlock unfolded and Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich complained about children unable to get to school, she texted: \u201cIs it wrong that I am smiling?\u201d\n\nOn the stand, Kelly explained that she was referring to what she thought was a traffic study and expressing satisfaction that it was going well. As for why Kelly deleted the messages, her lawyer suggested she was afraid she was about to be made the scapegoat.\n\nWildstein said that Christie was told about the traffic jam as it was happening and that he laughed and sarcastically joked that nothing political was going on when he learned of Sokolich\u2019s distress over not getting his calls returned.\n\nBut it was not clear from Wildstein\u2019s testimony whether Christie knew the bumper-to-bumper mess was manufactured for political reasons. And Kelly testified that she told Christie the lane closings were a traffic study when she informed him of the plans about a month ahead of time.\n\nSiding with prosecutors, U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton told jurors they didn\u2019t have to find that Kelly and Baroni, also 44, knowingly intended to punish Sokolich in order to convict them of conspiracy.\n\nThe gridlock began on the first day of school and held up commuters, school buses and emergency vehicles. Sokolich\u2019s pleas went unanswered for four days - on orders from Wildstein, the defendants testified.\n\nAt the time, Christie was considered a top GOP presidential contender and was trying to run up a big landslide re-election victory to demonstrate his crossover appeal as a White House candidate.\n\nChristie ultimately dropped out of the presidential race after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary and said recently that the scandal probably influenced Donald Trump\u2019s decision not to pick him as his running mate. Christie is a now a top Trump adviser and has campaigned for him.\n\nChristie was expected to campaign for Trump in battlegrounds Pennsylvania and New Hampshire this weekend. A message left with the Trump campaign Friday wasn\u2019t immediately returned.\n\nWhile the trial did not definitively pin the scheme on Christie, it reinforced his reputation among his critics as a bully, with accounts of profane tirades, threats of bodily harm and tough-guy posturing among the governor and his inner circle that seemed straight out of \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d\n\nChristie once threw a water bottle at Kelly in anger, she testified. And Wildstein told the jury that Christie called him \u201cMr. Wolf,\u201d after the character in the movie \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d who is called in to clean up dead bodies.\n\nAccording to testimony, Christie\u2019s office also used the Port Authority to punish or reward local politicians. Among the goodies the agency dispensed were pieces of steel from the original World Trade Center, destroyed on 9/11.\n\n\u201cThese convictions will be an essential defining feature of Christie\u2019s legacy in office, and will forever taint how his administration is perceived and will be remembered,\u201d Montclair State University political science professor Brigid Callahan Harrison said. \u201cHe is damaged by the narcissistic way in which he was portrayed during the trial, a narrative that was accepted by the jury.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.55877351760864, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1089, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.57129738613, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161104220000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.47933884297521, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-do-cbs-news-correspondents-predict-will-happen-in-2017/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 503, "scraper_regex": 559}}, "headline": "What do CBS News correspondents predict will happen in 2017?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 559, "date": "20161224180000", "story_content": "\u201cFace the Nation\u201d host John Dickerson will discuss predictions for 2017 with a panel of CBS News correspondents in a segment that will air Sunday.\n\nCBS News Justice and Homeland Security Correspondent Jeff Pegues said that he predicts FBI Director James Comey will stay in his job despite the blowback he received from how he handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and the last-minute discovery of related emails a week before the election. \n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people in Washington who might disagree with that.

The law remains divisive in the country, with opinions equally split between 45 percent with favorable views of it and 45 percent who see it negatively, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. \n\nHealth-services stocks took a dive on Wednesday morning, reflecting expectations from investors that a Trump presidency will deliver major changes to the law. Because the ACA has boosted demand for treatment, thanks to the additional 20 million Americans who gained health insurance as a result, its repeal could lead to sharply lower demand for health care and pharmaceutical services.\n\nYet it\u2019s not clear that Trump will be able to completely erase the law because the Republican-dominated Senate will lack the 60 votes needed for a full repeal. \n\nObamacare \u201chas clearly been a touch point for Republican campaigns across the country,\u201d said Michael Moran, principal for global risk analysis at Control Risks, on a conference call to discuss the election results. \u201cRepealing it is a very difficult proposition. Trump has been careful about talking about replacing it with something. It\u2019s like, what is that something?\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Democrats will dig their heels in.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s clear that Trump is going to challenge the law. Here are five questions about the future of Obamacare under the new president. \n\nHow could Trump repeal it?\u00a0Even though Trump will have a Republican-dominated Congress, the Senate majority will lack the 60 votes needed to pass a full repeal. Because of that, Trump\u2019s goal of a full repeal may be \u201ca challenge\u201d for his presidency, Georgetown University\u2019s Jack Hoadley told NPR.\n\nYet Congress has another way to make changes to the health care act: Use the Senate\u2019s budget reconciliation process, which requires only 50 votes. That process allows the upper chamber to expedite legislation related to some tax, spending and debt-limit issues. \n\nA bill Republicans drafted last year hints at what type of changes could be pushed through the reconciliation process, Vox.com noted. The bill would erase the tax credits that now help middle- and low-income Americans afford health insurance plans bought on the ACA exchanges and end the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion. While Obama vetoed that bill, Trump and GOP members of Congress could aim to gut the ACA act through such a process.\n\nWhat happens to people with insurance through the exchanges?That will depend on what changes the Republicans make to the health care law. Removing the tax credits would make insurance unaffordable for many who currently buy their plans through the exchanges, which would likely cause large numbers of Americans to drop their plans. \n\nStill, it\u2019s unlikely that the Republicans would repeal or significantly change the ACA without having a backup ready to roll out. Without a Plan B, about 20 million Americans would lose coverage. Trump has said he would propose new measures to replace Obamacare. \n\nWhat would replace it? Trump hasn\u2019t specified much about his plans, although he has said he would create measures to help people to buy insurance outside of the Obamacare exchanges. \n\nHis proposals would allow insurers to sell plans across state lines and to allow Americans to use tax-free Health Savings Accounts, which currently are limited to people who are younger than 65 and who have a high-deductible health insurance plan. He has also proposed Medicaid block-grants to states and to allow Americans to buy prescription drugs from overseas as a way to find lower-price medications. \n\nWould Obamacare\u2019s popular aspects remain? The ACA exchanges have proved to be magnets for opponents of the health care law because of sharply spiking premiums and technical glitches. But some other parts of the law remain popular with Americans, such as the right to keep your children on your insurance until they turn 26 and prohibiting insurers from denying coverage because of previous health issues. \n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the GOP would keep those provisions, although some Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s health care plan kept the under-26 coverage as well as the ban on barring people with preexisting conditions from getting insurance. That may hint that the GOP would consider keeping those two provisions.\n\nWhat happens to the health care industry? More uncertainty and upheaval. One immediate impact: a sharp decline in stocks prices for health services companies. Hospital-chain HCA Holdings (HCA) and health care services company Tenet Healthcare (THC) were among those suffering sharp declines on Wednesday. Their stocks tumbled on concerns that an Obamacare repeal or partial rollback would lead to fewer patients seeking treatment. \n\nOn the other hand, pharmaceutical companies saw a boost to their share prices. Pfizer (PFE), for one, spiked on Wednesday. Drug company stocks had been suffering previously because of concern that Democrat Hillary Clinton would put pressure on them to lower prices. \n\nSaid Kathy Bostjancic, director of U.S. Macro Investor Services on a conference call to discuss Trump\u2019s win: \u201cThere\u2019s a relief rally potential in the health care sector, especially in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.342075258493423, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 820, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.5536036883099995, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161110110000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8048780487804903, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeff-sessions-trump-attorney-general-pick-a-buzzkill-for-legal-pot/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [659, 1859, 2171, 2884, 2885, 3116, 3155, 3504, 3855]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 582, "scraper_regex": 614}}, "headline": "Trump's attorney general: A buzzkill for legal pot?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 614, "date": "20161118230000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s selection of Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions as U.S. attorney general is killing the buzz of the marijuana industry -- big time -- given his vocal opposition to legalization.\n\nEric Altieri, the executive director of NORML, a nonprofit that has been pushing to make weed legal since 1970, described Sessions as an \u201canti-marijuana zealot\u2019 in a blog post on the organization\u2019s website because the senator has linked cannabis use to abuse of more dangerous drugs like cocaine and heroin. Many experts dispute that notion, which was widely held during the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d decades ago.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSenator Sessions is clearly off the reservation when it comes to issues of marijuana policy and he stands diametrically opposed to the majority of Americans who favor the legalization and regulation of marijuana,\u201d Altieri wrote. \u201cThis could foreshadow some very bad things for the eight states that have legalized marijuana for adult use and in the 29 states with medical marijuana programs.\u201d\n\nOthers advocates, such as the Marijuana Policy Project, are striking a more diplomatic tone, noting that most Americans support legalization. Aaron Smith, the head of the National Cannabis Industry Association, echoed those views, arguing that Sessions has long advocated for state\u2019s rights, \u201cand we look forward to working with him to ensure that states\u2019 rights and voter choices on cannabis are respected.\u201d\n\nMason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, added: \u201cWe hope Sen. Sessions, or whoever is confirmed as our next attorney general, will use federal law enforcement resources to protect our country\u2019s citizens, not to defy the laws those citizens have adopted.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Sessions declined to comment. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.\u00a0\n\nSome activists are worried about losing the ground they\u2019ve gained during the Obama administration when the industry thrived after former Attorney General Eric Holder instructed federal law enforcement officials not to interfere with states that legalized marijuana as long as they followed certain guidelines.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat we are going to see is increased enforcement from the DEA,\u201d said Stephen Bradley, who runs the blog SouthernCannabis.org, adding that Obama\u2019s marijuana policies \u201ccan easily be rolled back, and we can start seeing DEA raids at legal dispensaries and producers. It\u2019s not going to be hard for them to start doing this again. Not at all.\u201d\n\nOn the same day when voters stunned the political establishment in electing Trump as America\u2019s 45th president, voters in California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada agreed to allow recreational use of marijuana, doubling the states where that use is allowed. Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota joined the more than two dozen that allows medical cannabis use. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nSessions\u2019 home state of Alabama is an exception. The Marijuana Policy Project says it has some of the harshest marijuana laws in the country, where possession of a single joint is punishable with up to a year in prison. However,\u00a0Alabama Republican Gov. Robert Bentley\u00a0recently signed a law that permits the possession of medical marijuana oil to treat people with certain medical conditions such as severe epilepsy.\n\nSales of legal weed are expected to hit $50 billion in 2026, an increase of more than 1,000 percent from the $5 billion seen today, according to a recent report by Cowen & Co. A recent poll by Gallup\u00a0found that 1 in 8, or 13 percent, of adults said they were regular marijuana users. That\u2019s up from 7 percent in 2013.\n\nStill, it remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will really take on a movement like marijuana legalization, which so many Americans support -- and which provides millions in tax dollars to state and local governments.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.636942684650421, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 582, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.41209075662, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161118230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 3.78006872852234, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nimrud-3000-year-old-city-wrecked-by-isis-is-left-for-looters/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [397, 753, 874, 1554, 3862, 4214, 5733, 5893, 6664, 7758, 7890, 8384, 8738]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1476, "scraper_regex": 1572}}, "headline": "3,000-year-old city wrecked by ISIS is left for looters", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1572, "date": "20170106190000", "story_content": "NIMRUD, Iraq -- The giant winged bulls that once stood sentry at the nearly 3,000-year-old palace at Nimrud have been hacked to pieces. The fantastical human-headed creatures were believed to guard the king from evil, but now their stone remains are piled in the dirt, victims of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria\u2019s fervor to erase history.\u00a0\n\nThe militants\u2019 fanaticism devastated one of the most important archaeological sites in the Middle East. But more than a month after the militants were driven out, Nimrud is still being ravaged, its treasures disappearing, piece by piece, imperiling any chance of eventually rebuilding it, an Associated Press team found after multiple visits last month.\u00a0\n\nWith the government and military still absorbed in fighting the war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)\u00a0in the nearby city of Mosul, the wreckage of the Assyrian Empire\u2019s ancient capital lies unprotected and vulnerable to looters. No one is assigned to guard the sprawling site, much less catalog the fragments of ancient reliefs, chunks of cuneiform texts, pieces of statues and other rubble after ISIS blew up nearly every structure there. Toppled stone slabs bearing a relief from the palace wall that the AP saw on one visit were gone when journalists returned. \u201cWhen I heard about Nimrud, my heart wept before my eyes did,\u201d said Hiba Hazim Hamad, an archaeology professor in Mosul who often took her students there. \u201cMy family and neighbors came to my house to pay condolences.\u201d\u00a0\n\nPerhaps the only vigilant guardian left for the ruins is an Iraqi archaeologist, Layla Salih. She has visited it multiple times in recent weeks, photographing the destruction to document it and badgering nearby militias to take care of it. Walking with the AP across the broad dirt expanse of the ruin, she was calm, methodical and precise as she pointed out things she\u2019d seen on previous visits that were no longer in place. Still, Salih does not despair. She searches out reasons for optimism. \u201cThe good thing is the rubble is still in situ,\u201d she said. \u201cThe site is restorable.\u201d To an untrained eye, that\u2019s hard to imagine, seeing the extent of the destruction that ISIS wreaked in March 2015. Salih estimated that 60 percent of the site was irrecoverable. The site\u2019s various structures - several palaces and temples - are spread over 900 acres on a dirt plateau. A 140-foot-high ziggurat, or step pyramid, once arrested the gaze of anyone entering Nimrud. Where it stood, there is now only lumpy earth.  Just past it, in the palace of King Ashurnasirpal II, walls are toppled, bricks spilled into giant piles. The palace\u2019s great courtyard is a field of cratered earth. Chunks of cuneiform writing are jammed in the dirt. Reliefs that once displayed gods and mythical creatures are reduced to random chunks showing a hand or a few feathers of a genie\u2019s wing. During a Dec. 14 assessment tour by UNESCO, a U.N. demining expert peered at a hole leading to a tomb that appeared to be intact. It might be rigged to explode, the expert said, and the UNESCO crew backed away. The militants boasted of the destruction in high-definition video propaganda, touting their campaign to purge their self-declared \u201ccaliphate\u201d of anything they deemed pagan or heretical. They dismantled the winged bulls, known as lamassu, as purposefully as any decapitation they carried out in in Mosul or the Syrian city of Raqqa. The bearded male heads of the statues are missing - likely taken to be sold on the black market as ISIS has done with other artifacts. They then wired the entire palace with explosives and blew it apart, along with the temples of Nabu and of the goddess Ishtar. It was a brutal blow to a site that gave the world a wealth of startling Mesopotamian art and deepened knowledge about the ancient Mideast.\u00a0\n\nNimrud was a capital of the Assyrians, one the ancient world\u2019s earliest and most ferocious empires. Known at the time as Kalhu, the city was the seat of power from 879-709 BC, an era when Assyrian armies expanded out across the Levant, capturing Damascus and other cities, crushing the kingdom of Israel and turning its neighbor Judah into a vassal.\u00a0\n\nA British-Assyrian team first excavated Nimrud in 1945, then it was re-excavated in the 1950s by Max Mallowan. Though famous in his own right at the time, Mallowan is better known as the husband of Agatha Christie, who accompanied him and photographed and filmed the digs. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of the most beautiful sites in the Middle East, or at least it was,\u201d said Georgina Herrmann, a British archaeologist who worked at Nimrud with Mallowan. \u201cIt used to be covered with wildflowers. You\u2019d be there and there\u2019d be bits of ancient sculptures sticking out.\u201d Besides the reliefs and statues, archaeologists dug up hundreds of stone tablets written in cuneiform letters containing everything from treaties to temple and palace records. The tombs of queens yielded troves of gold and jewelry. Iraqi archaeologists also made a grisly find: more than 100 skeletons inside a palace well, including some with shackled hands and feet, possibly prisoners dumped in when Nimrud was sacked in 610 BC. Salih, 40, came to Nimrud a few days after ISIS fighters were driven out in early November. So far, she is the only Iraqi antiquities official to visit. Ancient Assyria is not even Salih\u2019s field; she specialized in Islamic art and architecture. But there was no one else to do it. Half of the 50-odd government archaeologists in Mosul are still trapped there under ISIS rule. She confirmed what satellite images had already shown: sometime between Sept. 1 and Nov. 4 as international forces closed in, ISIS bulldozed the ziggurat.\u00a0\n\nIt had never been explored by archaeologists. \u201cWhat exactly was inside it only ISIS knows,\u201d said Herrmann, using another acronym for the Islamic state group.\u00a0\n\nTouring the site, UNESCO\u2019s representative to Iraq, Louise Haxthausen, called the destruction \u201cabsolutely devastating.\u201d \u201cThe most important thing right now is to ensure some basic protection,\u201d she said. But the government has many priorities right now. It is still fighting ISIS in Mosul. Moreover, there is a long and expensive list of needs in rebuilding the country from ISIS\u2019legacy. Tens of thousands of citizens live in camps. Large swaths of the western city of Ramadi were destroyed in the offensive to wrest it from ISIS control. Mass graves are unearthed nearly every day in former ISIS territory, with more than 70 discovered already. Other ancient sites remain under ISIS control, including Nineveh - another ancient Assyrian capital - in the heart of Mosul.\u00a0\n\nNimrud is in an active war zone, on the edge of the Tigris River valley south of Mosul. To reach it, one drives through checkpoints of multiple armed groups fighting ISIS - the Iraqi military, Shiite militias, Kurdish peshmerga and Christian fighters. None of those forces is assigned to guard Nimrud. The first three times the AP visited, Sunni and Shiite fighters eventually showed up after an hour, apparently after hearing of the team\u2019s presence. During the UNESCO tour, Salih noticed that some of the ancient bricks from the palace rubble had been neatly piled up as if to be hauled away. She questioned two Shiite militiamen about them. \u201cBoth of them told me different stories,\u201d she said in exasperation. One said Islamic State extremists did it, intending to sell the bricks; the other said the militia members themselves stacked them to protect them. Salih believes neither story and thinks someone had hoped to take the bricks to repair homes damaged in fighting. It\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s missing, because no one even knows what\u2019s in the piles of rubble to know if it\u2019s being stolen.\u00a0\n\nTwo locals were recently arrested with a marble tablet and stone seal from Nimrud, presumably to sell. The men remain in custody.\u00a0\n\nThe artifacts seized from them, however, are harder to track down. The police insisted they were at a lab in Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish region in northern Iraq. The lab said it knew nothing about them. The Antiquities Ministry in Baghdad said they were safe in the Ninevah government offices, while an official in those offices said they were with the police awaiting transit to Baghdad. It was a perfect circle of confusion - one that makes it easy for someone to simply steal items.\u00a0\n\nSalih is working to get international funding to pay someone to guard the site. But she recognizes that job will have to go to one of the militia factions. She has no illusions that the militias will provide full protection. But she has grown used to compromises that once would have been unimaginable. Before she fled her home in Mosul soon after the\u00a0ISIS takeover in 2014, she and other archaeologists pleaded with the militants to let them destroy the city\u2019s ancient tombs that the group so despised. At least that way, the buildings housing the tombs could be spared. The plea was futile, and ISIS detonated the buildings and tombs. So she will negotiate now with the militias to do as much as they can to preserve Nimrud. On the final visit with the AP, wind-whipped winter rains sent rivulets of water through the loose dirt, further dislodging the remains. \u201cThere isn\u2019t another choice, as you see,\u201d she said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.13016271591187, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1476, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 15, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 7, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.81389174359, "HarmVirtue": 11, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 43, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170106190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.91327913279133, "mft_mean": 3.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sherri-papini-sheriff-courageous-mom-offers-more-details-on-captors-in-bizarre-abduction/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [587]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 633, "scraper_regex": 692}}, "headline": "Calif. woman offers investigators more details on bizarre abduction", "wordcount_as_scraped": 692, "date": "20161201000000", "story_content": "Last Updated Dec 1, 2016 8:56 AM EST\n\nREDDING, Calif. -- A northern California sheriff says a mother who was abducted and \u201cbranded\u201d by her captors has given investigators more details about the two women she says held her captive for three weeks.\n\nSherri Papini, 34, disappeared Nov. 2 after going for a jog near Redding. She was found Thanksgiving Day bound along the side of a road by a motorist she flagged down in Yolo County about 150 miles south of where she vanished. Papini\u2019s husband Keith has said the woman was\u00a0emaciated, covered with bruises and burns, had her hair cut off and was chained at the waist and wrists when she was found.\n\nKeith Papini said his wife had endured mental and physical abuse and was beaten repeatedly. Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko confirmed at a Wednesday press conference that the woman had been \u201cbranded\u201d by her captors before they released her, but didn\u2019t provide details. \n\nBosenko said investigators still have not been able to determine a possible motive or discern whether the crime was targeted or random. Bosenko had initially said police were searching for two Hispanic women driving a dark SUV, armed with a handgun.\n\nMajor crimes detectives have been able to conduct more detailed interviews with Sherri Papini over the last two days, Bosenko said Wednesday. He described the interviews as \u201cvery intense\u201d for both the detectives and Papini. He said Papini had to re-live traumatic events and hailed her as \u201ccooperative and courageous.\u201d\n\nBosenko said Papini was \u201cheld against her will and was isolated\u201d during her captivity, but he wouldn\u2019t speak to where she was held or whether it was more than one location. He said Papini couldn\u2019t provide detailed information to investigators about her captors\u2019 appearance because they covered their faces, and also sometimes covered her head. However, she did offer some clues.\n\nIn the interviews, Papini described a \u201cyounger\u201d suspect as having a thick accent, pierced ears, long curly hair and thin eyebrows, Bosenko said. She described the second, \u201colder\u201d suspect as having straight black hair with some gray, and thick eyebrows. She said the two women spoke Spanish most of the time.\n\nInvestigators showed Papini surveillance video of dark SUVs seen near the location of her abduction, according to Bosenko, but she said none of the vehicles matched the one her captors were driving.\n\nThe sheriff acknowledged there are still \u201ca lot of unknowns\u201d about the abduction and the suspects. He said investigators are working with a sketch artist to determine whether there\u2019s enough information to develop suspect sketches.\n\n\u201cSherri was taken from us for 22 days, and suffered incredibly through both intense physical agony and severe mental torture,\u201d Keith Papini said in the statement released to Good Morning America Tuesday. \u201cMy reaction was one of extreme happiness and overwhelming nausea as my eyes and hands scanned her body. I was filled with so much relief and revulsion at once. My Sherri suffered tremendously and all the visions swirling in your heads of her appearance, I assure you, are not as graphic and gruesome as the reality.\u201d\n\nBosenko said he wasn\u2019t aware Keith Papini was going to release the information about his wife\u2019s battered condition and said it\u2019s possible the details could affect the integrity of the investigation. Speaking on Good Morning America Tuesday, Bosenko said he was \u201cfamiliar\u201d with the details but they hadn\u2019t yet been publicly released.\n\nSpeaking on the show Wednesday, Bosenko said it\u2019s possible \u201csick\u201d individuals cut off the woman\u2019s hair in an attempt to humiliate her. He said the brand was a \u201cmessage\u201d rather than a symbol.\n\nResponding to a reporter\u2019s question, Bosenko said Wednesday there\u2019s no information to indicate the abduction was related to a drug cartel or sex trafficking.\n\nEvidence uncovered in Yolo County was being turned over to the California Department of Justice for physical examination and processing. Investigators are seeking additional search warrants for cell phone information and delving into Papini\u2019s past for clues, he said. He urged anyone with information to call the Shasta County Sheriff tipline at 530-245-6135.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.88505744934082, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 633, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.77680184415, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161201000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.5276461295418597, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/imf-chief-christine-lagarde-guilty-arbitration-case/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [673, 1141, 1599, 3677]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 644, "scraper_regex": 679}}, "headline": "IMF chief Christine Lagarde guilty in arbitration case involving flamboyant tycoon's $425M payout", "wordcount_as_scraped": 679, "date": "20161219160000", "story_content": "PARIS \u2014 Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, was found guilty by a French court of negligence on Monday in a case involving the French state handing $425 million in taxpayer money to a tycoon close to the president in 2008.\n\nCBS News\u2019 Elaine Cobbe reports Lagarde, who was not in court to hear the verdict, will escape punishment, and the guilty verdict will not appear on her record. \n\nThe well-respected head of the IMF has denied wrongdoing in the case, which dates to her time in the French government when she was economy and finance minister. \u00a0\n\nThe trial took place before the Court of Justice of the Republic, a special body that tries government ministers for alleged wrongdoing while in office. The court is made up of three professional magistrates from the highest French court, including its president, and 12 members of Parliament, from opposition and majority parties.\n\nThe trial put Lagarde, 60, in jeopardy of facing up to a year in prison and a 15,000-euro ($16,000) fine if convicted of negligence.\u00a0\n\nLagarde\u2019s conviction may raise concern about her ability to remain IMF boss. The Washington-based institution\u2019s credibility was already shaken when her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, also a French citizen, was forced to resign amid a wave sexual assault and sexual impropriety allegations in 2011. A previous IMF chief, Rodrigo Rato, faced allegations of fraud in Spain after the bank he led as chairman had the biggest collapse in Spanish history..\u00a0\n\nThe IMF\u2019s board has so far supported Lagarde at all stages of the French legal proceedings, which began the month after her appointment in July 2011.\n\nLagarde, the first woman to become finance minister of a Group of Eight country and to be appointed IMF chief, was tried for her role in a 2008 arbitration ruling that awarded 403 million euros ($425 million) to French business magnate Bernard Tapie, an ally of then-President Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nTapie, a flamboyant tycoon and former TV star, had sued French bank Credit Lyonnais for its handling of the sale of his majority stake in sportswear company Adidas in the mid-1990s.\n\nWhen Lagarde became finance minister in 2007, the lengthy legal battle between Tapie and the public bank was still unresolved, and she ordered to settle it through an unusual private arbitration panel, instead of regular courts, against the advice of her own services.\n\nThe choice of arbitration proved disastrous for the state by leading to the massive payout to Tapie from public funds. The amount of the award prompted indignation in France.\n\nInvestigating judges say Lagarde committed a series of serious errors when she made the arbitration choice and also, later on, when she refused to challenge the deal, suggesting she may have been influenced by the political connections between Tapie and Sarkozy, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cMs. Lagarde\u2019s behavior proceeds not only from a questionable carelessness and precipitation, but also from a conjunction of faults which, by their nature, number and seriousness, exceed the level of mere negligence,\u201d the judges wrote at the end of their investigation.\n\nSoon after the arbitration deal was notified, investigators suspected that the whole process was rigged in favor of the magnate.\n\nIn 2013, Tapie, his lawyer, one of the arbitrators and Lagarde\u2019s chief of staff at the ministry, Stephane Richard, now the CEO of the telecom company Orange, were charged with gang-related fraud, and Lagarde\u2019s Paris home was searched by police. Tapie later got another charge of misappropriation of funds.\u00a0\n\nIn 2015, a court quashed the arbitration deal, and then ordered Tapie to pay the money back. Last June, the top French court ruled the arbitration was fraudulent.\n\nChristopher Mesnooh, legal analyst and lawyer with the Paris, New York and Washington bars, said the whole Tapie case is \u201chighly political\u201d and that French citizens have a \u201cstrong feeling about it\u201d because \u201cthere is a question of public money involved.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Lagarde) had a high government position when the decision was made to pursue the arbitration and then not to appeal the award,\u201d he told The Associated Press.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.97866296768188, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 644, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.2305171175200003, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161219160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.48447204968944, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-nominee-confirmation-hearing-addresses-race-muslim-ban-and-torture/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [5345, 8865]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1417, "scraper_regex": 1497}}, "headline": "Jeff Sessions addresses race, Muslim ban and torture at confirmation", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1497, "date": "20170110220000", "story_content": "Sen. Jeff Sessions faced a flurry of questions Tuesday regarding his record defending minorities and on voting rights, as well as his positions on immigration policy and the use of torture at his confirmation hearing to become attorney general. \n\nRepublicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee mostly defended Sessions, expressing confidence that he would be confirmed, while Democrats used the opportunity to attack his voting record. \n\nThe Alabama Republican, who has served in the Senate for 20 years, was even asked a question about the 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape that surfaced in October in which President-elect Donald Trump made lewd comments about women. \n\n\u201cIs grabbing a woman by her genitals, without consent, is that sexual assault?\u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, asked Sessions. \n\n\u201cClearly it would be,\u201d Sessions said. \n\nSessions also announced during the hearing that he would recuse himself from any investigations involving Hillary Clinton and her use of private email servers as secretary of state. \n\n\u201cI believe the proper thing for me to do, would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kind of investigations that involve Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign or to be otherwise connected to it,\u201d Sessions told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n\nMr. Trump said during the second general-election debate between the president-elect and Clinton that he would instruct his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her situation. \n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, asked if Sessions would recuse himself as attorney general if the probe into Russian interference in the election leads to involvement by the Trump campaign or associates of the president-elect.\n\n\u201cMy recusal issue was because I had made public comments about it that could be construed on the final judgment on it,\u201d Sessions said about his decision to recuse himself from Clinton investigations. \u201cI will review it and try to do the right thing,\u201d Sessions promised. Durbin said that it would be \u201can obvious case for special prosecutor.\u201d\n\nDuring the day-long hearing, which is scheduled to continue Wednesday, Sessions rejected allegations that he has failed to protect the voting rights of black people and that he has praised the Ku Klux Klan. \n\n\u201cThese are damnably false charges,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cI abhor the Klan and what it represents and its hateful ideology.\u201d \n\nSessions said during the hearing, which was interrupted by sporadic outbursts from protesters, that he \u201cnever declared the NAACP was un-American or that a civil rights attorney \u201cwas a disgrace to his race.\u201d \n\n\u201cI deeply understand the history of civil rights in our country and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters. I have witnessed it. We must continue to move forward and never back. I understand the demands for justice and fairness made by our LGBT community. I will ensure that the statutes protecting their civil rights and their safety are fully enforced,\u201d he said in his opening statement. \n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, asked Sessions to explain his previous comment in which he described the Voting Rights Act as an \u201cintrusive piece of legislation\u201d and asked him how he\u2019ll actively enforce the remaining pieces of the law such as the one that prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race.\n\n\u201cThe Voting Rights Act passed in 1965 was one of the most important acts to deal with racial difficulties that we face,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cIt changed the whole course of history particularly in the south.\u201d Sessions was asked about states\u2019 voter ID laws and he said, \u201cI think voter ID laws, properly drafted, are okay.\u201d\n\nLeahy, the former top Democrat on the panel, asked Sessions if he agrees with Mr. Trump\u2019s original plan to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. \n\n\u201cI have no belief and I do not support the idea that Muslims, as a religious group, should be denied admission to the United States,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nSessions said that Mr. Trump has since made clear that he believes that the focus should be on people who are coming from countries with histories of terrorism. At the same time, Sessions suggested that he believes that religious beliefs, that embrace wanting to harm the U.S., can be taken into consideration in the vetting process and can be grounds to deny someone entry into the country. \n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, later asked Sessions what he would characterize as an extreme view in relation to enhanced vetting.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the vetting process is in the hands of the State Department and the consular offices,\u201d Sessions said, adding that the approach that\u2019s \u201cpreferable\u201d is focusing on people who are based in areas \u201cwhere we have an unusually high risk of terrorists coming in.\u201d \n\nDemocrats repeatedly pointed out that Sessions has voted against bans against torture and grilled him on what he would do as attorney general if Mr. Trump tried to bring back waterboarding or other enhanced interrogation techniques. \n\n\u201cThere was a dispute about that when we had had the torture definition in our law,\u201d Sessions said when asked if he believes whether waterboarding constitutes torture.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice memorandum concluded it did not necessarily prohibit that. But Congress has taken an action now that makes it absolute improper and illegal to use waterboarding or any other form of torture in the United States by our military and by all our other departments and agencies.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, asked Sessions whether he plans to advise Mr. Trump to reverse President Obama\u2019s 2012 execution action that created DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that has deferred deportations for hundreds of thousands of people who came to the U.S. illegally as children. \n\n\u201cIt would certainly be constitutional, I believe, to end that order,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cI think would have no objection to a decision to abandon that order because it is very questionable, in my opinion, constitutionally.\u201d\n\nAsked what should happen to 800,000 kids who have come out of the shadows, Sessions didn\u2019t directly answer that question except that Congress should work with the administration to pass immigration reform. Durbin later said that Sessions \u201copposed the only bipartisan effort that we\u2019ve had on the Senate floor in modern memory.\u201d \n\nSessions was asked if he believes that the Russians were behind the cyberattacks during the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI have done no research into that. I just know what the media has said about it,\u201d said Sessions, who was also asked if he has any reason to doubt the accuracy of the conclusion of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia used cyberattacks to influence the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI have no reason to doubt that and have no evidence to indicate otherwise,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, asked if the Justice Department and FBI will be allowed to continue investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election even if it leads to the Trump campaign, the president-elect\u2019s interests and associates.\n\n\u201cIf there are laws violated, and it can be prosecuted, of course you have to handle that in an appropriate way,\u201d Sessions said, adding that he believes it\u2019s appropriate for \u201ca nation to retaliate against those actions\u201d like cyberattacks involving the election.\n\nSeveral Democrats expressed concern with Sessions\u2019 previous comments about the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade to protect a woman\u2019s right to choose in which he said the ruling was \u201cone of the worst, colossally erroneous Supreme Court decisions of all time.\u201d Sessions said he still holds that view, but that he would follow the law.\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cI believe it violated the Constitution and really attempted to set policy and not follow law. It is the law of the land. It is been so established and settled for a long time and it deserves respect and I would respect it and follow it.\u201d\n\nWhile Sessions initially stated during the hearing that he has supported the Violence Against Women Act, including in 2000, in 2005 and a proposal by Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, he was called out for opposing the 2013 reauthorization measure that is now law. Leahy asked why he voted against expanding protections for LGBTQ victims, immigrants and tribal victims of domestic violence in the 2013 reauthorization, which he said passed \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d in both the Senate and GOP-controlled House at the time. \n\nSessions said that there was a \u201cconcerning provision\u201d that gave tribal courts jurisdiction over non-tribal members. \n\nIn his opening statement, Sessions expressed concern about the rise of violence and an escalating murder rate.\u00a0\n\nHe stressed the importance of the Justice Department serving as a \u201cunifying force\u201d for improving relations between the police and communities, especially in minority communities and he said he would hold law enforcement accountable when necessary. \n\n\u201cMake no mistake, positive relations and great communication between the people and police are essential for any good police department. And when police fail in their duties, they must be held accountable,\u201d he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.33333325386047, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1417, "FairnessVirtue": 13, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.45361771415, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 6, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 58, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170110220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.09315455187015, "mft_mean": 5.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tapes-contradict-cops-version-of-fatal-shooting-of-black-drummer-corey-jones/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2270]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 637, "scraper_regex": 675}}, "headline": "Tapes contradict cop's version of fatal shooting of black drummer Corey Jones", "wordcount_as_scraped": 675, "date": "20170118130000", "story_content": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- An undercover police officer is never heard identifying himself before fatally shooting a black drummer whose car had broken down on an interstate highway, according to evidence released Tuesday by prosecutors who have charged him with manslaughter.\n\nThe Palm Beach County state attorney\u2019s office released thousands of documents, photos and video and audio recordings to former Palm Beach Gardens officer Nouman Raja\u2019s attorneys and the public, including recordings of two phone calls and Raja\u2019s interview with investigators hours after the shooting.\n\nThose recordings played key roles in prosecutors charging Raja, 39, with manslaughter and attempted murder last year for the October 2015 shooting of 31-year-old Corey Jones, whose SUV had broken down on an Interstate 95 off-ramp before dawn as he returned home from a performance.\n\nRaja, who is of South Asian descent, has pleaded not guilty and his attorneys and union have said the shooting was justified since Jones was armed.\n\nJones, who also worked as a housing department inspector, was sitting in his SUV talking to a tow truck dispatcher when Raja, who was investigating car burglaries, drove an unmarked white van the wrong way up the off ramp, according to records.\n\nWearing a T-shirt and jeans, Raja got out of the van and came toward Jones, who had a Florida concealed carry permit for the handgun. His family said he had just purchased the gun to protect the expensive drum gear in his vehicle\u2019s trunk.\n\nNewly-released photos show Raja had a police tactical vest in his van, which identified him as a police officer, but for some reason chose not to wear it when he approached Jones in the SUV, reports CBS West Palm Beach affiliate WPEC-TV.\n\nProsecutors say Jones had no way of knowing Raja was a police officer because he had no badge and no uniform on, the station notes.\n\nAs Raja neared the SUV, the door chime began sounding, the recording shows, indicating Jones had opened the door.\n\nAs he apparently exited, Jones told Raja, \u201cNo. I\u2019m good. Yeah, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Raja replied, with Jones quickly responding \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nSuddenly Raja yelled for Jones to raise his hands, twice using profanity.\u00a0 Jones responded, \u201cHold on. Hold on.\u201d Raja, again using profanity, told him to raise his hands before firing two shots.\n\nJones began running down an embankment and into the grass as Raja fired several more shots, killing him. Jones\u2019 unfired gun was found about 75 feet from his SUV. Jones\u2019 body was found another 125 feet away.\n\nIn a 911 call that prosecutors say Raja placed about 30 seconds later, the officer yells for Jones to drop his gun even though they say he knew Jones had been felled by his shots.\n\nAbout four hours after the shooting, Raja told Palm Beach County sheriff\u2019s detective Kenny Smith in a voluntary interview that he had walked up to the van thinking it was unoccupied and that he was surprised when he saw Jones inside.\n\n\u201cThe door swung open and, uh, this guy jumps outside immediately,\u201d Raja told Smith. \u201cHe got out of the van and then he\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m OK, I\u2019m OK man.\u2019 And at which point I said, \u2018Hey, man, police, can I help you?\u2019 And the second I said police, he jumped back and I clearly remember him drawing and ... pointing a gun at me.\u201d He said he ordered Jones to drop the gun and then fired when he didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like, you know, your family flashed in front of you, your kids flashed in front of you,\u201d Raja told Smith. He said he called 911 as he was chasing Jones and fired again only after Jones turned back toward him with the gun.\n\nThe recording of the 911 call contains no gunshots.\n\nRaja was fired shortly after the shooting. Jones\u2019 family is suing him and the Palm Beach Gardens police.\n\nA court hearing is set for Feb. 21. There, a date for Raja\u2019s criminal trial could be scheduled.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.89208650588989, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 637, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.45959077427, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.82574568288854, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/northern-ireland-crisis-ex-ira-martin-mcguinness-sinn-fein-resigns/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Political crisis threatens N.

She will be forced from office, at least temporarily, if an election is called.\n\nIn a copy of his resignation letter provided to The Associated Press, McGuinness accused Foster of ignoring \u201ca public mood that is rightly outraged at the squandering of public money and allegations of misconduct and corruption.\u201d\n\nThe government, formed under terms of Northern Ireland\u2019s 1998 Good Friday peace accord, requires support from McGuinness\u2019 Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party and Foster\u2019s Democratic Unionists, who represent the British Protestant majority.\n\nTheir unlikely partnership has been credited with governing the long-disputed corner of the United Kingdom in relative harmony following four decades of bloodshed that claimed 3,700 lives.\n\nBut tensions between Sinn Fein and the DUP have come close to breaking point several times. And from the shadows, IRA splinter groups opposed to the outlawed group\u2019s 2005 disarmament and renunciation of violence still seek to sow division and disorder.\n\nIn recent months, McGuinness repeatedly called on Foster to step aside while lawmakers investigate her alleged mismanagement of a government \u201cgreen energy\u201d program. Lawmakers estimate the program could cost taxpayers more than 500 million pounds ($600 million) in inefficiently distributed subsidy payments.\n\nFoster, who became Northern Ireland\u2019s first female leader a year ago, has rejected calls from other parties to relinquish the post and accuses her critics of misogyny.\n\nShe called McGuinness\u2019 resignation \u201cnot principled,\u201d and warned it would leave Northern Ireland without an administration \u201cat precisely the time we need our government to be active.\u201d\n\nBut opposition to Foster has been growing. Lawmakers from all other parties voted for Foster\u2019s temporary removal in a Northern Ireland Assembly no-confidence vote last month. She survived solely because of backing from Democratic Unionist colleagues.\n\n\u201cThat position is not credible or tenable,\u201d McGuinness said in his resignation letter addressed to Assembly Speaker Robin Newton.\n\nMcGuinness said Sinn Fein would refuse to nominate a successor as deputy first minister, a position that wields equal power to Foster\u2019s own in a system designed to promote consensus across the community divide.\n\nIf the position goes unfilled, the 108-member Assembly - elected barely eight months ago - would be dissolved for a fresh ballot. The next election normally would happen in May 2021.\n\nBritain\u2019s minister responsible for overseeing Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, said he would be obliged to call an election if Sinn Fein didn\u2019t nominate a successor within the next seven days.\n\nDuring a news conference in his Stormont Castle office, McGuinness denied that his resignation was linked to health problems that have caused him to skip meetings and foreign trips. Sinn Fein has declined to specify McGuinness\u2019 ailment.\n\nMcGuinness, 66, appeared to have lost weight and looked drawn. He spoke in an unusually weak, at times slurring tone.\n\n\u201cMy health has absolutely nothing to do with this whatsoever,\u201d McGuinness said.\n\nMcGuinness said power-sharing would not be easily revived.\n\n\u201cIf the DUP think in the aftermath of an election they\u2019re going to step back into ministerial positions short of resolving the critical issues,\u201d he said, \u201cthen they\u2019re living in a fool\u2019s paradise.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.55555534362793, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 571, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.0855568633599995, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.72854640980736, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/oakland-ghost-ship-warehouse-fire-district-attorney-investigation-no-stone-unturned/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [313, 1402, 1760, 2269, 2387, 3468, 3647, 3710, 3834, 3835, 5587, 5810, 5844, 5959, 6006, 6034, 6072, 6100, 6147, 6173]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 677, "scraper_regex": 1119}}, "headline": "Sad news for more families as Oakland fire victims identified", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1119, "date": "20161206000000", "story_content": "Last Updated Dec 5, 2016 11:56 PM EST\n\nOAKLAND -- Terry Ewing was among the anxious family and friends who received confirmation Monday of what he already knew in his heart: His girlfriend was among the three dozen killed in the Oakland warehouse fire.\u00a0\n\nAuthorities confirmed the death of Ara Jo as the death toll rose to 36. Prosecutors also said Monday that murder charges could result from their investigation into the fire that broke out during an underground dance party at a building known as the \u201cGhost Ship.\u201d Alameda County Sheriff Gregory Ahern told The Associated Press he didn\u2019t believe there would be additional bodies found in what is the most lethal building fire in the U.S. in more than a decade. But he cautioned that it was \u201cimpossible to be absolutely positive\u201d until the entire recovery effort is complete. Authorities had gone through about three-quarters of the building by Tuesday afternoon. The laborious job of digging with shovels and buckets through the debris was suspended overnight because of a dangerously unstable wall. It resumed in the morning, though a rainstorm Tuesday could complicate the effort. The cluttered warehouse had been converted to artists\u2019 studios and illegal living spaces, and former denizens said it was a death trap of piled wood, furniture, snaking electrical cords and only two exits.\u00a0\n\nThe Alameda Country district attorney said Monday a criminal investigation into the fire continues, but it\u2019s too early to speculate anything.\n\n\u201cPeople are asking, is this a murder case? My answer is -- [the] range of charges could be murder all the way to involuntary manslaughter,\u201d District Attorney Nancy O\u2019Malley said \u201cWe will leave no stone unturned.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSeventy-five percent of the building has now been searched, CBS News correspondent David Begnaud reported. For the last 48 hours, recovery workers have used buckets to separate personal possessions and building materials from human remains. No one knows exactly how many people were in the space during the fire.\n\nAhern said Monday that 33 of the 36 confirmed dead have been identified. Of those, 16 families have been notified, and five notifications are pending. So far, 22 autopsies have been completed.\u00a0\n\nThree of the deceased are from outside of the United States, Ahern said, and are from Finland, Korea and Guatemala.\u00a0\n\nOakland Fire Battalion Chief Melinda Drayton said first responders noticed late Sunday night one of the brick walls of the building was leaning in at least a few inches, so they decided to stop their work.\n\nCBS News correspondent Carter Evans reported that the building\u2019s exterior is mostly made of brick but the interior was mostly wood, which is now mostly burned away, leaving the rest of the structure vulnerable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding people throughout the entire square footage of that structure,\u201d Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Sgt. Ray Kelly said.\n\nKelly told reporters Monday some of the victims texted relatives, \u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d and \u201cI love you.\u201d Kelly said rescue crews have found bodies of people \u201cprotecting each other, holding each other.\u201d Hundreds of people holding candles honored those who died in the fire at a vigil Monday night in Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt. Those in the crowd embracing each other or holding up candles or flowers and saying aloud the names of people they lost in the blaze. Several people in the crowd have signs offering \u201cfree hugs.\u201d\u00a0\n\nVideo posted from inside shows a party going on just before the fire broke out. The warehouse had been converted into an eclectic live-work space for artists. Not much is left.\u00a0\n\nOfficials said they came to inspect the property last month.\u00a0\u201cAll that I know is that we were not able to gain access to the interior of the building,\u201d Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said.\u00a0\u00a0Max Ohr told CBS News he lived at the artists collective for the past two years and helped host Friday\u2019s event, and that he never saw any inspectors visit the place.\n\n\u201cIf there were, we would have let them in,\u201d Ohr said.\n\nCBS News reached out to the building\u2019s owner for comment, but have not yet heard back. Her daughter told the Los Angeles Times they believed the building was only being used as an art collective. An Oakland city councilman said the building was never permitted as a residence and was under investigation. Meanwhile, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is at the scene helping with the investigation.\n\nOakland city councilman Noel Gallo, who lives a block from the warehouse, said he confronted the property\u2019s manager -- Derick Ion Almena -- several times about neighbors\u2019 concerns about trash in the street and in front of the warehouse. Gallo said Almena essentially told authorities to \u201cmind their own business\u201d and appeared resistant to addressing complaints and complying with city codes. Almena and his partner, Micah Allison, ran the building\u2019s arts colony, called the Satya Yuga collective. They were believed to have been away at the time of the blaze. Relatives, friends and former colleagues said Almena loved to surround himself with followers, but seemed to care little for their well-being. Asked late Sunday by San Francisco television station KGO about his thoughts on those killed in the fire, Almena said, \u201cThey\u2019re my children. They\u2019re my friends, they\u2019re my family, they\u2019re my loves, they\u2019re my future. What else do I have to say?\u201d Almena did not respond to emails or calls to phone numbers associated with him by The Associated Press. No one answered a call to a number for Allison.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, bouquets of sunflowers, single white roses, lilies and carnations were stuck in chain-link fences around the building Monday morning, as votive candles burned on sidewalks and post-it notes paid tribute to the\u00a0Oakland fire missing and the dead\u00a0in the most lethal building fire in the U.S. in more than a decade.\n\nFor many, the incident has called to mind the\u00a0Station nightclub fire in Rhode Island in 2003\u00a0that killed 100 people, the\u00a0Kiss nightclub fire in Brazil in 2013\u00a0that claimed 246 lives, and\u00a0last year\u2019s Colectiv nightclub fire in Romania\u00a0that left 64 people dead.\u00a0\n\nIn a statement Monday, President Obama called the Oakland fire an \u201cawful tragedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we still don\u2019t know the full toll of this disaster, we do know that an American community has been devastated, and many people \u2013 including young men and women with their whole futures ahead of them \u2013 have tragically lost their lives,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nThe president called Oakland \u201cone of the most diverse and creative cities in our country,\u201d and promised that the people touched by the tragedy \u201c will have the unwavering support of the American people.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.82087445259094, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 677, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.86682138703, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161206000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.65878877400295, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ashley-madison-agrees-to-pay-1-6m-over-breach/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [991, 3394]}}, "headline": "Adultery web site Ashley Madison agrees to pay $1.6M fine over breach", "wordcount_as_scraped": 515, "date": "20161215010000", "story_content": "TORONTO -- Ruby Corp., the Toronto-based parent company of the adultery dating site Ashley Madison, will pay $1.6 million in settlements following an investigation led by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission into a massive breach of the company\u2019s computer systems and the outing of millions of its members. Hackers broke into the company\u2019s systems in July 2015 and then posted the information online a month later after the company didn\u2019t comply with their demands to shut down Ashley Madison. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Wednesday that reckless disregard for data security will not be tolerated. New York joined 12 other states, the District of Columbia and the FTC in the investigation. \n\nNew York\u2019s attorney general said the investigation found lax data security practices and said the company made several misrepresentations, including a \u201cTrusted Security Award\u201d that appears to have been fabricated.\u00a0\n\n\u201cReckless disregard for data security will not be tolerated,\u201d Schneiderman said in a statement.\n\nIt also found Ashley Madison created fake female profiles to entice male users. In some instances, the attorney general said, it used portions of the profile photographs of actual users who had not had account activity within the previous year as the photographs in the fake profiles that it created. The website - whose slogan was \u201cLife is short. Have an affair\u201d - is marketed to people looking for extramarital relationships. It once purported to have about 39 million members. Husbands and wives across the world were confronted with their partners\u2019 extramarital affairs after the catastrophic leak spewed electronic evidence of infidelity across the internet. The hacking triggered extortion crimes and led to unconfirmed reports of suicides. Forums such as Reddit, a user-powered news and discussion site, carried stories of anguished husbands and wives confronting their partners after finding their data among the massive dump of information. The New York attorney general\u2019s office said the settlement with the company is for $17.5 million but said the remainder of the $17.5 million payment is suspended based on Ruby\u2019s inability to pay. It\u2019s unclear why the company couldn\u2019t afford to pay the entire settlement.In addition to monetary penalties, the attorney general\u2019s office said Ruby agreed to cease engaging in certain deceptive practices, to not create fake profiles, and to implement a stronger data security program. \u201cThis case represents one of the largest data breaches that the FTC has investigated to date, implicating 36 million individuals worldwide,\u201d FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said. \u201cThe global settlement requires AshleyMadison.com to implement a range of more robust data security practices that will better-protect its users\u2019 personal information from criminal hackers going forward.\u201d Vermont Attorney General William H. Sorrell said in a statement that creating fake profiles and selling services that are not delivered is unacceptable behavior for any dating website. \u201cToday\u2019s settlement closes an important chapter on the company\u2019s past and reinforces our commitment to operating with integrity,\u201d Rob Segal, newly appointed CEO of Ruby, said in a statement.\n\nAshley Madison is still in operation, although now it advertises as providing a \u201cdiscreet connection\u201d for anyone.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.076350212097171, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 505, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.7814470856599998, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.3762376237623797, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/another-step-closer-to-artificial-blood/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 922, "scraper_regex": 994}}, "headline": "Another step closer to artificial blood", "wordcount_as_scraped": 994, "date": "20161205170000", "story_content": "Artificial blood stored as a powder could one day revolutionize emergency medicine and provide trauma victims a better chance of survival.\n\nResearchers have created an artificial red blood cell that effectively picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to tissues throughout the body.\n\nThis artificial blood can be freeze-dried, making it easier for combat medics and paramedics to keep on hand for emergencies, said senior researcher Dr. Allan Doctor. He is a critical care specialist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dried powder that looks like paprika, basically,\u201d Doctor said. \u201cIt can be stored in an IV plastic bag that a medic would carry, either in their ambulance or in a backpack, for a year or more. When they need to use it, they spike the bag with sterile water, mix it, and it\u2019s ready to inject right then and there.\u201d\n\nThe artificial blood cell, which is about one-fiftieth the size of a normal red blood cell, is made from purified human hemoglobin proteins that have been coated with a synthetic polymer, Doctor said. Hemoglobin is the component inside red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that as many as 70 percent of battlefield fatalities are due to shock caused by blood loss rather than life-threatening injuries to vital organs, Doctor said. Additionally, about 20,000 trauma deaths in the United States occur each year due to blood loss prior to arriving at a treatment center.\n\nThe hunt for an artificial blood substitute has been underway for more than 80 years, but the closest prior attempts have failed in two major ways, Doctor said.\n\nEarlier versions could capture oxygen in the lungs, but then would not effectively release the oxygen after traveling out to tissues and organs, he said.\n\nThere also was an unintended reaction between \u201cnaked\u201d hemoglobin and nitric oxide, a substance released by the lining of blood vessels that allows the vessels to relax and open up, Doctor noted.\n\n\u201cThe hemoglobin consumes that molecule and causes a constriction of the blood vessels,\u201d Doctor said. \u201cWhen they tried to put naked hemoglobin into the bloodstream, it caused heart attacks and strokes.\u201d\n\nThe synthetic polymer coating of the latest artificial blood cell appears to solve both these problems, Doctor explained. The coating was developed by the study\u2019s lead researcher, Dipanjan Pan, an assistant professor of bioengineering with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nThe surface chemistry of the polymer reacts to the pH level of blood as it travels through the body, Doctor said. It captures oxygen when blood pH is high, and releases oxygen when blood pH is low.\n\n\u201cBlood pH is high in the lungs, is low in tissue, and is even lower in tissue that doesn\u2019t have enough oxygen,\u201d Doctor said. \u201cBy linking oxygen affinity to blood pH, we imitate the behavior of a normal red cell.\u201d\n\nThe polymer coating also keeps the hemoglobin from reacting with nitric oxide in the bloodstream, thus preventing dangerous constriction of the blood vessels, he added.\n\nThere\u2019s also one more benefit -- because the polymer coating is \u201cimmune silent,\u201d the artificial blood can be used in anyone regardless of blood type, Doctor said.\n\nLab tests involving mice and rats have proven that the artificial red blood cells can effectively deliver oxygen to needy tissues, the researchers reported.\n\n\u201cWe replaced 70 percent of the mouse\u2019s blood volume with the blood substitute,\u201d Doctor said. \u201cThose mice were indistinguishable from those who received a transfusion from another mouse.\u201d\n\nBesides emergency settings, the artificial blood also could be used to help keep donated organs alive on route to a recipient, and supplement a hospital\u2019s regular blood supplies during complex surgeries such as open-heart bypass, he suggested.\n\nHowever, the artificial red blood cells will never totally replace the real thing, Doctor said.\n\nFor one thing, they can\u2019t remain in the bloodstream anywhere near as long as regular red blood cells.\n\n\u201cA normal red blood cell circulates about 120 days. This cell right now, we project circulation for about a third of a day to half a day,\u201d Doctor said. \u201cWe may be able to manipulate that and get it up to a couple of days, but I seriously doubt we\u2019ll be able to get to the circulation time of a normal red blood cell.\u201d\n\nThe artificial cell also is designed solely to deliver oxygen, and leaves out a number of other functions that red blood cells provide.\n\nThose other functions include antioxidant protection of tissues, regulation of blood flow, assistance in immune response, and aid in forming blood clots and scabs, said Doctor and Dr. Alan Mast, a senior investigator with the BloodCenter of Wisconsin\u2019s Blood Research Institute.\n\n\u201cI think of these more as artificial oxygen carriers, because they\u2019re not the same as red blood cells,\u201d said Mast, a past president of the American Society of Hematology. He was not involved with the new study. \u201cRed blood cells can do many other physiologic things.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Mast said the development of these artificial cells is \u201cexciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis could buy time for injured soldiers until they can get them to a hospital,\u201d Mast said. \u201cThe product also could be useful in rural areas or areas where traumatic events occur and blood products aren\u2019t readily available.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect it to be available anytime soon though, Doctor warned. It still needs to be tested in rabbits and monkeys, before proceeding to human testing. And studies in animals often fail to produce similar results in humans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a long road, possibly as long as 10 years before we have definitive answers whether this will work in people,\u201d Doctor said.\n\nFindings from the study are scheduled to be presented Saturday at the American Society of Hematology\u2019s annual meeting, in San Diego.

She was 88.\n\nAllan Rubin says his mother died Sunday night of natural causes. A Philadelphia native, Vera Rubin had been living in the Princeton, New Jersey, area, he said.\n\nRubin found that galaxies don\u2019t quite rotate the way they were predicted, and that lent support to the theory that some other force was at work, namely dark matter.\n\nDark matter, which hasn\u2019t been directly observed, is believed to make up 27 percent of universe \u2014 as opposed to 5 percent of the universe being normal matter. Scientists better understand what dark matter isn\u2019t rather than what it is.\n\nRubin never received the Nobel Prize for her work, but her name was long floated for the prestigious award.\u00a0\n\nEmily Levesque, an astronomer at the University of Washington in Seattle, is among those scientists who believe Rubin deserved the honor.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe existence of dark matter has utterly revolutionized our concept of the universe and our entire field; the ongoing effort to understand the role of dark matter has basically spawned entire subfields within astrophysics and particle physics at this point,\u201d Levesque told Astronomy Magazine in June. \u201cAlfred Nobel\u2019s will describes the physics prize as recognizing \u2018the most important discovery\u2019 within the field of physics. If dark matter doesn\u2019t fit that description, I don\u2019t know what does.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her breakthrough discoveries, Rubin was considered a champion for women in astronomy, putting constant pressure on powerful factions in the field to recognize women\u2019s contributions.\u00a0\n\nInvited to the highly regarded Palomar Observatory outside San Diego early in her career, Rubin did not accept the building\u2019s lack of a women\u2019s restroom at face value.\n\n\u201cShe went to her room, she cut up paper into a skirt image, and she stuck it on the little person image on the door of the bathroom,\u201d former colleague Neta Bahcall of Princeton University told Astronomy Magazine. \u201cShe said, \u2018There you go; now you have a ladies\u2019 room.\u2019 That\u2019s the type of person Vera is.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Rubin was reportedly unhappy that stubborn gender inequities continued to pervade her field. In 2000, she told Astronomy writer Ann Finkbeiner she was \u201cgetting fed up... What\u2019s wrong with this story is that nothing\u2019s changing, or it\u2019s changing so slowly,\u201d the magazine reported.\n\nOn Monday, scientists and admirers across the internet mourned Rubin\u2019s passing:\n\nVery sad to hear of #VeraRubin's death. Every year, many of us in physics hoped this might finally be the year she got her Nobel Prize.

When she sought to enroll as a graduate student at Princeton, she learned women were not allowed in the university\u2019s graduate astronomy program, so she instead earned her master\u2019s degree from Cornell University.\n\nRubin earned her doctorate from Georgetown University, where she later worked as a faculty member for several years before working at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, a nonprofit scientific research center.\n\nDuring her career, Rubin examined more than 200 galaxies.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.34003353118896, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 566, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.56163687338, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.4734982332155497, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-caregivers-spend-huge-percent-of-income-on-care-costs-aarp-survey/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1066, 1559, 1781, 3216, 3236, 4150, 4794]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 757, "scraper_regex": 802}}, "headline": "Family caregivers spend a huge percent of their income on care costs", "wordcount_as_scraped": 802, "date": "20161115000000", "story_content": "A huge portion of a caregiver\u2019s salary goes to the needs of their sick family member or loved one, a new study shows.\n\nFamily caregivers spend 20 percent of their income \u2014 an average of $6,954 \u2014 on out-of-pocket costs related to caregiving, according to the AARP Research report.\n\nFor the survey, more than 1,860 family caregivers answered questions and kept a daily diary that tracked all of their out-of-pocket expenses that went toward caregiving. The research was conducted during the summer of 2016, and included men and women currently providing unpaid care to a relative or friend aged 18 or over.\n\nHispanic/Latino and low-income caregivers were especially hard hit \u2014 spending an average of 44 percent of their total annual income to take care of a loved one.\n\n\u201cThe numbers in the study are quite striking,\u201d AARP\u2019s Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond told CBS News. \u201cThe percentage is even higher for caregivers earning less than $32,500 a year. I was just really stunned by that number.\u201d\u00a0\n\nLeaMond said the money goes to a variety of needs, from small items picked up at the store to travel expenses to and from a loved one\u2019s home. It also pays for outside support such as aides to help with bathing, feeding, dressing and cleaning the home of the sick relative or friend. \n\nHousehold expenses \u2014 rent, mortgage payments, home modification such as ramps and handrails \u2014 make up the lion\u2019s share of a family caregiver\u2019s out-of-pocket costs, about 41 percent of their total spending.\u00a0\n\nMedical needs account for the second largest portion of caregivers\u2019 spending \u2014 about 25 percent of the total. That includes nursing care and insurance costs among other medical expenses. \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s and other forms of\u00a0dementia hit caregivers\u2019 pocketbooks especially hard. Family caregivers for adults suffering from dementia reported nearly double the out-of-pocket costs ($10,697) compared to others without dementia. \n\nWhen the findings were broken down by racial and ethnic groups, Hispanic/Latino family caregivers spent an average of $9,022, representing 44 percent of their total income per year; African-American family caregivers spent $6,616 (34 percent); white family caregivers spent $6,964 (14 percent); and Asia-Americans/Pacific Islanders spent $2,935 (9 percent).\n\nNot surprisingly, long-distance family caregivers (defined as those who lived more than an hour away) had the highest out-of-pocket costs at $11,923. Caregivers who shared the same home still faced average costs of about $8,616.\n\nCaregivers\u2019 work lives were compromised, too. More than half of employed caregivers (56 percent) reported at least one work-related stressor, such as working different hours, logging fewer or more hours, and taking time off (both paid and unpaid) for caregiving duties.\n\nThe costs can be tremendous and may drain a caregiver\u2019s own retirement funds and their children\u2019s college savings, said Beth Kallmyer, vice president of constituent services for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nShe said the Alzheimer\u2019s Association reported results from their own caregiver survey earlier this year, finding that half of the people caring for loved ones with\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u00a0are sacrificing their own financial security to do so \u2014 including selling their cars, putting off their own medical care and even cutting back on food to afford caregiving expenses.\n\nKallmyer explained why dementia can be particularly hard on a caregiver\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cAlzheimer\u2019s is more expensive than other chronic diseases because the level of care needed is so significant,\u201d she said. \u201cWith Alzheimer\u2019s, as the disease progresses, the person eventually needs help with all the activities of living \u2014 medications, how to plan for their day, and in the early stages, basic help with initiative. As they move to the middle stages, they need help getting dressed, bathing, shaving, eating and then eventually mobility,\u201d said Kallmyer.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s different for every patient, many with Alzheimer\u2019s can live a long time \u2014 between four and eight years from the time of diagnosis. Some live as long as 20 years.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMost families are not going to be able to pay for this out of pocket, even in the shorter term, for two years,\u201d Kallmyer said.\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s Association recommends families educate themselves early on so they know what they\u2019re facing financially, and learn what resources are available in the community and through the government to help supplement their needs. Consider seeing an elder care attorney and a financial planner, said Kallmyer.\n\nMany families need to access Medicaid in order to pay for services, she added. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association has a 24/7 help line to assist caregivers in talking through financial and other issues.\u00a0\n\nAARP also has more information about resources on its website.\n\nLeaMond said AARP hopes Congress will pass the bipartisan Credit for Caring Act \u2014 which provides a federal tax credit of up to $3,000 \u2014 in order to \u201cgive some sorely needed financial relief to eligible family caregivers.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.11695906519889802, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 757, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.99255644282, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 5, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161115000000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.7556142668428, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dna-heart-disease-lifestyle-helps/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1122]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 699, "scraper_regex": 748}}, "headline": "DNA doesn't doom you to heart disease, experts say", "wordcount_as_scraped": 748, "date": "20161114170000", "story_content": "If your parent or sibling died young from cardiovascular disease, take heart: There are ways you can counter any genetic predisposition to the illness.\n\nNew research shows that people can minimize an inherited risk for heart attack by living right -- exercising, eating healthy, staying slim and quitting smoking.\n\nEven with a little effort in these areas, people can cut their high genetic risk of heart disease by more than half, said senior researcher Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, director of the Center for Human Genetic Research at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\nBut the opposite also is true, Kathiresan warned. People born with a genetic advantage protecting them against heart disease can ruin their good luck through unhealthy lifestyle choices.\n\n\u201cFor heart attack at least, DNA is not destiny,\u201d Kathiresan said. \u201cYou have control over your risk for heart attack, even if you\u2019ve been dealt a bad hand.\u201d\n\nKathiresan presented his findings Sunday at the American Heart Association\u2019s annual meeting, in New Orleans. The study was published simultaneously in the\u00a0New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFor their research, Kathiresan and his colleagues pooled data on more than 55,000 participants in four large-scale health studies.\n\nThe researchers analyzed each person\u2019s genetic risk for heart disease using a panel of 50 gene variants previously associated with elevated heart attack risk.\n\nThey also judged each person\u2019s lifestyle based on four factors: smoking, body weight, diet and exercise.\n\nThe requirements to have a good lifestyle were not rigorous, Kathiresan said. The person essentially had to not smoke, not be obese, get physical activity at least one day a week, and regularly meet at least half of the American Heart Association\u2019s recommendations for a healthy diet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re not being that aggressive in terms of the lifestyle score,\u201d Kathiresan said.\n\nFor example, a person could be overweight, but not obese, and still meet the criteria for a healthy lifestyle in this study, he said. People also didn\u2019t need to meet current U.S. physical activity guidelines, which call for two and a half hours of moderate physical activity or one and a half hours of vigorous physical activity.\n\nEven these minimal lifestyle changes mattered greatly for people at high genetic risk of heart disease.\n\nThe study looked at the risk for a \u201ccoronary event\u201d -- heart attack, cardiac arrest or the need for angioplasty or other procedures to open a blocked artery.\n\nA person with high genetic risk and a bad lifestyle had a nearly 11 percent chance of having a coronary event within the next 10 years, the study found. However, a person at high risk who lived well cut the 10-year risk of such a health crisis down to 5 percent, Kathiresan reported.\n\nLifestyle also mattered for people who won the genetic lottery.\n\nThose with low genetic risk and a good lifestyle had a 3 percent risk of a coronary event over the next 10 years, but a bad lifestyle would drive their risk up to 5.8 percent, Kathiresan said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been dealt a good hand, you could really harm yourself by having an unfavorable lifestyle,\u201d he said. \u201cYou basically take your heart attack rate up into the ranges of the people with the highest genetic risk.\u201d\n\nPatients often ask cardiologists whether they should get genetic testing for their heart health risks, and the doctors usually aren\u2019t keen on it, said Dr. Martha Gulati, division chief of cardiology at the University of Arizona-Phoenix.\n\n\u201cOnce you get those test results, it becomes, \u2018what do you do with them?\u2019 Often you hear from patients, \u2018Now I\u2019m doomed to this disease,\u2019 \u201c said Gulati, who also serves as editor-in-chief of CardioSmart, an online patient education program of the American College of Cardiology. \u201cTheir genetics make them feel very negative and helpless.\u201d\n\nBut this new study shows there is cause for optimism even for those facing the roughest road.\n\n\u201cWe can change this with lifestyle,\u201d Gulati said. \u201cWe always say 80 percent of heart disease is preventable with lifestyle changes. This just gives more evidence; where people at the highest risk of heart disease, there were still things that were modifiable.\u201d\n\nGulati noted that the study does not prove a direct cause-and-effect link between lifestyle and heart health risk, however. She hopes a follow-up clinical trial will be conducted where people are directed in their lifestyle changes, to see how that affects their heart risk.\n\n\u201cThat would be, to me, the next study,\u201d Gulati said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.47957849502563, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 699, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.3868974564, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 9, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114170000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 7, "pct_mft_words": 4.29184549356223, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/atmospheric-river-from-hawaii-pounding-northern-california-threatening-nevada-flooding-snow-rain-stoms/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1978]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 974, "scraper_regex": 1057}}, "headline": "\"Atmospheric river\" from Hawaii pounding Northern California, threatening Nevada", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1057, "date": "20170109100000", "story_content": "Last Updated Jan 9, 2017 8:17 AM EST\n\nRENO, Nev. -- Hundreds of homes were evacuated in northern Nevada and stranded motorists were pulled from cars stuck on flooded Northern California roads as thunderstorms arrived as part of a massive winter storm that could be the biggest to slam the region in more than a decade.\n\nCrews in California cleared trees and debris Sunday following mudslides caused by steady rain accompanying the system that could dump 15 inches in the foothills of the Sierra and heavy snow on mountaintops before, it\u2019s expected, moving east Monday.

With the appointment of Goldman\u2019s second-in-command Gary Cohn as President-elect Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, rather than being run out of town the firm is back riding high.\u00a0\n\nAs the designated director of the National Economic Council, Cohn joins Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman partner who Mr. Trump has nominated as Treasury secretary, in the pantheon of Washington power. The NEC oversees economic policymaking in the White House. That makes Goldman veterans the chief architects of the new administration\u2019s economic initiatives, ranging from tax code overhaul to revamping banking regulation.\u00a0\n\nCohn and Mnuchin are the latest in a long line of high-ranking federal officials from Goldman that stretches back to Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s administration -- and gives rise to the mocking sobriquet Government Sachs.\n\nThe ascension of the two men comes amid a robust run in Goldman\u2019s share price since Election Day. Its stock is the strongest performer in the Dow Jones industrials index starting Nov. 8, up 32 percent and accounting for about a third of the blue-chip benchmark\u2019s record-setting advance, according to the Bespoke Investment Group.\u00a0\n\nGoldman\u2019s strength in helping hedge funds\u2019 trading and in merger advisory work could power its bottom line mightily in the future, analysts say. Many of them expect merger activity to expand under a Trump administration less enamored of antitrust enforcement than its predecessor.\n\n\u201cEven though Goldman symbolizes everything that has gone wrong with Wall Street, they are a survivor,\u201d said Christopher Whalen, head of research for the Kroll Bond Rating Agency and a longtime student of investment banks.\u00a0\n\nIn the wake of the financial crisis, Goldman found itself pilloried. In 2011, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations\u00a0castigated the firm for promoting questionable mortgage-backed securities and then placing negative bets against the mortgage market. The investment bank paid $5 billion to settle Justice Department charges it had sold shoddy mortgage products and another $550 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission action.\n\nIn a scathing 2009 article in Rolling Stone magazine, author\u00a0Matt Taibbi\u00a0decried Goldman\u2019s power and ubiquity, writing: \u201cThe world\u2019s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.\u201d\n\nDuring the past election year, Mr. Trump used Goldman as his main whipping boy amid diatribes against Wall Street for sapping working Americans\u2019 wealth. One Trump campaign TV ad, which criticized \u201ca global power structure\u201d that has \u201crobbed our working class,\u201d showed a picture of Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein. As a candidate, Mr. Trump also slammed Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for earning large sums from speeches at Goldman events.\n\nSo Mr. Trump\u2019s hiring choices have opened him up to charges of hypocrisy. As Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, put it: \u201cTrump talked about the rigged system. It is a recipe for maintaining that rigged status quo.\u201d His organization calls for tighter regulations on the financial companies. Neither the Trump transition team nor Goldman responded to requests for comment. \u00a0\n\nBut now all is apparently forgiven for Goldman. Mr. Trump famously said he wanted to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington of cozy insider connections and conflicts of interest. On the other hand, his embrace of two Goldman guys (there\u2019s actually a third, if you count the incoming White House top strategist, Stephen Bannon, a Goldman alum who since has turned harshly against Wall Street) has an upside for Mr. Trump.\u00a0\n\nIt likely reflects his desire to surround himself with, as he once put it, \u201cthe best people\u201d for key jobs. No one denies that Mnuchin and Cohn are very knowledgeable and accomplished.\n\nIn naming 26-year Goldman veteran Cohn to the NEC post, Mr. Trump homed in on his expertise: \u201cHe fully understands the economy and will use all of his vast knowledge and experience to make sure the American people start winning again.\u201d The Senate must confirm Mnuchin as Treasury head, but Cohn\u2019s NEC appointment doesn\u2019t require its approval.\u00a0\n\nPersonal considerations may have played a role in Mr. Trump\u2019s picks of his top two economic lieutenants. Mnuchin, who left Goldman in 2002 after 17 years to run a hedge fund and then a bank, served as the Trump campaign finance chairman, but Cohn played no role in the election, and is a registered Democrat who has given to both parties. Still, both men are good friends with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and a close adviser.\u00a0\n\nFor certain, the president-elect\u2019s turning to Goldman for high-level hires is part of a storied tradition of the investment bank\u2019s people populating the halls of Washington power. \u201cGoldman is the most political firm on Wall Street,\u201d Kroll\u2019s Whalen said.\u00a0\n\nAlthough Goldman\u2019s political action committee gives about $ 1 million yearly to election campaigns, which isn\u2019t a lot, the wellspring of its influence is the diaspora of Goldman-ites to government positions. Government officials from the firm make a point of hiring other Goldman people in Washington. Although Goldman is far from alone among Wall Street firms in nabbing top federal jobs, it arguably has the most extensive representation.\n\nThat phenomenon began during World War II, when Goldman\u2019s chairman at the time, Sidney Weinberg, ran FDR\u2019s war production board. After the war, Weinberg returned to the firm and used all the connections he had made in Corporate America to lure new business.\u00a0\n\nFlash forward to recent times, and the the Goldman-government roster has swelled remarkably.\u00a0\n\nDuring the Clinton administration, Goldman\u2019s co-chief operating officer Robert Rubin was Treasury secretary. Under George W. Bush, Goldman CEO Henry Paulson headed the Treasury Department. In the Barack Obama era, Goldman partner Gary Gensler served as undersecretary of the Treasury and then head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nGoldman alumni these days also are found peppered throughout the Federal Reserve. Neel Kashkari, who was in investment banking at Goldman and worked for Paulson at Treasury where he ran the bank bailout program, became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis a year ago. That brings to four the roster of Goldman alums heading Fed regional banks, including William Dudley in New York, Robert Kaplan in Dallas and Patrick Harker in Philadelphia.\u00a0\n\nWhether Rolling Stone was right in its florid comparison of Goldman to \u00a0a vampire squid, another sea creature is surely apt when describing the firm\u2019s reach in government: an octopus.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.5357142686843871, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1037, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.8108408788599997, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.0250723240115702, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rachel-freier-trailblazing-hasidic-woman-judge-from-new-york-dont-give-up/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1881]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 665, "scraper_regex": 702}}, "headline": "Trailblazing Hasidic woman judge from New York: \"Don\u2019t give up\"", "wordcount_as_scraped": 702, "date": "20170103030000", "story_content": "NEW YORK -- In some ways, Rachel Freier has a background that might be expected in a new civil court judge. She is a real estate lawyer who volunteers in family court and in her community, where she even serves as a paramedic. But Freier starts work Tuesday as something quite unexpected. She\u2019s believed to be the first woman from Judaism\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Hasidic community to be elected as a judge in the United States. A proud product of a world with strict customs concerning gender roles and modesty, the new Brooklyn civil court judge started college as a married, 30-year-old mother of three children and had three more before graduating. A pathbreaker who embraces tradition, she has sometimes had to explain herself to both outsiders and fellow believers. \u201cMy commitment to the public and my commitment to my religion and my community - the two can go hand in hand,\u201d she says. At a swearing-in ceremony last month, she both vowed to uphold the Constitution and pledged to illuminate the Hasidic world for her new colleagues. \u201cThis is a dream,\u201d she told the gathering. \u201cIt\u2019s the American dream.\u201d There\u2019s no official tally of American judges\u2019 religions, but experts aren\u2019t aware of any Hasidic woman before Freier winning a judicial post. It is extremely rare even in Israel for Hasidic or other ultra-Orthodox women to hold any elected position. Freier, a political newcomer whose uncle is a former judge, won a three-way Democratic primary and the general election in a swath of Brooklyn that includes the heavily Hasidic Borough Park neighborhood. Her election is \u201ca step for the ultra-Orthodox community at large,\u201d showing it\u2019s open to women making progress on the political ladder, said Yossi Gestetner, a longtime Hasidic political activist and public relations consultant who co-managed Freier\u2019s campaign.\u00a0\n\nHasids and other ultra-Orthodox groups together make up only 6 percent of America\u2019s estimated 5.3 million adult Jews, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study. Dating to 18th-century Eastern Europe, Hasidism combines stringent adherence to Jewish law and a joyful belief in mysticism. Followers often speak Yiddish, wear traditional dress including beards and sidelocks for men and wigs for married women, and separate men and women in contexts ranging from buses to classrooms. \u201cThe very idea that an ultra-Orthodox woman could be a judge\u201d is notable, said Samuel Heilman, a City University of New York sociology professor who studies Orthodox Judaism. Under the strictest interpretations of Jewish law, women can\u2019t be judges or largely even witnesses in the rabbinical courts that weigh various disputes in Orthodox communities. (Freier notes that her new post is separate from those tribunals.) Freier, 51, nicknamed Ruchie, started working as a legal secretary after high school. College wasn\u2019t customary for Hasidic women, though it has since become more common. But when her husband, David, got a college degree, she aspired to one of her own. After graduating from a women-only, Orthodox Jewish-friendly program at private Touro College, she went on to Brooklyn Law School, finishing in 2005. Some other Hasidic Jews questioned what she was doing. But they came to realize \u201cI was completely devoted to our religion and our tradition, and this was something I wanted to do regardless,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ever be considered someone who was turning away from my community,\u201d but rather to work within its structure, she said. That has sometimes required finding creative ways to resolve issues. An appeal for help from boys who had chafed in Orthodox Jewish schools, for example, led Freier to found a program that helps young men get general-equivalency diplomas. Then Freier was enlisted to represent Orthodox Jewish women who wanted to join an all-male volunteer ambulance corps, aiming to aid fellow women during childbirth or gynecological emergencies. After ambulance corps leaders rebuffed the idea, which a well-known Orthodox Jewish blog called a \u201cnew radical feminist agenda,\u201d Freier helped the women launch their own volunteer service and joined it herself. She was still taking her turn on call this past week. If there\u2019s a message she hopes her election sends, it\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t give up.\u201d \u201cAnd don\u2019t let go of your standards.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.3698630332946797, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 665, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.14098746022, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170103030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.06015037593985, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chattanooga-school-bus-crash-mother-jasmine-mateen-driver-johnthony-walker-asked-children-if-they-were-ready-to-die/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [221, 375, 604, 669, 811, 1078, 1400, 1849, 1888, 1950, 3828, 4580]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 723, "scraper_regex": 932}}, "headline": "Chattanooga bus crash: Mom of victims says driver asked kids if they were ready to die", "wordcount_as_scraped": 932, "date": "20161122200000", "story_content": "Last Updated Nov 22, 2016 4:57 PM EST\n\nCHATTANOOGA, Tenn. - A school bus driver charged with vehicular homicide in a crash in Tennessee\u00a0asked the children if they were ready to die, according to the mother of three kids who were aboard the bus. One of her children was among the five dead.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy daughter said right before the bus flipped that he was speeding around the curve and asked them \u2018Are y\u2019all ready to die,\u2019\u201dJasmine Mateen told CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann. Mateen\u2019s 6-year-old daughter was killed.\u00a0\n\nOfficials have not confirmed or commented on Mateen\u2019s account.\u00a0\n\nMateen also said she had complained repeatedly since August about the behavior of driver Johnthony Walker before the accident, to no avail.\u00a0\n\nGunevere Cook, Walker\u2019s mother, told CBS News her family was saddened by news of the fatal crash and extended their condolences to the families of the victims, but said her son doesn\u2019t drink or do drugs. She never heard of any complaints against her son\u2019s driving.\u00a0\n\nJohnthony Walker, 24, is being charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment, and reckless driving over the accident. In court papers, police said Walker was driving well over the posted 30 mph limit when he lost control of the bus. He was jailed on $107,500 bail for a court appearance Nov. 29.\u00a0\n\nWalker appeared to have no criminal record in Tennessee, state and local authorities said.\n\nMateen said the daughter who passed was sitting next to another of her children, and claims to have seen the child \u201csmushed\u201d between seats after the crash. The daughter who survived said after the crash repeatedly, \u201cI miss her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m angry. I\u2019m hurt,\u201d Mateen said, adding that her deceased daughter wanted to be a doctor.\n\nOne student who was on the bus\u00a0told CBS Chattanooga affiliate WDEF-TV\u00a0the driver \u201cwasn\u2019t paying attention and was going real fast.\u201d\u00a0\n\nOther parents say they complained about the driver in the past. Craig Harris, a parent of two children who were on the bus, told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that the bus driver sometimes drove too fast.\n\n\u201cThere has been times where I\u2019ve seen him going a little faster than he probably should be going,\u201d Harris said. He said his daughter and stepson were in shock and pain after the crash.\n\nOfficials say he was apparently speeding along a narrow, winding road when he wrapped his vehicle around a tree. The bus was carrying 35 children from Woodmore Elementary School, authorities said. The students in kindergarten through fifth grade, when it crashed about 3:30 p.m., turned on its side and wrapped around a tree.\n\nThe wreck Monday afternoon plunged the city of Chattanooga into mourning, with parents stricken by the news and people lining up to donate blood.\n\n\u201cThe most unnatural thing in the world is for a parent to mourn the loss of a child,\u201d Mayor Andy Berke said. \u201cThere are no words that can bring comfort to a mother or a father. So today, the city is praying for these families.\u201d\n\nEmergency crews needed almost two hours to get all the youngsters off the bus. Bloodied children lay on stretchers, while others walked away dazed with their parents. More than 20 injured students were taken to the hospital, police said.\n\nTwelve remained hospitalized Tuesday, six in intensive care, said Kirk Kelly, interim school superintendent.\n\nThree of the children killed were in fourth grade, one was in first grade and another in kindergarten, Kelly said. Their families were notified, but their names were not released.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board sent a team to investigate, and police obtained a warrant to remove the bus\u2019 black box, which contains data on the vehicle\u2019s movements.\n\nWalker was employed by an outside bus contractor, Durham School Services.\u00a0\n\nWalker had an accident involving property damage in September, and his license was suspended for about a month in 2014 for failure to show proof of insurance, according to state commercial driver records. He appeared to have no criminal record in Tennessee, authorities said.\n\nHamilton County School District spokeswoman Amy Kutcher declined to say whether the district had received any complaints involving Walker, who was employed by an outside bus contractor, Durham School Services. She referred all questions about his performance and that of other Durham drivers to the company.\n\n\u201cLegally there is no way that we could discipline someone who is not our employee,\u201d Kutcher said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 192 Durham bus drivers. Obviously, this is a bad one.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDavid A. Duke, the CEO Durham School Services, issued a statement on Twitter saying the company was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the accident and is working with police and school officials to investigate.\n\nNTSB chairman Christopher A. Hart said investigators will focus first on gathering witness accounts and other evidence. He said investigators would also check on whether the bus had cameras.\n\nDemetrius Jenkins said he had yet to tell his first-grade son, Jermaine Bradley, that the boy\u2019s best friend had died in the crash. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. He\u2019s going to eventually find out,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI know he\u2019s going to be full of tears.\u201d \n\nCounselors were on hand for the students and staff as classes resumed at the elementary school. Pastor Tavner Smith and a dozen staffers of the Venue Church went to offer support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou send your kids to school and think you\u2019re going to see them that evening.

With his final offer of clemency, Mr. Obama brought his total number of commutations granted to 1,715, more than any other president in U.S. history, the White House said. During his presidency Mr. Obama ordered free 568 inmates who had been sentenced to life in prison.\u00a0\n\nThis is also the most commutation grants ever in a single day. In addition to granting more commutations than any president in U.S. history, he has now granted more than the past 13 presidents combined. \u00a0\n\n\u201cHe wanted to do it. He wanted the opportunity to look at as many as he could to provide relief,\u201d Neil Eggleston, Obama\u2019s White House counsel, said in an interview in his West Wing office. \u201cHe saw the injustice of the sentences that were imposed in many situations, and he has a strong view that people deserve as second chance.\u201d\u00a0\n\nFor Mr. Obama, it was the last time he exercised his presidential powers in any significant way. At noon on Friday, Obama will stand with President-elect Donald Trump as his successor is sworn in and Mr. Obama\u2019s chapter in history comes to an end. Even as Mr. Obama issued the commutations, the White House had been mostly cleared out to make way for Mr. Trump. In between carrying out their last duties, the few remaining staffers were packing up belongings as photos of Mr. Obama were taken down from the walls of the West Wing corridors.\u00a0\n\nProud to make this one of my final actions as President.

Mr. Obama repeatedly called on Congress to pass a broader criminal justice fix, but lawmakers never acted. For Bernard Smith, it\u2019s a long-awaited chance to start over after 13 years away from his wife and children. Smith was working at a restaurant in Maryland in 2002 when his brother asked him to obtain marijuana for a drug deal. Though it was his brother who obtained the crack cocaine that the brothers then sold along with the marijuana to undercover officers, Smith was charged with the cocaine offense, too. His 22-year sentence was far longer than his brother\u2019s, owing to what the court called Smith\u2019s \u201cextensive criminal history\u201d prior to the drug bust. Smith still had 10 years on his sentence when he was notified Thursday that the president, on his last day in office, was giving him another chance. \u201cHe\u2019s looking to turn his life around,\u201d said Michelle Curth, his attorney. \u201cHe\u2019s a good person who, like so many people, got involved in something he\u2019s been punished for already.\u201d Curth said that Smith had learned his lesson and owned up to his crime - he asked for a commutation, she noted, not a pardon, which would have erased the original conviction. She said Smith hopes to get licensed in heating and air conditioning maintenance and has lined up family members to help with his adjustment. But freedom for Smith is still two years away. Rather than release him immediately, Mr. Obama directed that he be set free in January 2019 -- two years after Mr. Obama has left office -- and only if Smith enrolls in a residential drug treatment program. To be eligible for a commutation under Mr. Obama\u2019s initiative, inmates had to have behaved well in prison and already served 10 years, although some exceptions to the 10-year rule were granted. They also had to be considered nonviolent offenders, although many were charged with firearms violations in relation to their drug crimes.\u00a0\n\nMr. Obama personally reviewed the case of every inmate who received a commutation, often poring over case files in the evenings or calling his attorneys into his office to discuss specifics. Although a backlog of cases remains as Mr. Obama leaves office, his administration reviewed all applications that came in by an end-of-August deadline, officials said. Eggleston said Mr. Obama had been particularly motivated to grant clemency to inmates who had turned themselves around in prison. He said one inmate had trained and obtained a commercial driver\u2019s license through a prison program, despite having a life sentence that all but assured he\u2019d never get to use it. \u201cThe ones who really stuck home for the president and me are the ones who got their GED, they worked, they took courses in anger management, they took courses in getting over drug abuse issues, they remained in contract with their families,\u201d Eggleston said. Mr. Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With Obama\u2019s support, the Justice Department in recent years directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Earlier in the week, Mr. Obama commuted most of the rest of convicted leaker Chelsea Manning\u2019s sentence, arguing the Army intelligence analyst had shown remorse and already served a long sentence. Yet Mr. Obama will leave office without granting commutations or pardons to other prominent offenders who had sought clemency, including accused Army deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. He also declined to pardon former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.78947377204895, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 873, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 7, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.9284730396, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170119220000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.4054982817869397, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kerry-us-russia-studying-ways-to-halt-aleppo-fighting-syria/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [264, 1250, 2291], "\u00bd": [730]}}, "headline": "Kerry: US, Russia studying ways to halt Aleppo fighting", "wordcount_as_scraped": 616, "date": "20161202210000", "story_content": "ROME -- The United States and Russia are studying new ways to break a months-long diplomatic deadlock over how to stop the fighting in the Syrian city of Aleppo, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday.\u00a0\n\nKerry said the \u201cideas\u201d will be tested in follow-up discussions between American and Russian diplomats next week. Kerry would only describe those fresh approaches as designed to lead to talks between Syria\u2019s government and rebels, a goal that has remained elusive since early 2014, while stressing that the U.S. and Russia won\u2019t wait for Donald Trump\u2019s presidency to begin on Jan. 20.\n\nBut given the repeated failures of the former Cold War foes to halt Syria\u2019s 5 \u00bd-year civil war, it is unclear how much hope the new effort holds. \u201cWe have exchanged a set of ideas, which there will be a meeting on early next week in Geneva, and we have to wait and see whether those ideas have any legs to them,\u201d Kerry said after meeting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Rome. \u201cI will say that both sides understand the importance of trying to continue the diplomacy and trying to see if something can be done. Nobody is waiting for the next administration. We both feel there is urgency.\u201d\u00a0\n\nKerry said he will gauge progress with Lavrov when they meet again on the sidelines of a European security conference in Hamburg, Germany, on Wednesday. \u201cNobody is resigned to the violence,\u201d the American said at a news conference later in the day. While the talks were going on, Syria showed off its recent gains in Aleppo, once the country\u2019s largest city and commercial center. State media reported Friday from areas captured this week in a Russian-backed ground offensive, airing reports of roads being restored, debris removed and civilians resettled. The U.N. aid agency said an estimated 31,500 people have been displaced as a result of the recent fighting, which takes Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s government closer to capturing the whole city and completing what would be perhaps a devastating blow to U.S.-backed rebel forces. The war has killed as many as half a million people since 2011, contributed to Europe\u2019s worst refugee crisis since World War II and allowed the Islamic State group to emerge as a global terror threat.\u00a0\n\nFriday\u2019s diplomatic discussions took place in a hotel several stories above an Italian-hosted conference on the Mediterranean region, and Russia\u2019s Lavrov emphasized that his country won\u2019t allow Syria to follow the example of lawless Libya after NATO\u2019s 2011 intervention that helped topple dictator Muammar Qaddafi. That country now is experiencing perhaps its worst violence in two years as rival militias and extremist groups such as IS continue to vie for power. While Washington has accused Moscow of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria, Lavrov blamed both the U.S. and United Nations for the current situation. He lamented that the U.S. has been unable to fulfill its commitment under several past cease-fire plans to separate the so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d opposition groups from the al-Qaeda-linked fighters that Russia says it is targeting. And he questioned why the U.N. isn\u2019t restarting peace talks or rushing aid to areas of Syria in need, something the global body has been extremely reticent to do since a September convoy was hit by an airstrike. The U.S. has blamed Russia for that attack, a charge Moscow denies. \u201cThe time is ripe for compromise,\u201d Lavrov said. Both diplomats met Friday with the U.N.\u2019s envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura. As de Mistura began his meeting with Kerry, reporters could hear the peace mediator telling the U.S. secretary of state, \u201cAnything but stalemate.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.03715181350708, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 591, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 13, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.7195040991800004, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.23011844331641, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/states-where-the-drivers-are-most-dangerous/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 585, "scraper_regex": 649}}, "headline": "States where the drivers are most dangerous", "wordcount_as_scraped": 649, "date": "20161208110000", "story_content": "Your holiday road trip is underway. You\u2019ve already navigated the overcrowded I-95 corridor from New York to Washington. Or you\u2019ve pulled out of the parking lot of Southern California\u2019s freeways, where motorcycles do a balancing act down the white line at 70 miles per hour. But it\u2019s not time to breathe a sigh of relief, or even believe that you\u2019re safe.\n\nThe Auto Insurance Center (AIC) just completed a study of the deadliest driving conditions by state throughout the U.S. from 2005 to 2015. The insurance news and information website used the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s fatal accident reporting system to reveal the cause of deadly crashes. They include reckless driving, road rage, drunk driving, racing the guy next to you and -- finally -- bad weather. \n\nWhen it comes to careless and reckless driving, wide-open Montana had the greatest death rate, 108 fatalities for every 100,000 residents over those 11 years. Not buckling your seat belt was the most common cause. Arkansas was second with 86 deaths.\n\nConversely, New York and California were among the states with the fewest fatalities per 100,000 -- about two and three respectively. Other safe states were Virginia and Indiana.\n\nHoosiers, however, have a real problem with road rage, with nearly 13 fatalities per 100,000, more than twice as many as the next highest state (South Carolina). Failure to stay in lane caused 93 fatalities in Mississippi and nearly as many in Wyoming.\n\nAs for drunk driving, the High Plains proved to be the Badlands indeed. Wyoming was the worst, with 93 deaths per 100,000, and Montana was a close second with 86. Until 2005, the Big Sky state of Montana actually allowed driving with an open beer can in hand. Although that\u2019s no longer legal, the state \u201chas a strong social trend of drinking and driving,\u201d according to the AIC.\n\nThe third- and fifth-worst  states for drunk driving were North and South Dakota, respectively, with South Carolina wedged in between in fourth place. In contrast, Massachusetts residents were virtual teetotalers, notching only six deaths from intoxication per 100,000 residents. Arkansas had the biggest percentage increase in drunk-driving deaths during the 11 years, with Oregon and Arizona close behind.\n\nDespite all the publicity, laws and organizations aimed at combating drunk driving, 28 people die each day due to crashes involving alcohol, the AIC said.\n\nWhen it comes to speeding and racing, Wyoming and Montana remained consistently at the top, while Alabama was third. Dixie drivers don\u2019t seem to mind racing with police: 2.5 fatalities per 100,000 residents occurred during such a pursuit. And those much-maligned New Jersey drivers were the safest.\n\nWhen it comes to weather, rain is the grim reaper of traffic deaths, killing more people than fog, sleet and snow combined \u2013 even in Alaska.\n\nBut every study has its limitations. The AIC statistics on traffic deaths were culled from 11 years of data that ended as of 2015. So it didn\u2019t calculate the recent surge in traffic accidents and fatalities that took place this year in states like Georgia, which has seen a 22 percent increase in automotive deaths. More people are on the roads -- and driving faster.\n\nDrivers in rural states aren\u2019t necessarily worse than their counterparts in the bumper-hugging Northeast or other urban areas. But speeds are higher there, particularly in areas that increased their speed limits to 85 miles per hour. Plus, they have more pickup trucks on the road, and momentum and mass both factor into vehicular deaths.\n\nAlso, places with lower median incomes tend to not have newer and more expensive vehicles with crash-avoidance features like sensors that detect cars that are too close and autonomous braking. \n\nAnd if crowded states have as many accidents as rural ones, it\u2019s not an accident: Their population density is higher.\n\nSo this holiday season, we should all drive safely -- everywhere.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.804733753204349, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 585, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.4770978917500002, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 11, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.88034188034188, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.0}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-global-warming-transformed-the-earth-in-2016/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00f1": [1328], "\u00a0": [996, 1515, 1929, 2455, 2463, 2538, 2553, 2695, 2716, 2730, 2758, 3037, 3049, 3183, 3198, 3358, 4050, 4340, 4464, 4487, 4501, 4534, 4949]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 823, "scraper_regex": 873}}, "headline": "How climate change transformed the Earth in 2016", "wordcount_as_scraped": 873, "date": "20161227230000", "story_content": "2016 was a milestone year in the continued warming of the planet. From unstable agriculture to the drought in California to melting ice sheets to extreme weather events and heat waves, climate change has disrupted virtually every corner of the world.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to exhaustively list all the ways in which climate change was felt in 2016, but here\u2019s a guide to understanding the year that was for the planet:\n\n\u201cIn the centuries to come, history books will likely look back on September 2016 as a major milestone for the world\u2019s climate,\u201d Brian Kahn of Climate Central wrote earlier this year.\n\nThat\u2019s because, during September, a month in which atmospheric carbon dioxide \u2014 a heat-trapping greenhouse gas \u2014is usually at its lowest, the monthly value failed to drop below 400 parts per million. The 400 ppm mark has sad significance in the climate community, as it has long been considered a point of no return for the atmosphere by scientists.\u00a0\n\nThis year is poised to be the hottest year in the 137-year official record, with global temperatures climbing even higher than record-breaking 2015, according to data released in November from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Temperatures were particularly high in the first half of the year due to the power of El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nThough final data from December is not yet in, January to November 2016 was the warmest such period worldwide on record, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u00a0\n\nIf 2016 ends up with the title of hottest year on record, as expected, that would mean that 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have occurred in this century. The only outlier was 1998, according to the WMO.\n\nStill need perspective? Research released this year shows that, if we take a much longer view of Earth\u2019s temperature history and consider temperature averages in 5,000 year increments, the Earth is now\u00a0warmer than it has been in 120,000 years.\n\nGlobal warming has had a particularly dramatic impact on the Arctic, which has been transformed by significantly warmer temperatures, lower levels of sea ice, and more open water in recent years.\n\nLast month, the average Arctic sea ice extent \u2014 the measurement scientists use to represent the area of ocean where there is at least some sea ice \u2014 was 17.7 percent below the averages from 1981 to 2010, according to NOAA. That\u2019s the lowest November extent since the NOAA began keeping\u00a0records\u00a0in 1979.\n\n\u201cFor the people in the Arctic, no one has to tell them an abrupt\u00a0climate change\u00a0has hit,\u201d Paul Mayewski, professor at the University of Maine\u2019s Climate Change Institute, told CBS News in an interview last week.\n\nContinued\u00a0melting of polar ice\u00a0could lead to\u00a0catastrophic sea level rise\u00a0and flooding on coastlines around the world. Some 13 million Americans could become \u201cclimate refugees\u201d by the end of this century if the worst projections come to pass, one study this year warned.\n\nScientists say human activities are directly linked to Arctic warming: driving a\u00a0gas-powered\u00a0car about 90 miles \u2013 the distance between New York and Philadelphia \u2013 produces enough carbon pollution to melt about a square foot of\u00a0Arctic sea ice\u00a0during the critical month of September, research shows.\n\nThe continued warming of the planet in 2016 is having a destabilizing impact on agriculture worldwide.\u00a0\n\nThose disruptions were particularly felt in coffee production, which supports an estimated 120 million of some of the world\u2019s poorest people in Africa, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nIn the mountains of eastern Uganda, a coffee-rich region, growers struggled to protect their crops \u2014 which require just the right altitude and temperature and the right amounts of rain and sunshine \u2014 from the effects of global warming. Faced with headaches such as new pests and diseases, and beans rendered inedible from too much sunshine, many small-scale family farmers can no longer rely on coffee production to feed their families, pay for medical care, and send their kids to school.\u00a0\n\nExperts project that by the middle of this century, climate change could rule out as much as half of the land now used for coffee production worldwide, CBS News\u2019 Mark Phillips reported in December.\n\nWarming oceans in 2016 caused the largest die-off of corals ever recorded on Australia\u2019s\u00a0Great Barrier Reef, scientists said in November. The reef\u2019s coral cover suffered significant bleaching this year due to the\u00a0El Nino weather effect\u00a0and continued\u00a0climate change.\n\nCoral bleaching\u00a0occurs when unusual environmental conditions, like increased sea temperatures, result in corals expelling the small algae which normally provide oxygen and nutrients. The loss turns the corals white. Reefs can recover if temperatures drop and the algae resettle, but if not, the corals will die.\n\nThis year\u2019s coral die-off was \u201csubstantially worse\u201d than the previous worst-ever event in 1998, Australian scientists\u00a0reported. Experts estimate the Great Barrier Reef has lost 50 percent of its coral cover in the past three decades.\n\nA resilient body, the Great Barrier Reef could regain the corals it\u2019s lost, Australian officials said. But even under good conditions, that could take 10 to 15 years, scientists said, and the acceleration of climate change threatens to derail the natural rhythm of loss and recovery.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.12849164009094, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 823, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.5048132143000001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.2150668286755801, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amid-population-declines-conservationists-sound-alarm-bells-for-the-cheetah/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [923, 2165]}}, "headline": "Amid population declines, conservationists sound alarm bells for the cheetah", "wordcount_as_scraped": 570, "date": "20161226220000", "story_content": "JOHANNESBURG -- Amid population declines for many wildlife species in Africa, conservationists are sounding alarm bells for the cheetah, the fastest animal on land. An estimated 7,100 cheetahs remain in the wild across Africa and in a small area of Iran, and human encroachment has pushed the wide-ranging predator out of 91 percent of its historic habitat, according to a study published on Monday. Consequently, the cheetah should be defined as \u201cendangered\u201d instead of the less serious \u201cvulnerable\u201d on an official watch list of threatened species worldwide, the study said. \u201cThis period is really crunch time for species like cheetah that need these big areas,\u201d said Sarah Durant, a cheetah specialist at the Zoological Society of London and the lead author of the report published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\u00a0\n\nAbout 77 percent of cheetah habitats fall outside wildlife reserves and other protected areas, the study said, requiring outreach to governments and villages to promote tolerance for a carnivore that sometimes hunts livestock. Besides habitat loss, cheetahs face attacks from villagers, loss of antelope and other prey that are killed by people for their meat, an illegal trade in cheetah cubs, the trafficking of cheetah skins and the threat of getting hit by speeding vehicles. A cheetah has been recorded running at a speed of 29 meters (95 feet) per second. The species may move more slowly while hunting and it can only maintain top speeds for a few hundred meters. More than half of the world\u2019s cheetahs live in southern Africa, including in Namibia and Botswana, which have relatively sparse human populations. Cheetahs have been virtually wiped out in Asia, save for fewer than 50 in Iran, according to the study, whose contributors included the Panthera group and the Wildlife Conservation Society. Durant said there was uncertainty over the 7,100 number, which was based on data from experts in areas where cheetahs live and estimates for other areas. Cheetahs are difficult to find because they move over vast regions, she said.\u00a0\n\nDurant also led a previous assessment of nearly 6,700 cheetahs published last year by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which keeps a watch list of threatened species. Since then, experts have provided new information and refined counting methods, contrasting with rough estimates in the 10,000-range in recent decades. The cheetah population in Zimbabwe declined from an estimated 1,500 in 1999 to between 150 and 170, according to a survey conducted between 2013 and 2015 by a group called Cheetah Conservation Project Zimbabwe. The group solicited cheetah photographs and reports of sightings from tourists, safari guides and others and interviewed more than 1,000 people, including village heads and cattle managers. Cheetah experts note that Angola is developing a plan to protect cheetahs and African wild dogs. That could yield better data on cheetah numbers in a country where information has been thin, said Rosemary Groom, a conservationist who participated in an October workshop on the subject in Angola\u2019s Quicama National Park. Despite habitat loss across the continent, the Mara area in southwest Kenya and in the adjacent Serengeti National Park in Tanzania still offers a refuge, said Femke Broekhuis, head of the Mara Cheetah Project. Recent data from a GPS collar on one Mara cheetah showed that it traveled 12 miles overnight, she said.

A new CBS News poll shows what the optimists are most excited about and what most worries those who are concerned or scared about Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0\n\nThirty-six percent of Americans who are at least optimistic about a Trump presidency volunteer an improved economy or bringing back jobs as the thing they are most excited or optimistic about, by far the top choice. \u00a0Other reasons for optimism are the prospect of deporting illegal immigrants (5 percent), making America great again (4 percent), the way Mr. Trump will handle foreign policy (4 percent), bringing change to Washington, (4 percent), and getting rid of Obamacare (4 percent).\n\nFor those concerned with the prospect of a Trump presidency, Mr. Trump\u2019s potential handling of foreign policy and the prospect of starting an international incident or getting the U.S. involved in a war is the top worry (22 percent), followed by his immigration policy 8 percent), his overall temperament and personality (6 percent), that he\u2019ll hurt the economy and job creation (6 percent), bigotry (6 percent), and his lack of qualifications and experience (5 percent).\n\nAmidst concerns from segments of the intelligence community about the role Russia may have played in the 2016 presidential campaign, more than a third of Americans think Donald Trump will be too friendly toward Russia when he becomes president. \u00a0Just 9 percent think he will be too hostile, while nearly half \u2013 48 percent - think his approach will be about right. \u00a0Views are largely partisan: \u00a0eight in 10 Republicans think his approach will be about right and six in 10 Democrats think he will be too friendly toward Russia.\n\nIn comparison, 32 percent of Americans think Mr. Trump will be too hostile toward China, while just 9 percent think he will be too friendly. \u00a0Here again, half think his approach will be about right.\n\nMajorities are confident in Donald Trump\u2019s ability to handle some of the most important issues facing the nation: 61 percent are very or somewhat confident in how he will manage the economy, and 55 percent are confident in how he will deal with the threat of terrorism. About half are confident in his ability to make the right decisions about illegal immigration and foreign policy.\n\nViews are highly partisan; roughly nine in ten Republicans are confident in how the president-elect will manage the economy, terrorism, illegal immigration and foreign policy, while most Democrats are not confident.\n\nAmericans are divided as to whether incidents of racial harassment have become more frequent since Donald Trump won the presidency \u2013 48 percent say they have, 44 percent say there isn\u2019t much difference. But four in five agree that now that he has been elected president, Mr. Trump has a responsibility to condemn incidents of racial harassment that might occur.\n\nDemocrats (66 percent) are far more likely than Republicans (25 percent) to say such incidents have become more frequent.\n\nMajorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents agree that now that he has been elected president, Mr. Trump has the responsibility to condemn these events.\n\nFifty-eight percent of Americans think that the way Mr. Trump conducted his campaign has encouraged racial division; 29 percent think that has had no effect. Views are highly partisan.\n\nThe poll finds mixed views of other specific qualities for the president-elect. Fifty-two percent say Mr. Trump does not share their priorities. Forty-five percent think he will make the U.S. image in the world worse, while 36 percent expect him to improve it. \u00a0There is more agreement about his leadership: six in ten think he has strong leadership qualities. \u00a0Republicans hold much more positive views of Mr. Trump than Democrats.\n\nOverall, just over a third of Americans \u2013 36 percent - say the election of Donald Trump as president makes them feel proud. \u00a0Partisanship affects views: most Republicans feel proud (70 percent), while most Democrats (87 percent) and independents (58 percent) do not.\n\nOverall opinion of Donald Trump remains more negative than positive, though fewer registered voters view him unfavorably than did so right before the election, and more are now saying they are undecided at this point. \u00a0Vice President-elect Mike Pence is viewed more favorably than unfavorably, though more than a third are undecided.\n\nAfter Donald Trump is sworn in as president, the Republican Party will control both the executive and legislative branches of government. Asked, in general, whether it is better to have the president and Congress from the same or different parties, Americans have a slight preference for control of both branches by the same party.\n\nBut as has been the case historically, pragmatism trumps principle here: most Republicans now support same-party control, while Democrats prefer the presidency and Congress be controlled by different parties. \u00a0During Mr. Obama\u2019s second term - when Congress was under Republican control - Republicans wanted the White House and the Congress to be controlled by different parties.\n\nMajorities of Americans describe both major political parties as divided, not united. More view the Republican party as divided --partly because their own rank and file see the party that way. Democrats, despite losing the presidency and their failure to take control of Congress, are more likely to describe their political party as united than Republicans are to say that about theirs.\n\nHalf of Americans now say that, compared to how they have treated other candidates, the news media has been harder in its treatment of Donald Trump. That is up from 40 percent of registered voters in June, before Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee. Republicans are especially likely to say the media has been harder on their candidate.\n\nFew Americans report having a great deal of trust and confidence in the news media to report the news fully, accurately and fairly; just 11 percent say they do. Half have not much or no confidence in the news media; that rises to 68 percent of Republicans. \n\nPresident-elect Trump recently announced that the company Carrier would keep hundreds of jobs in the U.S. instead of moving them to Mexico in exchange for financial incentives. \u00a0More than two in three Americans \u2013 69 percent -- including majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents \u2013 favor a general policy that would provide tax breaks to companies that agree to keep U.S. manufacturing jobs from moving overseas. Twenty-seven percent oppose providing those tax breaks.\n\nForty-eight percent think that trade with other countries loses more jobs for the U.S., while 29 percent think it creates jobs.\n\nRepublicans have said that among the first things they will do after Donald Trump takes office next month is to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u00a0Now, 45 percent approve of the 2010 health care law, and 50 percent disapprove.\n\nStill, just one in ten think the ACA is working well and should be left as it is. Sixty-three percent think there are some good things in the law, but changes are needed, and 25 percent want the law repealed altogether. The percentage that supports repealing the law is down 10 points since January.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s choice for head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, is skeptical that climate change is occurring. \u00a0That contrasts with the public\u2019s views: most Americans think climate change is either affecting the environment now (56 percent) or will do so in the future (23 percent). \u00a0Just 17 percent of the public thinks global warming won\u2019t have a serious impact, and 1 percent thinks it doesn\u2019t exist. \u00a0\n\nThis poll was conducted by telephone December 9-13, 2016 among a random sample of 1,259 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. \n\nThe poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. \n\nInterviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. \n\nThe error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample and the sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly. \n\nThis poll release conforms to the Standards of Disclosure of the National Council on Public Polls.\n\n   CBS News poll toplines - PEOTUS by cbsnews on Scribd", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.133422285318375, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1403, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.04111104925, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 10, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 42, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216000000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.9935851746257995, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/european-far-right-germany-geert-wilders-marine-le-pen/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1649, "scraper_regex": 891}}, "headline": "\"The genie will not go back into the bottle,\" say European far-right after Trump win", "wordcount_as_scraped": 891, "date": "20170122070000", "story_content": "KOBLENZ, Germany -- European nationalist leaders came together Saturday in a show of strength at the start of a year of big election tests, celebrating Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as U.S. president and declaring themselves a realistic alternative to the continent\u2019s governments. Right-wing populist leaders from France, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and elsewhere strode confidently into the Koblenz congress hall on the banks of the Rhine River ahead of a flag-waving escort, setting the tone for a gathering whose mood was buoyed by Trump\u2019s swearing-in. The European parties hope for similar success in tapping anti-establishment and protectionist sentiment in elections this year. \n\n\u201cI believe we are witnessing historic times,\u201d Dutch anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders told reporters. \u201cThe world is changing. America is changing. Europe is changing. And the people start getting in charge again.\u201d Wilders, speaking in English, declared that \u201cthe genie will not go back into the bottle again, whether you like it or not.\u201d The Netherlands will provide the next major test for populist parties\u2019 support. Wilders\u2019 Party of Freedom could win the largest percentage of votes in the March 15 Dutch parliamentary election, even though it is shunned by other parties and unlikely to get a share of power. Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s far-right National Front, is among the top contenders in France\u2019s April-May presidential vote. In September, Frauke Petry\u2019s four-year-old Alternative for Germany party hopes to enter the German parliament in a national election, riding sentiment against German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s welcoming policy toward refugees. Other German parties say they won\u2019t work with the anti-immigrant group. Those at the Koblenz conference Saturday are part of the Europe of Nations and Freedom group in the European Parliament, which was launched in 2015. The gathering also featured Matteo Salvini of Italy\u2019s anti-migrant Northern League and Harald Vilimsky, the general secretary of Austria\u2019s right-wing Freedom Party, which last year narrowly failed to win the country\u2019s presidency. Trump \u201cis a winner, we are winners: Frauke Petry, Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, all of us here are winners,\u201d Vilimsky told an audience of around 1,000. Speakers also denounced \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d and Europe\u2019s common currency, the euro, which Salvini labeled \u201ca failed, criminal experiment.\u201d Le Pen reveled in Trump taking power in the U.S., months after Britain voted to leave the 28-nation European Union in a referendum that she hopes to emulate. \u201c2016 was the year when the Anglo-Saxon world woke up. And 2017, I am sure, will be the year of the awakening of the people of continental Europe,\u201d she said. She denounced the EU as \u201ca force of sterilization\u201d and assailed Merkel - whose name was booed loudly - for allowing in large numbers of asylum-seekers last year. Le Pen praised Trump for what she said was a clear position on Europe: \u201cHe will not support a system of oppression of the people.\u201d \u201cWe are experiencing the end of one world and the birth of another,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are experiencing the return of nation states.\u201d Petry said \u201cjust as Donald Trump in America shows the way out of a dead end, with new prospects - including for (resolving) international conflicts - we want to do that in the coming months and years for Europe.\u201d The leaders sought to portray their focus on nationalist priorities that don\u2019t necessarily converge as a virtue rather than a weakness. Le Pen lauded \u201cthe coherence that we have, above and beyond our differences, which we like.\u201d \u201cBy definition, each of us wants to be the master at home. We want our people to be masters at home, so we don\u2019t want to align ourselves on a single policy for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is exactly what unites us - that is why we are fighting against a European Union that wants to squash us, that wants to eat us all in the same sauce.\u201d Le Pen added that Trump was elected on the back of many of the ideas the European nationalists hold dear, pointing to \u201ccommon accents\u201d with what they have long said in his inauguration speech on Friday. \u201cWe have fought, at first separately in each of our countries and now united, together, a whole series of great values: the nation, control of our borders, the defense of our people, patriotism, sovereignty, the defense of our national identities,\u201d she said. Despite the talk of unity, there is unease among some in the Alternative for Germany party about aligning with Le Pen\u2019s National Front due to her protectionist economic policies, Joerg Meuthen, the AfD\u2019s co-leader, told the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland newspaper group. Some 5,000 demonstrators gathered outside the congress center in Koblenz, singing the European anthem \u201cOde to Joy.\u201d Elsewhere in Koblenz, demonstrators from the global AVAAZ activist group placed statues of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Josef Stalin, among others, in front of a landmark statue of German Kaiser Wilhelm. AVAAZ organizer Pascal Vollenweider said the statues of the dictators were meant to send a \u201cstrong message\u201d to the nationalist politicians\u2019 meeting that \u201cglobal citizens are rejecting their old dangerous ideas.\u201d \u201cThey are not fascists in jackboots, it\u2019s a different type of fascism, of course. But if you look at the ideas ... it\u2019s very dangerous, and we have to face it,\u201d he said.mselves a realistic alternative to the continent\u2019s governments.

The \u201ctax disincentives\u201d of working nine-to-five -- or earning an extra $20,000 at the local McDonalds -- make employment a lost cause. What they\u2019ll see instead is most of that paycheck vanish into the black hole of the IRS, not to mention state and local taxes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re better off staying home and eating macaroni and cheese,\u201d said one of the study\u2019s four authors, Boston University economics professor Laurence Kotlikoff.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue with some of the study\u2019s premises. Boomers who take Social Security early at age 62, rather than the full retirement age of 66 \u2013 or 67 for those born in 1960 or later -- face a huge tax disincentive. For every $2 earned, one is likely to be taken away by a 50 percent marginal (or extra) tax rate on earnings above the recipient\u2019s monthly Social Security check.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one of the many ways the tax code can work against boomers who want to earn additional money. They\u2019ll also encounter higher Medicare taxes and other disincentives, said Kotlikoff. \u201cOlder people can also lose disability benefits if they make too much money.\u201d\n\nWhen the NBER study added up all the different federal programs that apply to boomers, the result was a negative number. \u201cMany, if not most baby boomers appear at risk of suffering a major decline in their living standard in retirement,\u201d said the NBER.\n\n\u201cWith federal and state government finances far too encumbered to significantly raise Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits, boomers must look to their own devices to rescue their retirements, namely working harder and longer,\u201d the study claimed.\n\nDespite advice to the contrary, about 98 percent of seniors take Social Security prior to age 70 -- when they have to and would receive the most money.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone does the wrong thing,\u201d Kotlikoff said. \u201cThey take the Social Security money as soon as possible.\u201d \n\nNot only do they get less, but they face \u201ca plethora of explicit federal and state taxes and implicit taxes arising from the loss of federal and state benefits as one earns more\u201d said the study. That includes Social Security\u2019s complex earnings test and the clawback of disability benefits.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean older Americans are stupid. \u201cMost older workers aren\u2019t privileged and need to retire early, either because they\u2019re fired or laid off, or the work is killing them,\u201d said Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor at the New School in New York City and an adviser to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nOnce \u201cretired,\u201d more than half of retirees find that their savings are inadequate for the 20- to 30-year road ahead and feel as if they\u2019re behind right from the start, according to a study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. They take Social Security because they need it. Then they look for a part-time job to supplement their income. That\u2019s when they get caught in a squeeze. They find that if they\u2019ve already taken the minimal payout from SS, they won\u2019t earn much from a job.\n\n\u201cWorking longer, say an extra five years, can raise older workers\u2019 sustainable living standards,\u201d the NBER study states. \u201cBut the impact is far smaller than suggested in the literature, in large part because of high net taxation.\u201d\n\nSo in many ways, retirement for boomers is a drag. Pensions, which used to support people after they retired, are vanishing, and 401(k) plans and IRAs work only if people invested in them, and wisely. Most didn\u2019t, according to Federal Reserve data, and those who did may have become victims of recession, the need to draw on their plans to survive or simply made the wrong choice of investments. \n\nGhilarducci said the answer is increasing Social Security benefits, reforming the pension system and making 401(k) plans \u201cuniversal and efficient.\u201d\n\nGood luck with that, or with a reform of the tax code, said a New Jersey financial planner whose name was not used for compliance reasons. \u201cThe tax code is like a pinball machine,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing bounces into another. And it would be nice if they raised Social Security, but it\u2019s going broke.\u201d\n\nBut most disheartening is the way many people see their lives ending -- sooner rather than later. \u201cThey\u2019re sure they\u2019re going to die young, which is why they take Social Security early,\u201d Kotlikoff said. \u201cThen they don\u2019t have to pay any bills. Death is financial salvation.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.25281596183777, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 714, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.78288961381, "HarmVirtue": 17, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161104100000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.3613445378151297, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-us-ambassador-israel-david-friedman-embassy-jerusalem-palestinian/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3095]}}, "headline": "Trump's pick for Israel ambassador a contentious one", "wordcount_as_scraped": 632, "date": "20161216150000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump has announced that he will nominate attorney David Friedman as U.S. ambassador to Israel, selecting an envoy who supports Israeli settlements and other changes to U.S. policies in the region. \n\nFriedman said he looked forward to carrying out his duties from \u201cthe U.S. embassy in Israel\u2019s eternal capital, Jerusalem,\u201d even though the embassy is in Tel Aviv.\n\nLike some of his predecessors, Mr. Trump has vowed to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, a politically charged act that would anger Palestinians who want east Jerusalem as part of their sovereign territory. The move would also distance the U.S. from most of the international community, including its closest allies in Western Europe and the Arab world.\n\nThe president-elect said Friedman would \u201cmaintain the special relationship\u201d between the U.S. and Israel.\n\nBut the announcement sparked anger from liberal Jewish groups, and the prominent leader of Islam\u2019s holiest site in Israel said moving the embassy to Jerusalem would amount to a \u201cdeclaration of war.\u201d \n\nJeremy Ben-Ami, the president of liberal Jewish group J Street, called Friedman\u2019s nomination \u201creckless,\u201d citing his support for settlements and his questioning of a two-state solution with the Palestinians.\n\nThe first Palestinian reaction came from Sheikh Ekrema Sabri, imam of the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem -- one of the holiest sites in the world to Sunni Muslims. He said in an interview with the London-based pan-Arab newspaper al-Quds al-Arabi on Friday that moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem would constitute a declaration of war.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe statement from Mr. Trump\u2019s team doesn\u2019t detail how Friedman could work in Jerusalem. However, Trump advisers have insisted in recent days that the president-elect will follow through on his call for moving the embassy.\n\n\u201cHe has made that promise,\u201d Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters Thursday. \u201cI can guarantee you, just generally, he\u2019s a man who is going to accomplish many things very quickly.\u201d\n\nOne option Trump allies have discussed would involve Friedman, if confirmed by the Senate, working out of an existing U.S. consulate in Jerusalem. According to a person who has discussed the plan with Trump advisers, the administration would essentially deem the facility the American embassy by virtue of the ambassador working there.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how far those discussions have gotten or whether Mr. Trump himself has been briefed on the proposal. Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team did not respond to questions about the matter.\n\nBoth Bill Clinton and George W. Bush promised to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, but backed away from the idea once in office.\n\nIsrael captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move that is still not internationally recognized.

He said he claimed his bag, took it to bathroom, loaded it, and put in his waistband.\n\nSantiago, 26, had trouble controlling his anger after serving in Iraq and told his brother that he felt he was being chased and controlled by the CIA through secret online messages. When he told agents at an FBI field office his paranoid thoughts in November, he was evaluated for four days, then released without any follow-up medication or therapy.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe FBI failed there,\u201d Bryan Santiago told The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about someone who emerged from anonymity to do something like this.\u201d Speaking in Spanish outside his family\u2019s house in Penuelas, the brother said: \u201cThe federal government already knew about this for months, they had been evaluating him for a while, but they didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA law enforcement source said when Santiago -- who had been living in Anchorage, Alaska -- walked into the FBI office in November, he had a handgun in his possession, CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton reports. It is not known if the handgun was the 9mm handgun that authorities said Santiago used in the Florida attack on Friday.\u00a0\n\nThe weapon had been taken away when he entered the FBI reception area and was held while he was interviewed by the FBI, Milton reports. When the Anchorage Police Department transported Santiago to the hospital, they took possession of the weapon. The law enforcement source said that apparently the police department returned the weapon to Santiago after he received a medical evaluation.\n\nA U.S. law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CBS News that Santiago had said that his mind was being controlled by the CIA and the U.S. government and that he was being forced to watch videos from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.\n\nThe FBI office in Alaska declined to comment ahead of a Saturday news conference.\n\nThere were other signs of trouble. Santiago was charged in a domestic violence case in January 2016, damaging a door when he forced his way into a bathroom at his girlfriend\u2019s Anchorage home. The woman told officers he yelled at her to leave, choked her and smacked her on the side of the head, according to charging documents.\u00a0\n\nA month later, municipal prosecutors said he violated the conditions of his release when officers found him at her home during a routine check. He told police he had lived there since he was released from custody the previous month. His Anchorage attorney, Max Holmquist, declined to discuss his client. Bryan Santiago said his brother had requested psychological help but barely received any. \u201cI told him to go to church or to seek professional help,\u201d he said. Family members have said Esteban Santiago changed after serving a yearlong tour in Iraq. He was born in New Jersey but moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2, his brother said. He grew up in Penuelas before joining the Guard in 2007. He deployed in 2010 as part of the Puerto Rico National Guard, spending a year with an engineering battalion, according to Guard spokesman Maj. Paul Dahlen. Esteban Santiago\u2019s mother wiped tears from her eyes as she stood inside a screen door Saturday. She said her son had been tremendously affected by seeing a bomb explode near two friends while serving in Iraq.\u00a0\n\nLt. Col. Candis Olmstead, a Guard spokeswoman, told The New York Times that two soldiers in Santiago\u2019s company had died during his stint in Iraq.\n\nFormer neighbor Ursula Candelario in Penuelas recalled seeing Esteban Santiago grow up and said people used to salute him after he joined the Guard. \u201cHe was very peaceful, very educated, very serious,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in shock. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Since returning from Iraq, Santiago served in the Army Reserves and the Alaska National Guard in Anchorage, Olmstead said. He was serving as a combat engineer in the Guard before his discharge for \u201cunsatisfactory performance.\u201d His military rank upon discharge was E3, private 1st class, and he worked one weekend a month with an additional 15 days of training yearly, Olmstead said. She would not elaborate on his discharge. The Pentagon said he went AWOL several times and was demoted and discharged.\n\nWhile it is unclear if Esteban Santiago had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, as many as one in five veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan develop the affliction each year, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. A 2014 Veterans Affairs study found that almost 30 percent of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who sought treatment at VA hospitals were diagnosed with PTSD symptoms.\u00a0\n\nHis uncle and aunt in New Jersey were trying to make sense of what they were hearing about Santiago. FBI agents arrived at their house to question them on Friday. Maria Ruiz told The Record newspaper that her nephew had recently become a father to a son and was struggling. \u201cIt was like he lost his mind,\u201d she said in Spanish of his return from Iraq. \u201cHe said he saw things.\u201d Santiago was flying from Anchorage on a Delta flight and had checked only one piece of luggage, which contained the gun. Sen.-elect Nelson Cruz, who knew the family and represents the town where they live in Puerto Rico, said he had been talking regularly with Bryan Santiago since the shooting. \u201cThey\u2019re very humble and very Christian people,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThey want to tell the families of the victims that they\u2019re extremely saddened and extremely upset by what happened.\u201d ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.6059365272522, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 934, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.46843844634, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170107210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.74732334047109, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/iraq-troops-finds-civilians-hungry-isis-mosul/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 746, "scraper_regex": 790}}, "headline": "Iraqi troops finds civilians left hungry by ISIS in Mosul", "wordcount_as_scraped": 790, "date": "20161115160000", "story_content": "MOSUL, Iraq - Hundreds of Iraqi civilians spilled into the streets Tuesday in eastern Mosul areas recently retaken from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to demand food from the military as rations run low in their neighborhoods, an Iraqi officer said.\n\nAbout 700 residents gathered in three areas of the city\u2019s Zahra and Qadisiya neighborhoods, the latter of which was the scene of a fierce ISIS counterattack a day earlier, said Maj. Salam al-Obeidi.\n\nThe Iraqi troops were sharing what rations they have with the civilians.\n\n\u201cThis is a problem for us because the food we have is not enough for them and we\u2019re waiting for more food to be sent from the government,\u201d al-Obeidi said. \u201cNow the Iraqi soldier is giving his food to the civilians.\u201d\n\nIraq launched a major offensive last month to drive ISIS out of the northern city, the country\u2019s second largest, which is still home to more than one million civilians.\n\nSpecial forces have captured a foothold in the city\u2019s east, and have been advancing slowly over the past week to avoid casualties and civilian deaths as ISIS fighters emerge to attack from the dense, urban landscape, often with armor-plated suicide car bombs.\n\nNear the northeastern Zahra district, explosions and gunfire erupted Tuesday as the special forces advanced. ISIS militants fired mortars on the troops from apartment windows in the al-Samah neighborhood, wounding at least seven civilians when the shells landed in the streets below.\n\nIn a dust-swept open area, the army set up seven beds to treat wounded troops and civilians in a field clinic. Teaming up with foreign volunteers, Iraqi medics administered first aid before sending the wounded to the hospital.\n\nAmong the wounded was 45-year old Ziad Abid Nayef, who was hit by shrapnel from a mortar shell while he was standing in the street, and a seven-year old child.\n\nU.S.-led coalition warplanes flew overhead at low altitude while columns of smoke rose over the city.\n\nThe militants struck back against special forces in Qadisiya a day earlier, Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi said. Two dozen men wearing suicide vests charged the front lines, setting off a three-hour battle that killed 20 militants and severely wounded a special forces soldier.\n\nThe Iraqi armed forces do not release official casualty figures, but field medics have noted dozens of killed and wounded since the operation to liberate the city began on Oct. 17.\n\nSince last week\u2019s quick advance into Mosul proper, Iraqi forces have struggled to hold territory under heavy ISIS counterattacks.\n\nAt a news conference south of Mosul, Interior Ministry spokesman Brig-Gen. Saad Maan said the military has driven ISIS out from over a third of the eastern half of the city, divided by the Tigris River.\n\n\u201cMore than a third of this side has been liberated,\u201d Maan told reporters at the Qayara air base, a main port of entry for forces headed northward to the battle.\n\nCol. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U.S.-led forces supporting the operation, said at the same news conference that airstrikes had so far destroyed 59 suicide car bombs and over 80 tunnels.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to strike the enemy for as long as it takes for the Iraqi flag to be raised over Mosul and every other corner of this country,\u201d he said, adding that the coalition had conducted over 4,000 strikes with air power and artillery since the campaign began.\n\nThe United Nations said smoke from oil wells and a chemical plant torched by ISIS near Mosul has forced over 1,500 people to seek medical treatment for respiratory problems.\n\nThe group\u2019s humanitarian affairs coordination office said the fires have emitted toxic smoke for 25 to 60 days, affecting 14 towns. It said the mid- and long-term effects on people\u2019s health, the environment, agriculture and livelihoods could be serious.\n\nIn late October, ISIS shelled and set fire to the al-Mishraq Sulfur Gas Factory south of Mosul, causing the deaths of at least four people from toxic fumes, the U.N. has said, comparing the attack to the use of chemical weapons.\n\nNearby oil wells set ablaze by ISIS have been burning uncontrollably since June.\n\nMeanwhile in Baghdad, Iraqi officials said bombings in and around the city killed at least 14 people on Tuesday and wounded more than 50.\n\nThe attacks targeted outdoor markets, Shiite pilgrims and anti-ISIS Sunni tribal fighters, police said. Medical officials confirmed the casualty figures. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information.\n\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but they bore the hallmarks of the Islamic State group, which has taken credit for similar bombings.

Ironically, some of those teens, now in their 60s and beyond, may have trouble paying for medications they now need to have a normal love life.\n\nSoaring prices for prescription medicines for impotence and other sexual health problems have put the remedies out of reach for some.\n\nWithout insurance coverage, Viagra and Cialis cost about $50 a pill, triple their 2010 list prices. The new daily pill for women with low sex drive, called Addyi, costs $800 per month. Older\u00a0products for women also have seen huge price run-ups, Truven Health Analytics data show.\n\n\u201cMany of them don\u2019t get past the pharmacy counter once they see the price,\u201d says Sheryl Kingsberg, a University Hospitals-Cleveland Medical Center behavioral psychologist and researcher who counsels men and women.\n\nWhat people actually pay out of pocket varies. Some insurance prescription plans, including Medicare, cover some of the medicines. Some plans don\u2019t cover any, arguing they\u2019re not medically necessary. Many require steep copayments or limit the number of impotence pills per prescription.\n\n\u201cOnce you get to a certain price point, sex becomes a financial decision,\u201d says Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, a sexual dysfunction specialist at New York\u2019s Lenox Hill Hospital. \u201cIt takes a lot of the joy out of this.\u201d\n\nFive of six specialists interviewed by The Associated Press say patients have told them they\u2019ve given up sex because of the cost.\n\nNow, a little relief is coming. Late next year, Viagra and Cialis will get at least one generic competitor costing slightly less; prices will plunge later when more generics reach the market. For women, an Addyi rival is in late-stage testing. A few other products now have generic versions, and other options are in development.\n\nA generation ago, long-married couples accepted their sex lives trailing off with age, Kavaler says. Key hormone levels drop with age, reducing sex drive and causing problems such as impotence and vaginal dryness, which often makes intercourse painful.\n\nToday, midlife divorce is more common, divorced or widowed men and women often seek new partners, and sex becomes important again. Meanwhile, they\u2019re bombarded by ads for impotence remedies and other treatments.\n\n\u201cCouples in their 50s, 60s and 70s are more sexual than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d says Kavaler.\n\nUntil Pfizer launched the first impotence pill, Viagra, in 1998, there were few options for men besides penile implants and injections. Viagra and Cialis each quickly topped $1 billion in global annual sales, and products for women\u2019s symptoms eventually followed. However, price hikes appear to be limiting usage for some products in the U.S., where prices aren\u2019t regulated.\n\nSince 2010, the number of Viagra prescriptions filled in the U.S. has fallen 42 percent to about 5 million a year. Meanwhile, prescriptions for Cialis, which now has a popular daily pill option, have gone up slightly, according to health data firm QuintilesIMS.\n\nPopular women\u2019s estrogen products such as Vagifem vaginal tablets and Estrace cream also have seen prescriptions decline in recent years. Addyi, only on the market for a year, has had dismal sales.\n\nDr. Lauren Streicher offers women four treatment options, and most pick Vagifem. A month\u2019s supply costs $170 and insurance coverage is limited. A generic version, Yuvafem, just launched at a slightly cheaper price.\n\n\u201cThey go to their pharmacy and see how much it costs, and then they call me up and say, \u2018I can\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d says Streicher, director of the Center for Sexual Medicine and Menopause at Northwestern Medicine, in Chicago.\n\nBut not being able to have sex \u201cis a deal-breaker in a lot of relationships,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe drugs\u2019 makers insist list prices far exceed the negotiated prices insurers pay them and say they price products based on their value. According to the companies, nearly all their customers are insured. Pfizer says most insured Viagra users pay $6 to $8 per pill, for instance.\n\nPatients unwilling to forego sex, doctors say, split pills or otherwise ration medicines, beg for scarce samples or seek copay discount coupons. Men with enlarged prostates can request Cialis because it\u2019s also approved for that condition, usually with insurance coverage. Some women make do with over-the-counter lubricants.\n\nMany shop for price, which can vary widely by pharmacy.\n\nOthers take a big risk, buying \u201cherbal Viagra\u201d at gas stations or ordering Viagra online from \u201cCanadian pharmacies\u201d that likely sell counterfeit drugs made in poor countries, says Dr. Irwin Goldstein, director of San Diego Sexual Medicine.\n\nSome doctors have gotten inventive.\n\nDr. Nachum Katlowitz, head of urology at New York\u2019s Staten Island University Hospital, offers an alternative costing about $1 per pill at some pharmacies. The active ingredient in Viagra \u2014 sildenafil \u2014 is also in Pfizer\u2019s now-generic blood pressure pill Revatio but at one-fifth the dose.\n\nOne of his patients, a 62-year-old hospital technician, takes several of the blood pressure pills before sex.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford it if I had to pay for Viagra,\u201d says Robert, who asked that his last name not be used to protect his privacy.\n\nHe\u2019s experienced modest improvements and says he and his wife of 28 years now have sex twice as often.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.7837234735488898, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 802, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.655554777357, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 5, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.6234413965087281, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.45454545454499995}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sheriff-missing-washington-state-family-found-alive/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 541, "scraper_regex": 586}}, "headline": "Missing Washington state family found alive", "wordcount_as_scraped": 586, "date": "20161117230000", "story_content": "SEATTLE -- Hunters found a Washington state couple and two of their children walking along a remote logging road southwest of Seattle on Thursday, two days after they failed to pick up their older kids after school and were reported missing, authorities said.\n\nJason and Melissa McAlister had gone for a drive Tuesday with their 8-month-old and 2-year-old, and got stuck when the road gave way as they tried to maneuver their van around a downed tree north in the rugged country in Mason County.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s good. God\u2019s great. Happy to be alive,\u201d Jason McAlister, 33, told television news crews.\n\n\u201cThis one was a trooper,\u201d he said, referring to his 2-year-old daughter. \u201cShe was rooting around in the van, finding all kinds of Halloween Candy.\u201d\n\nThe family started walking back toward the main road at about 1 p.m. Tuesday, but stopped as darkness fell, he said. He made a shelter along the side of the road by leaning fir boughs against a rock face that protected them from the wind as temperatures dropped into the 30s.\n\n\u201cIt actually kept us warm, considering I didn\u2019t have a fire going,\u201d he said.\n\nMcAlister said he doesn\u2019t smoke, but he usually keeps lighters in his car. Friends who do smoke had borrowed them, he said.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, the family began trekking back to the van, reaching it at 8 a.m. They turned on the heater, tried to dry out their clothes, put on some DVDs and listened to the radio - and learned authorities were looking for them.\n\nAfter spending Wednesday night in the van, they began walking out again on Thursday morning, tearing sheets of paper from a spiral notebook the older kids, ages 5 and 7, had left in the van and leaving them on the ground in wide spots of the road where they might be seen by helicopter crews.\n\nThat\u2019s when the hunters found them, Jason McAlister said. McAlister formerly served as a volunteer firefighter for Cowlitz County, where he also worked search-and-rescue, and he said he was grateful for the efforts of everyone who had been looking for his family.\n\nThe hunters immediately recognized them because of heavy media coverage about the search, said Steve Shumate, chief criminal sheriff\u2019s deputy in neighboring Grays Harbor County, where the family lives. They called 911, drove the family to a general store to meet medics and then led deputies to the family\u2019s van.\n\nIt was an immense relief for authorities, who feared a less happy ending when the family failed to turn up Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe figured if they were going to walk out, that\u2019s when it would have happened,\u201d Shumate said.\n\nThe family\u2019s home is in a rural area southwest of Seattle, about 20 miles north of the town of Montesano. They were reported missing Tuesday evening after no one showed up to meet the school bus bringing the older children home, Shumate said.

He began work January 1, vowing a \u201csurge for peace\u201d and much-needed reform of the bloated bureaucracy at the U.N, a body that\u2019s seen as doing much good, but that\u2019s failed in recent years to resolve the world\u2019s most intractable conflicts.\n\nOn Tuesday, in his first formal appearance as the U.N.\u2019s CEO, he told a packed Security Council chamber, \u201cWe must rebalance our approach to peace and security. For decades, this has been dominated by responding to conflict.\u201d \n\nThe former refugee chief and Portuguese prime minister said the reforms he\u2019s setting in motion will be able to \u201cprevent war and sustain peace.\u201d And, he said, nations must \u201cstrengthen the credibility and authority of the United Nations.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, because of a December Security Council resolution condemning Israeli West Bank settlements, made possible by the abstention of the outgoing Obama administration, a bipartisan group in Congress is considering cutting the U.S. financial contribution to the U.N. Both the House of Representatives and Senate voted to condemn the Council vote. \n\nComplaints about the U.N., including those by President-elect Trump, are not new, but divisions between Moscow and Washington haven\u2019t been as pronounced since the 1970s. That\u2019s created stalemates over some of the largest recent conflicts, including those in Syria and Yemen, and undermined the world body\u2019s credibility. \n\nDuring his address, Guterres appeared to acknowledge some of the frustration with the U.N. \u201cIf there is something that is shocking in today\u2019s world, it is to see such a multiplication of conflicts with dramatic human suffering and the little capacity of the international community to prevent conflicts and to, timely, solve them,\u201d he said.\n\nGuterres also appeared to blame many \u2013 including members of the press -- for not seeing where the U.N. does succeed, such as with poverty eradication, education, or imposing stinging sanctions on North Korea. \u201cTV cameras are not there where a crisis is avoided,\u201d the new Secretary General told reporters on his way into his address.\n\nIn a wide ranging one-on-one exit interview with CBS News, now former Secretary General Ban Ki-moon talked about the important role of the U.N. and the International Atomic Energy Agency in counterterrorism: \u201cAt a time when we are seeing daily terrorist attacks and the spread of violent extremism, it is important for the international community to make sure that any nuclear material or any weapons should be fully safeguarded so that there will be no smuggling out or smuggling into any country; once nuclear materials are in the hands of a terrorist, it will be extremely difficult and dangerous for international peace and security.\u201d \n\nOutgoing U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power, in one of her last addresses to the body, offered similar observations, saying the Security Council matters because 100,000 troops are deployed worldwide under its auspices, and because it authorizes the use of force and delivers life-saving humanitarian aid. Power said, \u201cWe help set the rules for how states should behave.\u201d\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s role today is significant: It has a staff of 44,000, not including 104,000 peacekeeping troops, and is responsible, in theory, for issues from world peace and refugees to pandemics and climate change. \n\nThe U.S. role is significant, in part because its contribution is the largest of any nation. The U.S. provides 22 percent of the regular budget ($5.4 billion) and 28.5 percent of the peacekeeping budget ($8.27 billion).\n\nDespite a bruising election season marked by sharp divisions over trade and foreign policy, a January poll conducted by a bipartisan research group found that 88 percent of Americans believe it\u2019s important for the U.S. to maintain an active role at the U.N. \n\nThe President-elect\u2019s ambassador-designate to the U.N. is South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Her confirmation hearings are tentatively set for January 18. \n\nMore to the point, the U.S. gets to take the helm of the Security Council in April, because of a monthly rotation of the council\u2019s presidency, and that may provide an opportunity for the Trump administration to set the U.N. agenda.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.27882027626038, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 662, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.74994562822, "HarmVirtue": 13, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.438066465256799, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/turning-the-page-donald-trumps-first-day-in-office/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4069, 4071, 4073, 4074]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 625, "scraper_regex": 677}}, "headline": "Turning the page: Donald Trump\u2019s first day in office", "wordcount_as_scraped": 677, "date": "20170122150000", "story_content": "THE NEXT CHAPTER in American history is playing out before our eyes. It began Friday on the Capitol steps with the inauguration of President Trump, and it continued yesterday on the streets of Washington and other cities around the country and the world. Chip Reid reports on one part of our Cover Story:  \n\n\u201cI do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. So help me God.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, January 20th at noon, Donald John Trump took the oath of office to become the 45th President of the United States. \n\nAfter a sometimes brutal campaign and a bumpy transition, there was a sense of unity as four out of five former presidents joined the new president to complete the peaceful transition of power.\n\nBut in his inaugural address, President Trump took a surprisingly defiant tone, even castigating some of those sitting directly behind him.\n\n\u201cFor too long, a small group in our nation\u2019s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. ... This moment is your moment, it belongs to you. January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.\u201d\n\nIt was a populist call to arms that, at times, painted a dark picture of today\u2019s America.\n\n\u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. ... mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, Leo Ribuffo, a professor of American history at George Washington University, said, \u201cMy immediate reaction was, that\u2019s Trump -- a calmer Trump, a complete sentences Trump, but that\u2019s Trump.\n\n\u201cSince Thomas Jefferson, off and on, there has been an emphasis on conciliation, national unity. There was much less of that than usual [in Trump\u2019s speech]. He\u2019s speaking to his men and women, to his base mostly.\u201d\n\nAfter the ceremony, President Trump and new first lady Melania Trump escorted former President Obama and his wife, Michelle, to a waiting helicopter, where the Obamas said goodbye, before heading off for a vacation and a new life outside of the spotlight.\n\nIn his first order of business as president, Mr. Trump signed a few executive orders in the ornate President\u2019s Room in the Capitol. \n\nAnd in his first act as commander-in-chief, the president reviewed the troops from the Capitol steps. \n\nAs tradition dictates, the president, vice president and their families then proceeded down Pennsylvania Avenue for the inaugural parade -- and along with the cheers, there were boos. \n\nJust blocks away, large crowds of protesters loudly voiced their displeasure. Some smashed storefront windows, set fires, and even fought with police.\n\nAdd to that yesterday\u2019s Womens March on Washington.\n\nReid asked, \u201cIs there anything like these protests in the history of inaugurations?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been no protests on this scale in the history of presidential inaugurations,\u201d Ribuffo replied. \u201cNone on this scale. On the other hand, nobody threw bottles or rocks at the presidential limo as they did with Nixon. But in terms of scale, this is absolutely unprecedented.\u201d\n\nOn a positive note, the predicted rain never showed up, and as darkness fell Friday, the first family watched as thousands paraded by, from every corner of the nation.\n\nFriday evening, the president and first lady celebrated at three inaugural balls, dancing to \u201cMy Way\u201d -- a fitting song for a man who from the start has promised to do everything his way. \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0For more info: ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.8746355772018429, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 625, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.221158824090001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170122150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.52, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-paying-the-rent-means-going-hungry/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [331, 762, 1128, 1771, 2063, 2184, 2819, 3511, 4109, 4607, 4971, 5150]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 693, "scraper_regex": 826}}, "headline": "When paying the rent means going hungry", "wordcount_as_scraped": 826, "date": "20161227190000", "story_content": "Last Updated Dec 27, 2016 4:05 PM EST\n\nIt is a sign of the uneven economic terrain impeding the recovery: Although U.S. consumer confidence is at its highest level in 15 years, a combination of stagnant wages and surging housing costs are leaving millions of people scrambling to afford food.\u00a0\n\nForty-one percent of cities surveyed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported an increase in demand for emergency food assistance. More than half of the Americans applying for emergency food are employed, while only 8 percent were homeless, the study found. The cities with the biggest increases include Des Moines, Iowa, where the number of requests for food help jumped 15 percent, and San Francisco, where it rose 3 percent.\u00a0\n\nThe culprit is the impact of two intersecting trends that is spelling trouble for many working families: slow wage growth in the post-recession years as well as sharply higher rents. In 2013, one of four renters paid half their incomes toward rent, a trend that\u2019s projected by Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies to only worsen over the next several years.\u00a0\n\nThe increase in hungry Americans means that many food pantries and emergency kitchens have had to cut back in the size of servings they can provide, the Conference of Mayors found.\n\n\u201cIt is concerning that even people who are employed continue to need the help of food pantries to make ends meet,\u201d said Tom Cochran, the executive director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said in a statement.\n\nAbout one-third of cities reported their emergency food kitchens and pantries had reduced the number of times families or individuals could visit each month, while 47 percent of cities said they had to turn people away or cut back their portions.\u00a0\n\nAs 2016 draws to a close, food pantries around the country are reporting declining donations, although the cause isn\u2019t due to less charitable individuals. Supermarkets, which have historically been among the biggest food donors, have become more efficient thanks to computer networks. That\u00a0has reduced the amount of surplus food they have on hand to donate to food shelves, according to The Providence Journal.\u00a0\n\nAt the same time, spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, has declined after the 2013 expiration of a benefit increase tied to the Recovery Act. The number of households getting aid under the federal program remains above pre-recession levels, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington think tank.\n\nMore cuts to food stamps could be coming. House Republicans want to overhaul the SNAP program, with The Associated Press reporting that the GOP may seek to strengthen work requirements or tighten eligibility, which could strike some food stamp recipients from the rolls.\u00a0\n\nRenters need to earn at least $20.30 per hour to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment in the U.S., according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Its 2016 report on housing affordability noted that hourly wages for workers in the bottom 10 percent of the income distribution rose just 0.2 percent from 2007 to 2015, while the top 5 percent saw income growth of 8.7 percent over that time.\n\nMeanwhile, the amount of affordable housing hasn\u2019t kept up with demand, the NLIHC found. The number of apartments around the U.S. that rent for less than $400 increased by 10 percent from 2003 to 2013, and the number of households who needed these low-cost apartments jumped by 40 percent.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis burden makes it difficult to afford other basic necessities like healthy food and medication and to save for financial emergencies,\u201d the NLIHC said.\n\nAn analysis of household expenditures by The Pew Charitable Trusts found that many middle- and low-income American households are now caught in a financial stranglehold. Costs for essentials such as housing, food and transportation have surged over the last two decades, while income hasn\u2019t kept up. Its study found that low-income Americans end up in a financial hole of $2,300 on average because basic costs are outpacing typical income.\u00a0\n\nInterestingly, it\u2019s not necessarily the most expensive U.S. cities where families face the greatest rent burden. The three cities where residents are paying the greatest portion of their income in rent are Hialeah, Florida (57 percent); Detroit, Michigan (48 percent) and Miami, Florida (48 percent), according to a December analysis of Census data from RentCafe. Because workers in expensive cities such as San Francisco tend to earn higher wages, they\u2019re more capable of handling higher rents.\u00a0\n\nAdvocates for affordable housing are sounding the alarm about what President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies might mean for low- and middle-income families. His pick to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development, former neurosurgeon and one-time presidential rival Ben Carson, has no experience in housing policy and has criticized the social safety net.\u00a0\n\nStill, the more stubborn problem may be addressing an economy that increasingly rewards the highest-earning Americans, while providing only small income gains to everyone else.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.75675678253174, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 693, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.86038776774, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 11, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.58730158730159, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.0}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-comey-state-of-fbi-private-message-to-staff/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2145, 2525, 3436]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 546, "scraper_regex": 579}}, "headline": "FBI Director Comey comments on election email criticisms in staff memo", "wordcount_as_scraped": 579, "date": "20170105220000", "story_content": "FBI Director James Comey said in a private memo to the FBI staff this week that the criticism over the controversial decisions made by the FBI in 2016, \u201cin the wake of a contentious election cycle,\u2019\u2019 apparently referring to the investigation into the Clinton emails, bothered him, but not much \u201cbecause of the way the decisions were made.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am uncomfortable spending time talking about me but I am grateful for the support so many of you have expressed in recent months,\u2019\u2019 Comey told the staff in his New Year\u2019s memo obtained by CBS News.\n\n\u201cI would be lying if I said the external criticism doesn\u2019t bother me at all but the truth is, it doesn\u2019t bother me much because of the way we made decisions,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAlthough Comey has not spoken publicly about the Clinton investigation since the election, it is not the first time he has visited the issue with the workforce, both at headquarters and the field offices.\n\nIn his annual state of the FBI message, Comey said it was another great year for the FBI, in all areas of operation including counter-intelligence, counterterrorism, criminal, and cyber.\n\nHe set a vision for the FBI over the next five years and wanted to keep focused on its mission of protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution of the United States.\n\nHe said they need to stay ahead of the threat through leadership, agility and integration.\n\nHe said the FBI will continue to be engaged in the complicated conversations in this country about the impact of encryption on law enforcement and national security work, arguing that \u201cgoing dark\u201d is falling across larger portions of law enforcement\u2019s work especially in the form of devices that can\u2019t be opened despite search warrants.\n\nComey looked back at other challenges that faced the FBI last year beginning with the federal Oregon wildlife refuge standoff in which a militia member was killed by a state trooper, and the Orlando nightclub attack, which was carried out by an individual previously known to the FBI and continuing through the controversial Clinton email investigation.\n\n\u00a0\u201cAt every turn last year, we were faced with choosing among bad options and making decisions we knew would bring a torrent of criticism,\u2019\u2019 Comey said without referring specifically to the Clinton email investigation. \u201cBut at each turn, we asked ourselves only: which option is most consistent with our values?

John Kelly told members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee during a confirmation hearing Tuesday. \u201cCertainly it has to be a layered approach.\u201d\n\nThe normally blunt-talking Marine walked a fine line in his answers to several questions about how Trump\u2019s Homeland Security Department will carry out its many varied missions, specifically efforts to find and deport immigrants living in the country illegally. He struck a balance between defending Trump\u2019s hard-line positions on immigration and border security, and the more moderate positions of some senators, especially Democrats.\n\nAsked about the fate of young immigrants protected from deportation by President Barack Obama, Kelly told Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California that \u201cthe law would guide him\u201d in every decision he will make if confirmed.\n\nKelly also said the agency doesn\u2019t appear to have a particularly efficient way to track visitors who have overstayed their visas and suggested it may be appropriate to \u201csend someone to their house ... and ask them why they haven\u2019t departed.\u201d\n\nAnswering questions about his plans to secure the border, stop the flow of drugs and curb illegal border crossings, Kelly told lawmakers border security shouldn\u2019t only focus on the frontier with Mexico, but said \u201csecurity of the border starts 1,500 miles south of the Rio Grande in the jungles of Latin America.\u201d He added that the U.S. should do more to curb demand for drugs in the United States and help stem the violence in a trio of Central American countries whose residents have been fleeing to the United States in recent years.\n\nKelly\u2019s confirmation is almost assured - a reality expressed by both Republican and Democratic senators Tuesday - but members of the committee nonetheless pressed him to specify his stances on immigration enforcement, border security and some of Trump\u2019s more controversial suggestions during the campaign, including the possibility of a registration system for Muslim immigrants.\n\nKelly told lawmakers he does not support registering people based on ethnicity or religion and said he didn\u2019t think religion should be a basis for counterterrorism or law enforcement operations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever appropriate to focus on something like religion as the only factor,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nHe also said he accepts with \u201chigh confidence\u201d reports from the intelligence community that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nKelly said he did not anticipate that immigration enforcement officials would focus on young immigrants living in the country illegally who have been temporarily protected from deportation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big spectrum of people who need to be dealt with,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThose categories would be prioritized. I would guess this category might not be the highest priority for removal.\u201d\n\nHe is one of several retired generals tapped for top positions by Trump. That has raised some concerns about undue military influence in his administration and weakening the American tradition of civilian control of government.\n\nBut Kelly is widely respected by Democrats and Republicans alike. As the former head of the military\u2019s Southern Command, based in South Florida, he routinely worked with the Department of Homeland Security to combat human trafficking and drug smuggling.\n\nIn a lengthy questionnaire sent to senators, Kelly said he is committed to telling \u201ctruth to power.\u201d The commitment addresses concerns that some lawmakers have about the president-elect\u2019s willingness to take in points of view that clash with his own.\n\n\u201cI never hesitated to disagree with any of them, or make difficult recommendations when appropriate,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, said his answer was \u201cmusic to my ears\u201d and promised that Kelly would hear from her often if she didn\u2019t think he was following through on the pledge.\n\nFollowing Kelly\u2019s hearing McCaskill and committee chairman Ron Johnson of Wisconsin suggested Kelly could be confirmed with ease.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident he will be a moderating influence on President-elect Trump and some of his more divisive rhetoric that he displayed during the campaign when it comes to immigration, and a Muslim ban and all the other things that were covered in the hearing today,\u201d McCaskill said.\n\nKelly joined the Marine Corps in 1970 and served three tours in Iraq. He was also the highest-ranking officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Marine 1st Lt. Robert Kelly, was killed in November 2010 in Afghanistan.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.1303257942199703, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 739, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.55272146384, "HarmVirtue": 14, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 8, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 44, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170111080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.95399188092016, "mft_mean": 4.0}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-new-york-city-mayor-is-top-contender-to-be-secretary-of-state/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [786]}}, "headline": "Former New York City mayor is top contender to be secretary of state", "wordcount_as_scraped": 951, "date": "20161115050000", "story_content": "One of Donald Trump\u2019s most ardent defenders during his presidential campaign, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is the top contender to be secretary of state in his administration, CBS News\u2019 Sopan Deb confirms, citing a Trump campaign source.\n\nEarlier Monday evening Giuliani had suggested at an election forum held by the Wall Street Journal forum he wasn\u2019t interested in another one of the Trump administration\u2019s top jobs.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I won\u2019t be attorney general,\u201d he told the crowd.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be meeting with the president-elect at Trump Tower, Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller told reporters. \u201cThey\u2019ll be reviewing a number of names,\u201d he said Monday night.\u00a0\n\nThe Associated Press reported that there was no real competition for the job and that it was Giuliani\u2019s if he wanted it, although another official told the AP that John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, remained in contention for the job.\n\nGiuliani, 72, would be an out-of-box choice to lead the State Department. A former mayor, federal prosecutor and top Trump adviser, he lacks extensive foreign policy experience. Known for his hard-line law-and-order views and brusque manner, he would set a very different tone than previous holders of the job, including Trump\u2019s ex-rival Hillary Clinton, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice.\n\nBolton has years of federal government experience, but he has also raised eyebrows with some of his hawkish stances, including a 2015 op-ed in The New York Times in which he advocated bombing Iran to halt the country\u2019s development of nuclear weapons.\n\nAsked about the secretary of state speculation, Mr. Trump said that Bolton \u201cwould be a very good choice.\u201d But asked if there was anyone better, he replied with a mischievous smile: \u201cMaybe me, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nPresident-elect Trump was also considering Monday whether to inject new diversity into the GOP by recommending a woman to lead the Republican Party and an openly gay man to represent the United States at the United Nations.\n\nThe moves, among dozens under consideration from his transition team, follow an intense and extended backlash from Trump\u2019s decision on Sunday to appoint Steve Bannon, a man celebrated by the white nationalist movement, to serve as his chief strategist and senior adviser.\n\n\u201cAfter winning the presidency but losing the popular vote, President-elect Trump must try to bring Americans together - not continue to fan the flames of division and bigotry,\u201d said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. She called Bannon\u2019s appointment \u201can alarming signal\u201d that Trump \u201cremains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign.\u201d\n\nWith his inauguration just 66 days away, though, Mr. Trump focused on building his team and speaking to foreign leaders. He remained sequestered in Trump Tower in New York.\n\nInexperienced on the international stage, the Republican president-elect spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone. His transition office said in a readout that \u201che is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.\u201d Trump has spoken in recent days with the leaders of China, Mexico, South Korea and Canada.\n\nAt the same time, Trump was considering tapping Richard Grenell as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He would be the first openly gay person to fill a Cabinet-level foreign policy post. Grenell, known in part for aggressive criticism of rivals on Twitter, previously served as U.S. spokesman at the U.N. under President George W. Bush.\n\nTrump was also weighing whether to select Michigan GOP chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, a niece of chief Trump critic and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney. She would be the second woman ever to lead the Republican National Committee - and the first in four decades.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be interested in whatever Mr. Trump wants,\u201d McDaniel told The Associated Press on Monday, adding that she was planning to seek the Michigan GOP chairmanship again.\n\nAppointing McDaniel to run the GOP\u2019s political arm could be an effort to help the party heal the anger after a campaign in which Trump demeaned women. The appointment of Grenell, who has openly supported same-sex marriage, could begin to ease concerns by the gay community about Vice President-elect Mike Pence\u2019s opposition to same-sex marriage during his time as Indiana governor.\n\nThe personnel moves under consideration were confirmed by people with direct knowledge of Trump\u2019s thinking who were not authorized to publicly disclose private discussions. They stressed that the decisions were not final.\n\nInternal deliberations about staffing come a day after Trump made overtures to warring Republican circles by appointing Bannon and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus as his White House chief of staff.\n\nThe former media executive led a website that appealed to the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d - a movement often associated with efforts on the far right to preserve \u201cwhite identity,\u201d oppose multiculturalism and defend \u201cWestern values.\u201d\n\nPriebus on Monday defended the media mogul, saying the two made an effective pair as they steered Trump past Democrat Hillary Clinton and toward the presidency. He sought to distance Bannon from the incendiary headlines on his website, saying they were written by unspecified others.\n\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve been able to manage a lot of the decision making in regard to the campaign,\u201d Priebus told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday.\u201d \u2018\u2019It\u2019s worked very, very well.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama avoided any direct criticism of Trump\u2019s personnel moves during an afternoon news conference, suggesting that the new president deserves \u201croom to staff up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to let him make his decisions,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.101419880986214, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 917, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.88044472189, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161115050000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.38058887677208, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/eight-in-10-americans-think-u-s-will-pay-for-u-s-mexican-border-wall/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3121, 3273, 4783, 5122, 5436, 6170, 6172, 6173, 6550, 7510, 7512, 7621, 7696, 8572]}}, "headline": "Eight in 10 Americans think U.S. will pay for the wall on southern border", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1406, "date": "20170119000000", "story_content": "By Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto\n\nDonald Trump campaigned on keeping jobs in the U.S. and six in ten Americans expect he will keep a significant number of U.S. jobs from moving overseas. Just under half think he will be able to get big money out of politics. About a third think he will build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border (something six in ten Americans oppose), or defeat ISIS.\n\nOverall, just 39 percent expect Mr. Trump will keep most of the promises he made during the presidential campaign, while over half the public thinks he will not keep those promises.\n\nExpectations are that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies will be most advantageous for large corporations, the rich and white Americans, and will be more detrimental to racial minorities and women.\n\nFifty-nine percent of Americans oppose building a wall along the Mexico border; 37 percent favor that. Views divide along party lines: 65 percent of Republicans favor building a wall, while 79 percent of Democrats oppose it.\n\nSeventy-nine percent of Americans expect that if a wall is built along the border, the U.S. will ultimately pay for it. Just 14 percent expect Mexico will pay, as Mr. Trump has claimed. Sixty percent of Republicans, and 91 percent of Democrats, think the U.S. will pay for the wall if it is built.\n\nMr. Trump intends to step down from the positions he holds at the Trump Organization and turn over operations to a trust controlled by his adult sons, but does not plan to give up ownership of the organization. Forty-six percent of Americans think these steps are adequate to prevent any conflicts of interest he may have during his presidency, while 50 percent think they are not adequate. There are large differences between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nMore generally, Americans are divided as to whether Donald Trump will serve the interests of his family and businesses, or those of the American people, when he becomes president. Partisan differences also run large on this question. Among Republicans, 81 percent say that Mr. Trump will make decisions to further the interests of the American people, compared to only 19 percent of Democrats who believe the same thing.\n\nMr. Trump has named his son-in-law Jared Kushner as senior adviser to the president. In general, 70 percent of Americans think it is not appropriate for presidents to appoint family members to senior White House positions, while just 26 percent think that is appropriate.\n\nMr. Trump has yet to release his income tax returns, something that candidates for president generally do. Most Americans (57 percent) think it is necessary that he do so, but on this question as well, the public is divided along party lines. Twenty-nine percent of Republicans say it\u2019s necessary for him to release his returns, while 80 percent of Democrats say it\u2019s necessary.\n\nAmericans are now split in their views of the Affordable Care Act: 48 percent approve of the law, while about as many, 47 percent, disapprove, including 32 percent who disapprove strongly.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the percentage that approves of the law is the highest it has been since the CBS News Poll began asking about it nearly seven years ago.\u00a0 \n\nSixty-one percent of Republicans strongly disapprove of the ACA; 44 percent of Democrats strongly approve.\n\nJust 22 percent of the public now think the health care law should be repealed entirely, the lowest that has been since the question was first asked in CBS News Polls in 2013. \n\nAmong the 22 percent of Americans who want to see the law repealed, 47 percent want the law to be repealed immediately, while half \u2013 50 percent- think it should be repealed only after Congress has agreed on a new health care law to replace it.\n\nSix in ten Americans are very concerned that if the law is repealed before a replacement is enacted, individuals currently covered by the law would not have health insurance. Another 24 percent are somewhat concerned about that.\n\nAfter a contentious election, 56 percent of Americans are optimistic about the next four years with Mr. Trump in the White House, but that\u2019s the lowest level of optimism for any president-elect in CBS News polling going back to Jimmy Carter in 1977, when CBS began asking the question. Thirty-nine percent are pessimistic \u2013 a record high.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind these numbers is a starker partisan divide compared to views of previous presidents-elect. Past presidents have received much more optimism across party lines. Republicans are especially optimistic about Mr. Trump in the White House (87 percent), while Democrats are pessimistic (62 percent), but eight years ago majorities across partisan lines were optimistic about President-elect Obama. \u00a0After George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 election, nearly half of Democrats \u2013 47 percent - were optimistic about George W. Bush taking office, compared to just 32 percent who say that about Trump today.\n\nAmericans\u2019 expectations about what kind of president Donald Trump will be are also more negative than expectations for his immediate predecessors. \u00a0Thirty-six percent of Americans think Donald Trump will be a poor president - far higher than either Barack Obama (4 percent) or George W. Bush (12 percent) just before each became president. Thirty-five percent think Mr. Trump will be a very good or good president, and another 23 percent say he will be average.\u00a0\n\nProspects for the kind of president Donald Trump will be also exhibit a partisan divide. Most Republicans expect Trump to be a very good or good president (71 percent), compared to just 9 percent of Democrats (67 percent think he will do a poor job). Looking back, Republicans about Barack Obama eight years ago.\n\nBringing change to Washington was central to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, and a majority of Americans (59 percent) think he will do that. Most also view him as a strong leader (55 percent), but there are areas of concern. More than six in ten Americans are uneasy about how Mr. Trump would handle an international crisis (64 percent) and most think he will divide the country (61 percent) rather than bring people together.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs Mike Pence prepares to become Vice President, more Americans view him favorably (29 percent) than unfavorably (21 percent), but like many incoming VPs before him, many are undecided or don\u2019t know enough about him to have an opinion.\n\nIncoming First Lady Melania Trump plans to spend part of Donald Trump\u2019s first year in office in New York while their son finishes school.\u00a0 Americans are split in their overall views of Mrs. Trump; more than half are undecided or don\u2019t know enough about her to have an opinion. Previous incoming First Ladies were viewed more positively. \n\nAfter Donald Trump is sworn in as president, the Republican Party will control both the White House and Congress, leaving the Democratic Party in the minority. Eight in 10 Americans want Democrats in Congress to try and work with Mr. Trump and Congressional Republicans to get things done. \n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans didn\u2019t always see eye-to-eye. Looking ahead, Americans think Republicans in Congress will have more influence than Donald Trump over what gets done in Washington.\n\nOverall, the public continues to give Congress overwhelmingly negative ratings, but 24 percent now approve of the job Congress is doing, up from 15 percent before the election and the highest it has been since September 2013.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThis poll was conducted by telephone January 13-17, 2017 among a random sample of 1,257 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. \n\nThe poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. \n\nInterviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. \n\nThe error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points.

Israeli officials warned the Obama administration that they\u2019d go to Mr. Trump after they failed to persuade the current administration to veto it. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut the issue is far from settled -- and the U.N. could still take up the resolution Friday. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe vote would have been one of the last opportunities for President Obama to take a stand against Israeli settlement building after years of failed peace efforts, but doing so could re-ignite a dispute with a close ally in the waning days of his tenure. The delay also dealt a setback to repeated Palestinian efforts to censure Israel over its settlements.\u00a0\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had publicly urged the U.S. to veto the resolution, calling it bad for peace. \u201cPeace will come not through U.N. resolutions, but only through direct negotiations between the parties,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump had also urged Obama to block the measure, issuing a statement nearly identical to Netanyahu\u2019s. \u201cAs the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\u201d he said in a statement on Facebook. \u201cThis puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\u00a0\n\nMr. Trump spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi to discuss laying the groundwork for peace in the Middle East, CBS News\u2019 Pamela Falk reports.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIsraeli officials would not publicly comment or say whether they specifically asked the president-elect to take the dramatic step of publicly opposing the sitting president or if they suggested that he call al-Sisi to attempt to get him to delay the vote.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CBS News, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who leaves office December 31, said he hoped the resolution would pass before year\u2019s end.\u00a0\n\nEarlier this fall, Mr. Obama granted Israel a $38 billion military aid package - the largest single military aid deal ever given by a U.S. President - yet weeks later, Netanyahu\u2019s government authorized a significant expansion of Israeli settlements and a related demolition of Palestinian homes. Using unusually strong language to refer to a U.S. ally, the Obama White House \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d it.\n\nThe Netanyahu government argues that the U.N. should not weigh in on the matter which should be decided in bilateral negotiations with the Palestinians -- yet it also hasn\u2019t agreed to halt expansion until then.\n\nHowever, after the vote was postponed, western sources told Reuters that the Obama administration intended to abstain from the vote, which still would have had to have abstentions or approval of the other veto -wielding members of the U.N. Security Council to pass.\n\nThe U.S., as a permanent member of the Security Council, has traditionally used its veto power to block resolutions condemning Israeli settlements, even though it sees them as an obstacle to a peace settlement. But in recent weeks, the Obama administration had been especially secretive about its deliberations, which included what one official described as an unannounced meeting between Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry earlier this month. The U.S. had been considering a highly unusual abstention, potentially rocking U.S.-Israeli relations, officials said, though they wouldn\u2019t say whether Obama had made a final decision. Egypt, the Arab representative to the Security Council, circulated the draft on Wednesday. Several diplomats and Western officials said the Egyptians postponed the vote due to pressure from the Israelis. Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, was meeting with Arab League diplomats to review the text. Diplomats said there was no time frame for when the vote may now occur and said it could be put off indefinitely. The diplomats and officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter, said Israeli diplomats had made the government\u2019s views clear \u201cin various channels.\u201d The office of the U.N. spokesman later announced Thursday that the Security Council meeting has been postponed. The draft resolution, circulated by Egypt, demands that Israel stop settlement activities in the Palestinian territories and declares that all existing settlements \u201chave no legal validity\u201d and are \u201ca flagrant violation\u201d of international law. Ahmed Abu-Zeid, spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, told the SkyNewsArabia channel that \u201ctalks are still ongoing,\u201d on the draft resolution. He said the talks are taking place in New York and in Cairo at the Arab League headquarters, and that an \u201cappropriate\u201d decision will be taken, without elaboration. He didn\u2019t respond to phone calls. There was no immediate comment from the Palestinians. Israel has expressed concern that Obama, who has had an icy relationship with Netanyahu, would take an audacious step in his last weeks in office to revive the peace process, but U.S. officials have said he has nearly ruled out any major last-ditch effort to pressure Israel. A Security Council resolution would be more than symbolic since it carries the weight of international law. In the past, Obama has refused to endorse anti-Israel resolutions in the council, saying the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be resolved through negotiations. Robbie Sabel, professor of international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said the resolution would have been \u201cpolitically damaging\u201d for Israel as it could have weakened its position when negotiating the settlement issue with the Palestinians. The U.S. and much of the international community consider Israel\u2019s settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegitimate and an obstacle to peace. Netanyahu rejects such claims, blaming the failure of peace efforts on the Palestinian refusal to recognize Israel\u2019s Jewish identity. Mr. Trump\u2019s selection for ambassador to Israel David Friedman has long ties to Israel\u2019s settler movement. The Palestinians, and most of the international community, say that the growth in settlements is endangering the goal of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Netanyahu and Obama have repeatedly clashed over Israel\u2019s settlement policies. Mr. Trump, who takes office in less than a month, has indicated a more sympathetic approach to Israel and appointed an ambassador who has been a supporter of the settler movement. Nearly 600,000 Jewish settlers now live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, areas the Palestinians want as part of their future state, along with the Gaza Strip. Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel annexed east Jerusalem, home to sensitive religious sites, in a move that is not internationally recognized, while the West Bank is divided between autonomous Palestinian zones and Israeli-controlled territory. Settlement construction has thrived under Obama\u2019s watch, despite his administration\u2019s constant condemnations, a sign of the limits of U.S. influence over its close ally. Obama has struggled to revive peace talks, which last collapsed in 2014. Frustrated by the lack of progress, Obama for more than a year had considered giving a major speech describing his vision for a future peace deal or, in a more aggressive step, supporting a U.N. resolution laying out parameters for such a deal. Although the goal would be to impart fresh urgency to the moribund peace process, either step would have been perceived as constraining Israel\u2019s negotiating hand while strengthening the Palestinians\u2019 argument on the world stage. A year-long wave of Israeli-Palestinian violence, which has tapered off in recent months but not halted completely, has further imperiled any peace efforts.

But the latest change in Uber\u2019s policy asks to track riders for five minutes after they\u2019ve already been dropped off.\n\nThat has some people questioning that these apps that have the ability to track our location really need to know, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner. \n\nMolly Twining\u2019s family depends on Uber, using the car service app at least five times a week.\n\n\u201cI use Uber a lot and my two children use Uber way more than they should,\u201d Twinning said.\n\n But the company\u2019s change -- adding the capability to track customers\u2019 whereabouts for a full five minutes after they\u2019ve gotten out of the car -- bothers her. \u201cIt would never be necessary for a company like Uber to know where you are when you\u2019re not in their care, their company or in their car,\u201d Twinning said. The updated tracking policy also lets Uber track riders even when the app is running in the background. Uber says the reason is it helps \u201cimprove pick-ups, drop-offs, customer service and enhance(s) safety.\u201d\n\nThe company explained to us it was facing challenges including connecting drivers and riders. But some consumers and privacy experts argue that goes beyond the scope of what\u2019s needed.\n\n\u201cThis location tracking in terms of not just during the ride, but also afterwards is totally unnecessary to this service,\u201d said Claire Gartland of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.\u00a0The group filed a complaint in 2015 with the Federal Trade Commission, charging Uber with \u201cunfair and deceptive trade practices.\u201d The FTC has taken no action on the complaint as of yet.\u201cA step like what Uber has taken here really represents an incremental erosion of the privacy that users have,\u201d Gartland said. \u201cAs companies continue to take baby steps and reach further and further into our personal lives, I think it\u2019s a very invasive practice and users are really upset.\u201d\n\nGartland said Uber\u2019s policy also would allow it to share data for marketing purposes, although an Uber spokesperson denies they are selling any of this location data.\u00a0\u00a0The car service\u2019s new policy has renewed the debate over how much access digital services -- including companies like\u00a0Googleand\u00a0Amazon\u00a0-- should have, and who should regulate them.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission limits how cell phone carriers can share consumer\u2019s personal information, but Gartland said digital platforms like smartphone apps don\u2019t face the same scrutiny.\u201cIn many ways it isn\u2019t going beyond what we already give to other companies,\u201d said NYU Professor Arun Sundararajan.\u00a0\n\nSundararajan said United States\u00a0privacy\u00a0laws are weak, but there might be another deterrent to bad behavior on the part of companies like Uber: consumer backlash.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow do we know that they stop after five minutes?\u201d Werner asked.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, we trust that they will do what they promise to do. I don\u2019t trust that Uber is telling the truth because I believe in Uber\u2019s good intentions,\u201d Sundararajan said. \u201cI trust that Uber is telling the truth because it would be really damaging to their long run profits if they were caught in a lie on something like this.\u201dUber told us there is a way to stop the company from tracking you this way: you can disable the location tracking in the permissions for the app and just type your address in manually.

Yiannopoulos writes for right-wing Breitbart News and is known for leading a harassment campaign that resulted in a lifetime ban from Twitter.\n\nHarborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg said the man who was shot arrived at the hospital at 9 p.m. and that he was in surgery and in critical condition. The Seattle Police Department released a statement early Saturday saying a person of interest in the shooting had turned himself in to University of Washington police.\n\nUniversity police said in its own statement that a suspect was taken into custody and that there were no outstanding suspects.\n\nNo other details were immediately released.\n\nIn Portland, Oregon, police used \u201cflash-bang\u201d grenades and tear gas Friday night to disperse a rowdy crowd. Authorities said some people in the crowd - that at one point numbered in the thousands - threw rocks, bottles, flares and \u201cunknown liquid\u201d at officers. The city\u2019s entertainment district was closed following the incident.\n\nBy about 9:25 p.m. the crowd dwindled to about few dozen around the city\u2019s Pioneer Courthouse Square, where earlier a small group of protesters burned American flags.\n\nAt first the flag burners, many of them masked and clad in black, had trouble because of the rain, but using lighter fluid they torched at least half a dozen flags. An ember briefly fell on the jacket of one participant but the fire was quickly put out.\n\nThe crowd in Portland then marched through downtown. Later, police announced the protest had become unlawful after some were seen armed with clubs and sticks and were throwing unknown liquid at officers.\n\nPolice said five people were arrested during the evening protests in Portland. Earlier in the day, police arrested another man who was wanted in connection with a November protest-turned-riot. When Billy Ellison, 18, was arrested he had a torch, knife and gas mask, police said.\n\nHe was booked into jail on two counts of interfering with public transportation.\n\nEarlier in Seattle, protesters from Capitol Hill and Central District neighborhoods streamed downtown for an afternoon immigrant and refugee rights rally. Carrying signs that said \u201cFight Racism & Sexism\u201d and \u201cResist Trump,\u201d people from the earlier rallies met at Westlake Park downtown Friday afternoon.\n\nPeople rallied and listened to speeches before resuming a march Friday evening, blocking traffic in some downtown areas.\n\nSeattle officers at the park had confiscated wooden poles, heavy pipes and hammers, Seattle police said on Twitter.\n\nAbout 200 protesters gathered on the Capitol steps in Olympia, carrying signs that included \u201cResist Trump\u201d and \u201cNot My President.\u201d Later Olympia police reported that about 100 people marched through downtown, causing some traffic disruptions.\n\nIn Portland, there was a student walkout at Portland State University a couple of hours before the flag-burning.\n\nLoren Ford and his wife, Judy Arter, stood watch with a sign that read \u201cImpeach Trump.\u201d\n\nThe couple traveled to Portland from the small town of Lebanon, Oregon, to protest because they felt Mr. Trump was not fit for office due to conflicts of interest and his rejection of intelligence community reports that Russia had been involved in influencing the election.\n\n\u201cI think he needs to be investigated right off the bat,\u201d Ford said.\n\nPatricia Elliott, of Portland, said she felt compelled to attend the march and could not bring herself to watch the inauguration earlier on TV.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d feel like I was saluting to fascism, for example, and I don\u2019t want to participate in that at all.\u201d she said.\n\nSome businesses in Portland\u2019s downtown announced they would close early because of the anticipated crowds. Owners of some establishments boarded up windows to prevent damage.\n\nPortland protests after Mr. Trump\u2019s election last November turned violent when a small group of demonstrators smashed windows, spray-painted buildings and started small fires. The demonstration caused about $1 million in damage, police have said.\n\nThe organizer of the Friday protest said he met with newly elected Mayor Ted Wheeler to discuss how to keep the rally peaceful.\n\nThe event\u2019s goal was aimed at Mr. Trump and at putting pressure on local elected officials to make Portland \u201ca sanctuary city, not just in the immigration sense of the word, but in every sense of the word,\u201d said Gregory McKelvey.\n\n\u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have had a meeting with the mayor if I couldn\u2019t put 10,000 people in the streets,\u201d he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.99520397186279, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 791, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.3655298922000005, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170121130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.9190897597977203, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/opioid-epidemic-newborn-babies-mothers-addicted-to-painkillers/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [229, 267, 676, 696, 2484]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 710, "scraper_regex": 759}}, "headline": "Doctors track \"an explosion\" of newborns addicted to opioids", "wordcount_as_scraped": 759, "date": "20161213150000", "story_content": "The opioid epidemic is increasingly touching the tiniest of lives, according to new research, and doctors who treat those affected say the impact is heartbreaking.\n\nMore\u00a0babies of mothers addicted to opioids\u00a0are being born dependent on the drugs themselves, driven by a sharp surge in rural areas of the country. The newborns come into the world suffering from what medical experts call neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a term for the constellation of health problems a baby experiences as it\u2019s withdrawing from exposure to narcotics inside its mother\u2019s womb.\n\nThe number of cases neonatal abstinence syndrome and\u00a0maternal opioid use\u00a0increased five-fold in the United States between 2000 and 2012, according to a research letter in JAMA Pediatrics written by scientists from five leading pediatric hospitals in the U.S.\n\nDr. Terrie Inder, chair of pediatric newborn medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, told CBS that the data highlights a major public health threat.\n\n\u201cThis has exploded. We are dealing with an explosion of a national health issue,\u201d said Inder, who was not involved in the research.\n\nFor the study, the scientists analyzed information from a national database that tracked births and deliveries between 2004 and 2013. Hospital codes enabled them to determine the number of babies born with NAS and the number of mothers on opioids.\n\nWhile the phenomenon is happening in rural and urban areas alike, rates are climbing at a much faster rate in rural and small-town America than in cities, they wrote. The incidence of babies with NAS increased from 1.2 to 7.5 per 1,000 hospital births among rural infants and from 1.4 to 4.8 per 1,000 hospital births in urban infants. \n\nFramed as percentages, about 21 percent of newborns with withdrawal symptoms in 2012-2013 were from rural counties, up from 13 percent in 2003-2004.\n\nTen years ago, the condition was predominantly found in disadvantaged communities, often in urban settings and linked to illicit drug use, said Inder. Now, it\u2019s touching women and newborns from all economic brackets and geographic areas.\n\n\u201cThe increase that you see in the JAMA data relates to a more widespread use of pain medications across all social classes. Now, we are equally likely to see a mother from a middle class or upper middle class background who was unaware that taking these medicines could lead to that type of consequence for her baby,\u201d Inder said.\u00a0\n\nNeonatal specialists are in \u201csurvival mode\u201d when it comes to caring for these babies, said Inder, who would like to see a national plan set in place with improved communication between neonatal specialists and obstetricians, \u201cto help us to deal with this escalation, this problem we didn\u2019t anticipate was coming.\u201d\n\nBabies with NAS and their mothers are separated after birth so that the newborns can be treated for withdrawal. On average, the babies stay 24 days in the hospital.\n\n\u201cThe babies, they are really unsettled, they really suffer, just like adults do when they withdraw from narcotics. The babies are very irritable and sometimes have high heart rates, sweating, flushing, diarrhea. They cry a lot. Often they need someone to really hold and cuddle and nurture them and support them,\u201d Inder said.\n\n\u201cThose crucial weeks of feeding, bonding and caring are interrupted. It\u2019s very impacting for both the mother and the baby,\u201d she added.\n\nThe mothers suffer, too, some unaware that the painkillers she\u2019s been taking could cause addiction in her baby.\n\n\u201cThese are mothers that have gotten opiate drugs prescribed by a prescriber. You can imagine the anxiety, guilt, and all those emotions that really affect attachment, the way a mother and a baby should be bonding,\u201d Inder said. \n\nThe study authors called for more funding to deal with the painkiller crisis in rural areas.\n\n\u201cThis geographic disparity highlights the urgent need for policymakers to appropriate funding for clinicians and programs that could improve access to opioid prevention and treatment services for rural women and children,\u201d they wrote.\n\nDr. Siobhan Dolan, medical advisor to the March of Dimes and an OB/GYN at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, said obstetricians \u2014 particularly those in rural areas \u2014 need to stop stigmatizing painkiller addiction and treat it as a medical condition, identifying moms and babies at risk.\n\nDolan said she\u2019s heard women talk about their personal experiences with NAS at conferences. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of blame and shame. We need to take it out of \u2018blame and shame\u2019 and just medicalize it. We can\u2019t stick our heads in the sand anymore,\u201d Dolan told CBS News.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.83631706237793, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 710, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.2777738867900004, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.52112676056338, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/severe-weather-dangerous-blizzard-threat-of-heavy-flooding-storm-hits-california/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [557, 1037, 1353, 1536, 2703]}}, "headline": "Dangerous blizzard, threat of heavy flooding as new storm slams California", "wordcount_as_scraped": 658, "date": "20170111030000", "story_content": "GUERNEVILLE, Calif. -- About 2,000 people in a rural California community near Sacramento were asked to leave their homes Tuesday as a river swollen by days of heavy rain threatened to flood, while north of San Francisco thousands more were urged to seek higher ground. Emergency crews and officials worked through Tuesday to try to bolster the levee in Sacramento County along the Cosumnes River, before deciding to ask 2,000 residents of Wilton to voluntarily evacuate before dark.\u00a0\n\nSacramento County emergency services official Mary Jo Flynn said water was expected to spill over the levee before midnight, flooding low-lying roads and buildings with up to 1 foot of water. An evacuation center will be opened Tuesday evening in neighboring Elk Grove but some residents said they plan to stay put. \u201cWe have no concerns,\u201d Lill Nichols, who with her husband runs a horse farm near the river, told the Sacramento Bee. \u201cWe have animals and can\u2019t evacuate anyway.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn the city of Sacramento, workers wrenched open more than a half-dozen century-old spill gates on the state\u2019s biggest river, the Sacramento, to ease pressure on the swollen river and on levees there. California is in a six-year drought, and the last time state workers needed to open the gates was December 2005.\u00a0\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings Tuesday for a number of Bay Area counties as steady rainfall continues to swamp the region, CBS San Francisco reported.\u00a0\n\nIn Marin County, rain gauges showed heavy downpours across the Corte Madera watershed while rapidly rising water levels surpassed the monitor stage and were approaching flood stage, according the the weather service.\n\nAmong the cities expected to experience flooding are San Anselmo, Larkspur, Corte Madera, Fairfax, Kentfield and Ross.\n\nSome 3,000 Sonoma County residents remained under an evacuation order as the Russian River rose again under pounding rain. Officials red-tagged seven homes, ordering residents out, when a rain-soaked embankment came crashing down. Johna Peterson was one of few residents who ventured out in the remote Sonoma County town of Monte Rio. Walking on the bridge across the Russian River, Peterson worried about what the coming hours and days would bring. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to go higher,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere for this water to go.\u201d In nearby Forestville, Kathy Granados huddled with two other people under an awning at the River Bend RV Park, watching the downpour. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting it out,\u201d she said. \u201cYesterday the water dropped, but it\u2019s going to get higher. We\u2019re just sitting here. We have no electricity, no heat.\u201d\u00a0\n\nTuesday\u2019s storm was the latest of back-to-back systems -- buffered by a brief respite Monday -- that have brought the heaviest rain in a decade to parts of Northern California and Nevada. The storms are part of an \u201catmospheric river\u201d weather phenomenon that draws precipitation from the Pacific Ocean as far west as Hawaii. Its impact can be catastrophic. A blizzard warning was in effect for parts of the Sierra Nevada, the first issued in the past nine years, said Scott McGuire, a forecaster for the National Weather Service based in Reno, Nevada. \u201cThis is definitely a dangerous, life-threatening situation going on up there,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should not attempt to travel at all.\u201d Forecasters warned of up to 10 feet of snow in the highest mountains, with up to 7 feet of snow around the resorts of Lake Tahoe, high risk of avalanches, and wind gusts to 60 mph. The Sierra ridge had gusts of more than 100 mph. Many ski resorts shut down Tuesday because of the storm. A number of main roads in the Sierra were closed, including Interstate 80, or required chains. Nearly 3 feet of new snow already was reported Tuesday morning at the top of the Mount Rose ski resort between Reno and Lake Tahoe.

He was true to himself and his voters and his promise to blow up Washington. For a man who understands the power of symbols and show, he didn\u2019t offer the expected ones, which was its own act of showmanship. He was not anesthetized by a day made to sooth the feelings of the losers in the election. He gave them little. And he called out the politicians sitting just a few feet away for selling out the people through their venality, even though they had just rested their hands from applauding him.\n\nThis kind of risk-taking and boldness are ingredients for greatness. President Trump\u2019s approach offers the possibility of undermining his opposition through a series of clarifying fights and building a new coalition.\u00a0 But if that\u2019s Trump\u2019s intent, his choice not to make an appeal beyond his base was illogical. It was out of sync with his revolutionary experiment and denied him a tool in addressing his concerns about being labeled illegitimate.\n\nThe weakness in president Trump\u2019s approach could be seen immediately. Day One his administration was focused on his legitimacy. Though President Trump has a busy agenda and moved immediately to\u00a0dismantle the Affordable Care Act, his press secretary held his first briefing room event not on any of his revolutionary moves, but to argue (against the facts) about the issue of his inaugural crowd size. The president also diverted to this topic at some length on his first day during his visit to the CIA.\n\nThe Trump team says the fight they picked over crowd size was about holding the press accountable. In truth, it was about diverting from the opposition marches taking place across the country Saturday. But the crowd size debate was also about legitimacy, which appears to be a fixation of the new president. President Trump refused to believe the\u00a0Russians tried to meddle in the campaign, for fear it would call his victory into question. He is visibly irritated about having lost the popular vote and regularly overstates the nature of his victory. Wednesday at the White House, for example, he was repeating the evidence-free claim that 3 to 5 million illegal votes caused him to lose the popular vote.\n\nThere are no challenges to his legitimacy. He is the president. Still, he guards this account vigilantly. The risk is that when you relentlessly assert your legitimacy it can backfire. If you have to keep asserting it, perhaps your legitimacy really is in question. The best you can do with relentless assertion is fight the world to a draw.\n\nThere is another way: act like a president for all the people. Instead of asserting legitimacy, build it and show it. President Trump could have done that on inauguration day.\n\nThis is a challenge larger than just one day. Donald Trump built something extraordinary to get to the White House. The question is whether he can build anything bigger as a president of the entire nation. That\u2019s what he\u2019ll need to sustain him when a surprise event puts him on the ropes as it does all presidents -- it\u2019s also what he\u2019ll need to get sixty votes to pass his legislation in the Senate.\n\nThe inaugural address was a special opportunity. He made a pitch that he was the people\u2019s president. He says he hears things that the elites miss. But there was nothing in his speech that suggests he has heard anything from those outside his base. When people don\u2019t think a president is listening they hear him say \u201cget in line\u201d and they resist. This is among the things that irritated President Obama\u2019s critics.\n\nThis is not about coddling snowflakes. This is about politics: adding people to your movement. For a politician making a third way, he needs converts. Why not take a chance then, during your big national moment, and show your detractors you hear them? In a year when not hearing and living in a bubble is a capital sin, it would seem like a president wouldn\u2019t leave any doubt in his inauguration whether he hears all Americans.\n\nHe had another option that he also didn\u2019t take. He could have nodded to those who worry that a norm-breaking president will break too many norms. Trump\u2019s adviser Steve Bannon said Trump\u2019s speech was Jacksonian, but Andrew Jackson\u2019s inaugural address shows the precise ways in which Trump took a different route.\n\nJackson showed humility about his new post, repeatedly referring to the limits he would follow as president: \u201cI shall keep steadily in view the limitations as well as the extent of the Executive power.\u201d He said he was \u201canimated by a proper respect,\u201d and praised the \u201csentiment of conciliation, and spirit of compromise.\u201d How conciliatory was he? The famous warrior in Indian combat even showed deference to Native Americans, promising \u201chumane and considerate attention to their rights and their wants which is consistent with the habits of our Government and the feelings of our people.\u201d\n\nThe rallying point President Trump chose was a new nationalism and patriotism. \u201cAt the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting theory of human behavior, but it\u2019s hard to argue that simple patriotism will bring unity in our present political moment. The people who felt such joyon Friday at Trump\u2019s inauguration attended the ceremony as a sign of their love for America, and the people who protested Donald Trump on Saturday all over the country did so because they love America, too. Patriotism isn\u2019t going to bring them together, and if you declare\u00a0your way\u00a0to be the patriotic way you\u2019re going to drive people apart.\n\nElections are a debate about America. They invite splits over the idea of patriotism and what it means. Inaugurations are designed to rebuild, but they require more than simple assertion-- we must all be patriots-- because if simple assertion were enough,the new president would have already convinced everyone with his campaign assertions. A president must seek unity through appeals to basic human qualities that connect all Americans.\n\nDonald Trump quoted from the bible to make his unity case. \u201cHow good and pleasant it is when God\u2019s people live together in unity.\u201d But why stop there? The Good Book actually has some clues for aspiring inauguration speechwriters about how to create that unity. Peter doesn\u2019t talk about allegiance to America, but puts it this way: \u201cFinally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble.\u201d\n\nBefore President Trump\u2019s address, many thought Nixon\u2019s first inaugural would be a good template for him. It contained the same dark notes Trump sounded during his campaign-- during a time in American history that was darker-- but Nixon sought to build unity from those same human qualities that Peter advised were the route to unity. \u201cWhen we listen to the better angels of our nature,\u201d said Nixon channeling Lincoln\u2019s first inaugural address, \u201cwe find that they celebrate the simple things, the basic things-- such as goodness, decency, love, kindness.\u201d\n\nHad President Trump tried either of those gambits it might have made arguing about crowd size easier. Faced with questions about crowd size, his advisers could have reiterated how the numbers didn\u2019t matter because he sought to be president for all the people. That would have been more than a simple assertion. They could have pointed to a speech that used any of the available and traditional tropes of national bond-building. Since the crowd size debate was also an effort to distract from the Saturdayopposition marches, this messaging would have been helpful in that context, too.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to drive a righteous wedge between the people and the politicians, it helps to have as many people on your side as possible when you are fighting in their name. Inauguration rhetoric obviously isn\u2019t going to convert your opponents, but acting like you are president for all the people gives you a tool to rebut those who say you aren\u2019t, keeps your political opponents guessing and maybe lays the groundwork for eventually expanding your base. If Donald Trump did not choose to do that in a venue where tradition and custom and his predecessors made it an easy trick to pull, when will he do it? Perhaps the bigger question is whether he wants to convert anyone at all.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.846859574317932, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1317, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.43688521524, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.80941533788914, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-infrastructure-plan-is-showing-signs-of-decay/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 813, "scraper_regex": 872}}, "headline": "Trump\u2019s $1 trillion infrastructure plan showing signs of decay", "wordcount_as_scraped": 872, "date": "20161220140000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON - Even as they maneuver for a share of the $1 trillion in spending Donald Trump promised to rebuild America\u2019s roads, bridges and airports, lobbyists for transportation and utility industries are beginning to wonder whether Trump really meant what he said.\n\nFrom the day he formally entered the presidential race to the moment he declared victory, Trump pledged to rebuild the nation\u2019s aging and inadequate infrastructure. He cited decaying bridges, potholed roads and airports like New York\u2019s LaGuardia that he said reminded him of the \u201cThird World.\u201d\n\nTrump or his campaign also mentioned schools, hospitals, pipelines, water treatment plants and the electrical grid as part of a job-creation strategy that would make the U.S. \u201csecond to none.\u201d It was a rare area in which House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats hoped for common ground with the president-elect.\n\nAnd the possibility of a major infrastructure spending plan is one of several factors that have fueled the recent run-up in stock prices.\n\nBut lately lobbyists have begun to fear that there won\u2019t be an infrastructure proposal at all, or at least not the grand plan they\u2019d been led to expect.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to tamp down expectations last week, telling reporters he wants to avoid \u201ca $1 trillion stimulus.\u201d And Reince Priebus, who will be Trump\u2019s chief of staff, said in a radio interview the new administration will focus in its first nine months with other issues like health care and rewriting tax laws. He sidestepped questions about the infrastructure plan.\n\nIn a post-election interview with The New York Times, Trump himself seemed to back away, saying infrastructure won\u2019t be a \u201ccore\u201d part of the first few years of his administration. But he said there will still be \u201ca very large-scale infrastructure bill.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that he didn\u2019t realize during the campaign that New Deal-style proposals to put people to work building infrastructure might conflict with his party\u2019s small-government philosophy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a very Republican thing -- I didn\u2019t even know that, frankly,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the election, Trump has backed away -- or at least suggested flexibility -- on a range of issues that energized his supporters during the campaign, including his promises to prosecute Hillary Clinton, pull out of the Paris climate change accord and reinstitute waterboarding for detainees.\n\nTrump transition officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe mixed signals on infrastructure have lobbyists and lawmakers puzzled.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re worried,\u201d said Brian Turmail, a spokesman for the Associated General Contractors of America, which represents more than 26,000 construction companies and 10,500 service providers and suppliers.\n\n\u201cAre we hearing signs that people just don\u2019t know what the plan is? Or signs that people don\u2019t want any kind of plan?\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the answer.\u201d\n\nLobbyists have responded by flooding the Trump transition team with briefing memos, lining up meetings and privately pitching their proposals to what they hope will be a more receptive Congress.\n\nTrade associations are urging their local members to seek out their senators and House members while they\u2019re home for the holidays. The contractors\u2019 association held a news conference in front of a bridge construction project in Little Rock, Arkansas. The American Road and Transportation Builders Association has given members form letters to send their lawmakers, while quietly floating a plan for new transportation fees to provide reliable sources of additional income for the federal Highway Trust Fund.\n\nLeaders of the U.S. Conference of Mayors emphasized their support for an infrastructure program in a recent meeting with Trump and urged him to protect the municipal bond tax exemption, one of the primary ways localities raise money for projects.\n\nThe Airports Council International-North America is lobbying to raise the limit on fees airports charge airline passengers. The money goes to renovate or expand terminals and increase the number of gates.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign pitch for infrastructure improvements included few details. A paper circulated after the election recommends using $167 billion in federal tax credits to generate $1 trillion in private-sector infrastructure investment over a decade. \n\nTo offset the cost of the credits, U.S. corporations would be encouraged to bring home profits they\u2019ve parked overseas to avoid U.S. taxes, in exchange for a lower tax rate. But private investors are typically interested only in projects that create revenue, such as tolls, so that they can recoup their investments.\n\nWhat states and communities need most is more direct spending, rather than tax credits, to help pay for upkeep and replacement of existing roads, bridges and transit systems, said Bud Wright, executive direction of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. \u201cThose aren\u2019t necessarily projects that lend themselves to generating revenue,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible tax credits would provide a windfall to investors in existing projects while failing to generate new ones.\n\n\u201cEverybody is putting together their Christmas lists for what they want to see in an infrastructure bill,\u201d said Kevin Gluba, executive director of the Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure. \u201cThe biggest question: Who is going to pay for it?

McGregor packed fans to the Madison Square Garden rafters and drove them into a frenzy as he packed a vicious punch against Eddie Alvarez.\n\nMcGregor used a brash and brilliant performance to knock out the overwhelmed Alvarez in the second round to win the UFC lightweight title Saturday in the main event of UFC 205 on a record night.\n\nHe dubbed himself this week the King of New York.\n\nNow, he\u2019s been crowned a two-class champ.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next for me,\u201d McGregor bellowed inside the cage.\n\nThe easy answer: Whatever the \u201cNotorious\u201d one wants.\n\nMcGregor dominated from the opening bell of the biggest card in UFC history - on pace to set an MMA pay-per-view record - and the sold-out crowd of 20,427 loaded with A-listers from Madonna to Hugh Jackman went wild with each punishing blow.\n\nMcGregor, also UFC\u2019s featherweight champ following a 13-second knockout of Jose Aldo, had predicted a fourth-round KO.\n\nUnlike UFC\u2019s laborious legal battle to reach New York, McGregor wouldn\u2019t make anyone wait.\n\nUFC has not decided if McGregor (21-3) will be allowed to defend both championships. UFC President Dana White said McGregor could be about the only fighter in the promotion to handle that kind of grueling fight load.\n\n\u201cWho knows,\u201d White said. \u201cI\u2019m going to let him enjoy his night.\u201d\n\nMcGregor crouched inside the cage waiting for the bell to ring and attack Alvarez (28-5). McGregor was the clear aggressor from the start, dropping Alvarez three times in the first round. Alvarez, out of Philadelphia, bounced up the first two times and took a severe beating on the third. McGregor forced Alvarez to fight with his back to the cage and never absorbed a serious strike.\n\nThe 28-year-old McGregor put his hands behind his back in the second, taunting and toying Alvarez to hit him. McGregor, UFC\u2019s biggest box office star, unloaded a left and ended the fight at 1:52 of the second. McGregor lay waste to a battered Alvarez and brazenly demanded in a speech peppered with profanities his second UFC championship belt.\n\n\u201cI was literally losing my head in there,\u201d he said.\n\nMcGregor snatched his new lightweight championship belt, paired it with his featherweight title, and UFC\u2019s first two-class champion in the promotion\u2019s history plopped himself on top of the cage and absorbed the scene of his historic night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time slaying everybody in the company,\u201d McGregor said.\n\nAlvarez is the latest victim on the list.\n\n\u201cEddie is a warrior but he shouldn\u2019t be in there with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m at a different level. Now, I celebrate as champion of two divisions.\u201d\n\nUFC was live and legal in New York for the first time since an MMA ban was lifted earlier this year.\n\nTo celebrate, UFC stacked the card with three title fights that set a promotion and MSG gate record with $17.7 million. The 1999 boxing match between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield drew a record $13.5 million.\n\n\u201cJesus is going to have to fight the devil to break that record,\u201d White said.\n\nTyron Woodley defeated Stephen Thompson via majority draw to retain his welterweight title in a fantastic fight and Joanna Jedrzejczyk successfully defended her UFC women\u2019s strawweight championship with a unanimous decision win over Karolina Kowalkiewicz.\n\nBut the New York stage belonged to McGregor.\n\nMcGregor, as he had been all week in New York, was the undisputed star of the card. McGregor\u2019s fans swathed themselves in Irish flag capes and his fellow countrymen sang \u201cOle Ole Ole\u201d in the concourse and stands throughout the show.\n\n\u201cIt was obvious the crowd was here to see Conor McGregor,\u201d Woodley said.\n\nThe New York crowd could not wait one more night to see him.\n\nThe two-decade ban imposed by New York left only unsanctioned MMA fights in the state. State lawmakers and Gov. Andrew Cuomo agreed in April to end the ban following years of failed efforts by supporters. The law authorizing the sport took effect in September and UFC optimistically already had MSG booked.\n\nUFC last ran a major show in the state at UFC 7: The Brawl in Buffalo on April 7, 1995. UFC, under Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta, exploded into a global phenomenon, become a staple on network television and ran PPV cards that hit 1 million buys during the ban. UFC 205 was expected to reach around 1.5 million PPV buys. UFC sold for approximately $4 billion to a group led by Hollywood entertainment conglomerate WME-IMG in July.\n\nMcGregor told reporters after the fight he wanted an equity stake in UFC.\n\n\u201cWhoever runs this place now has to come to me and give me my slice,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cBring me on board for real. I need to be set for life on this.\u201d\n\nTickets at face value and on StubHub only seemed to be selling for as much as UFC\u2019s selling price.\n\nThe fans saw UFC fighters deliver more kicks than the Radio City Rockettes in the 11-fight card.\n\nMcGregor might need an extra ticket for his next fight: The two-division champ is set to become a first-time father in May.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m just reaching my prime,\u201d he said.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.7502751350402797, "HarmVice": 12, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 833, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.34021328561, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161113140000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.3613445378151297, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-rejects-intelligence-report-donald-trump-us-election-hacking/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 775, "scraper_regex": 832}}, "headline": "Russians scoff at intel report on U.S. election hacking", "wordcount_as_scraped": 832, "date": "20170108130000", "story_content": "MOSCOW - A report by U.S. security services blaming Russia for meddling in the U.S. presidential race in an effort to support Donald Trump\u2019s election has brought stinging rejoinders from Russian politicians and news media, and a warning to \u201cfools\u201d from the president-elect himself.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin -- who was directly accused in the report of having personally ordered the election interference -- has largely stayed silent on the issue, attending Orthodox Christmas services in Moscow as usual over the weekend. Instead, his supporters in Moscow have taken to lashing out at the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusions, with many focusing on the report\u2019s lack of concrete evidence.\n\nAlexei Pushkov, a member of the upper house of parliament\u2019s defense and security committee, said on Twitter that \u201call the accusations against Russia are based on \u2018confidence\u2019 and suppositions.

An unclassified version of the report explicitly tied Russian President Vladimir Putin to election meddling and said that Moscow had a \u201cclear preference\u201d for Trump in his race against Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump has repeatedly sought to downplay the allegations, alarming some who see a pattern of skepticism directed at U.S. intelligence agencies and a willingness to embrace Putin.\n\nThere has been no official comment from Moscow on the report, which was released as Russia observed Orthodox Christmas.\n\nDuring the election, Trump praised the Russian strongman as a decisive leader, and argued that the two countries would benefit from a better working relationship - though attempts by the Obama administration at a \u201cRussian reset\u201d have proved unsuccessful.\n\nAt the same time, intelligence officials believe that Russia isn\u2019t done intruding in U.S. politics and policymaking.\n\nImmediately after the Nov. 8 election, Russia began a \u201cspear-phishing\u201d campaign to try to trick people into revealing their email passwords, targeting U.S. government employees and think tanks that specialize in national security, defense and foreign policy, the unclassified version of the report said.\n\nThe report said Russian government provided hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks. The website\u2019s founder, Julian Assange, has denied that it got the emails it released from the Russian government. The report noted that the emails could have been passed through middlemen.\n\nRussia also used state-funded propaganda and paid \u201ctrolls\u201d to make nasty comments on social media services, the report said. Moreover, intelligence officials believe that Moscow will apply lessons learned from its activities in the election to put its thumbprint on future elections in the United States and allied nations.\n\nThe public report was minus classified details that intelligence officials shared with President Barack Obama on Thursday.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press after the briefing, Trump said he \u201clearned a lot\u201d from his discussions with intelligence officials, but he declined to say whether he accepted their assertion that Russia had intruded in the election on his behalf.\n\nTrump released a one-page statement that did not address whether Russia sought to meddle.

Voters booted Sheriff Joe Arpaio in favor of Democrat Paul Penzone, a retired Phoenix police sergeant who criticized the 84-year-old lawman for focusing too much on promoting himself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Toughest Sheriff\u201d and too little on improving public safety. \n\nHis loss came as mounting legal problems in a years-old racial profiling case led to a criminal charge two weeks before Election Day. Arpaio was charged with contempt of court for ignoring a judge\u2019s order to stop traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. He could face jail time if convicted. Critics have slammed Arpaio for racking up $130 million in taxpayer-funded legal costs to defend him in lawsuits, including $48 million that has been spent so far on the profiling case. The sheriff earned high marks from voters early in his tenure by jailing prisoners in tents in the desert heat and dressing them in pink underwear. His popularity has waned over the past few elections, but a devoted base of supporters and impressive campaign fundraising have helped him pull out wins. The sheriff raised $12.3 million, most of it from people living in other states who supported his past immigration crackdowns. The movement lost steam after immigrant-smuggling traffic into Arizona declined and several state immigration laws were thrown out by the courts. \n\nOther major politicians who anchored the movement have either been ousted or decided not to run for public office again. But anti-immigration rhetoric from Donald Trump energized the state\u2019s conservative base and gave the Republican sheriff an ally. Arpaio introduced the GOP nominee at rallies and gave a speech at the national convention. Over the last four years, the courts have stripped Arpaio of his power to conduct immigration crackdowns. His officers were found to have profiled Latinos in traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. The sheriff, who acknowledged the contempt violations but insists they were unintentional, has pleaded not guilty to the charge. If convicted, he would face up to six months in jail. His plan of attack against Penzone, who lost to the sheriff in 2012, consisted mostly of TV ads that claimed Penzone assaulted his wife in a 2003 dispute. The Democrat denies the claim and sued Arpaio, alleging defamation.\u00a0\n\nPenzone has raised $1 million and gotten a boost from $2.9 million in campaign mailers and commercials from an anti-Arpaio group funded largely by liberal hedge-fund tycoon George Soros. Like Penzone, the Soros-funded group has attacked Arpaio for botching investigations into hundreds of sex-crime cases. Karen Cooney, a retiree in Phoenix who described herself as a conservative-leaning Democrat, said she voted for Penzone. She said she disliked signs that Arpaio posted on sheriff\u2019s vehicles asking people to report immigrants to the authorities. \u201cThe sheriff\u2019s race was a no-brainer because I have only been here a few short years and I just do not agree with Arpaio\u2019s means and methods,\u201d Cooney said. Crystal Burge, a homemaker from Phoenix, said she voted for Arpaio because of his tough jail policies, including his complex of jail tents. \u201cI really like his philosophy on the outdoor jails,\u201d Burge said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.19112586975098, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 540, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.12811827892, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 7, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161109070000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 5.7407407407407405, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/whats-to-be-done-about-fake-news/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [6425, 9461, 9463, 9465, 9467]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1338, "scraper_regex": 1624}}, "headline": "What\u2019s to be done about fake news?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1624, "date": "20161218150000", "story_content": "Are the news stories we Americans read, see, and hear FACT OR FICTION? A loaded and sharply-divisive question in these partisan high-tech times. No wonder the Oxford Dictionaries recently proclaimed  \u201cPost-Truth\u201d to be the Word of the Year.    Our Cover Story comes from Senior Correspondent Ted Koppel:\n\nAlex Jones: \u201cI\u2019ve been told this by high-up folks. They say, \u2018Listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.\u2019 I never said this because the media will go crazy with it, but I\u2019ve talked to people that are in protective details, they\u2019re scared of her. And they say, \u2018Listen, she\u2019s a frickin\u2019 demon and she stinks and so does Obama.\u2019 I go, \u2018Like what?\u2019 \u2018Sulfur. They smell like Hell.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing new, of course, about using media to commit political slander. In 1796, an anonymous editorial accused Thomas Jefferson of cowardice, of running away from British troops. The unidentified author? The current toast of Broadway: Alexander Hamilton.\n\nOur revered founding fathers could sling mud with the worst of them.\n\nIt\u2019s not the nastiness that\u2019s new; it\u2019s the delivery systems.\n\nA radio talk show host by the name of Alex Jones can be heard nationwide spreading the manure that fertilizes conspiracy theories all over the Internet:\n\nJones: \u201c\u2019Pizzagate\u2019 as it\u2019s called, is a rabbit hole that is horrifying to go down!\u201d\n\nThe charge that Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager, John Podesta, were running a child pornography ring out of the basement of a Washington pizza restaurant did not, as best we can tell, originate with Jones. The accuser remains anonymous. But that story had real consequences.\n\nFor weeks now, people have been accusing Lissa Muscatine and Bradley Graham of smuggling children through an underground tunnel from their bookstore, Politics and Prose, to the pizza restaurant.\n\nThey continue to receive threats, \u201cboth online and on the phone,\u201d said Graham. \n\n\u201cI really call it the weaponization of social media and the Internet,\u201d Muscatine told Koppel. \u201cWhat it\u2019s entitling people to do, or enabling people to do, is to take completely false information, make up whatever they want with no accountability.\u201d\n\nSo, what do you do? You call the police, or the FBI.\n\n\u201cIt turns out there\u2019s quite a high bar that\u2019s required for police and the FBI to take action, thanks to our First Amendment protections,\u201d Graham said. \n\n\u201cHas that made you rethink whether the First Amendment needs some modifications, given the age in which we live?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly has,\u201d Muscatine replied. \u201cMy father actually lost a job in defense of the First Amendment, back in the McCarthy era. So I am probably, more than most people, pretty sensitive to that issue. However, we live in a different world now. And it\u2019s a brave new world that we still have not figured out. The purveyors of this stuff have been able to run rampant with no accountability, and been able to do damage fairly freely.\u201d\n\nHold on, though: We love the First Amendment: Free speech, the right to criticize our leaders; protection, among other things, for our cartoonists, comedians and satirists. \n\nUntil recently, the targets of satire were obliged to grit their teeth, grin and bear it. But the shape of the battlefield has changed.\n\nThe president-elect reacted:\n\nJust tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016\n\nMany more people received Donald Trump\u2019s tweet, reacting to the Alec Baldwin impression, than those who saw the original skit on NBC.\n\n\u201cTed, you\u2019ve been doing this for a million years; the average American could never have gotten to you and said: \u2018Hey, Ted, you know, you missed this point!\u2019\u201d said Glenn Beck, who has one of the most popular radio shows in the nation. \n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s parity on social media. The downside is, there is no gatekeeper and there\u2019s not a real feeling of personal responsibility online.\u201d\n\nIn his time, Glenn Beck promoted some of the wildest, right-wing conspiracy theories out there.\n\nThis is the new, revised Glenn Beck. \u201cReally in the last year and since the election, I have been on as many sources as I can to beg the media to learn from my mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, sometimes you have a \u2018Road to Damascus\u2019 moment. I\u2019ve had my Road to Damascus moment. And if we don\u2019t change this, if we can\u2019t find our way to each other, it\u2019s only gonna get worse.\u201d\n\nWhich puts Beck on roughly the same page as Pope Francis. His Holiness compared media\u2019s obsession with scandal and ugly things to the sickness of coprophilia. If you\u2019re just finishing breakfast, look it up later; but it\u2019s nasty.\n\nIt can, however, also be profitable.\n\n\u201cThere is now an industry out there of people who are producing things that are untrue and that are highly shareable, which is the magic word,\u201d said Margaret Sullivan, media correspondent for the Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s all about engagement. If you can get things shared, you may actually be able to make money from it.\u201d\n\nEven if you make a fraction of a penny for every hit an article gets, it can add up. \n\nSullivan noted there is a group of teenagers in Macedonia who were doing nothing but coming up with fake news stories, with headlines like \u201cPope Francis XVI Forbids Catholics From Voting for Hillary!\u201d and \u201cOprah tells FOX News Host: \u2018All White People Have To Die,\u2019 Her Reasoning Is Unbelievable\u201d: \u201cThey set up their own sites and they registered to attract advertising through Facebook. And they put these stories out there that were completely wrong. I mean, made up to be wrong, but [which] sounded believable enough that people started sharing them. And they could make, you know, pretty good money for teens in Macedonia.\u201d\n\nJust this week, Facebook implemented a new policy that will make it more difficult for the purveyors of fake news to get paid. \n\nBut fake news is far from being the greatest threat. Koppel asked Sullivan, \u201cSo, one of your correspondents comes to the editorial board of the Washington Post and says, \u2018Here\u2019s this story which was leaked by the Russians to WikiLeaks, and WikiLeaks has just leaked it to us. And we\u2019ve checked on it, and it turns out to be true.\u2019 What do you do with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we actually faced that choice throughout, you know, the past few months,\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cExactly. So if it\u2019s true, you run it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if it\u2019s newsworthy,\u201d Sullivan said.\u00a0\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, \u201cWhat the Russians did in the context of the election was to go and take information that was stored privately, hack into it, and release it selectively over the course of many, many days, in an effort to try to politically damage -- or at least erode confidence in our political system, in a way that did politically damage one candidate for president.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf indeed the Russians have been engaged in trying to delegitimize one candidate, aid another candidate, undermine the electoral process, that comes dangerously close to a belligerent act, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Koppel asked.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s an unwelcome one; and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen such a robust response from the U.S. government,\u201d Earnest said.\n\n\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t seen a robust response.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve seen a robust response in terms of basically making clear publicly, and in private --\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of talk. Has there been any response? A \u2018robust\u2019 response?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, talk matters. What also matters is \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt only matters if you follow it up with action.\u201d\n\nAnd, before leaving on vacation, President Obama hinted broadly that action was either forthcoming or had already been taken. The president also urged us to look in the mirror:\n\n\u201cIf fake news that\u2019s being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it\u2019s not surprising that that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Obama calls out Russia in White House press conferenceFacebook fake news creator claims he put Trump in White HouseGoogle\u2019s top search result for \u201cfinal election numbers\u201d leads to fake news site\n\nKoppel asked Earnest, \u201cIs this an area where the First Amendment remains relevant?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s always relevant, right? It\u2019s the foundation of our democracy. But one of the things we accept as citizens of the United States, are reasonable and responsible limitations on our constitutional rights. For example, I think most famously, the Supreme Court has said, \u2018You can\u2019t yell fire in a crowded theater,\u2019 because that could pose a threat to the public.\u201d\n\nTo which Jonathan Turley, a First Amendment scholar at George Washington University, said, \u201cIf there was one statement of one justice in one case that I could eradicate from the face of the Earth, it would be Oliver Wendell Holmes\u2019 statement about crying \u2018fire\u2019 in a crowded theater.\n\n\u201cI think there is a lot of reason to be worried,\u201d Turley continued. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that mainstream media is collapsing on many fronts. The competition from the Internet is insurmountable. But more importantly, people now have the ability to create their own personal echo chambers, to go to news sources that reaffirm their feelings. The question is, how do we solve that problem? The one way we can not do that is to look to the government. That is the siren\u2019s call of censorship.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the alternative? Civility? Objective reporting?\n\nHow about a renewed respect for facts?\n\nIt\u2019s a thought.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For more info: ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.80186796188354, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1338, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.18560277821, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161218150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.16741405082212, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fort-lauderdale-shooting-suspect-esteban-santiago-ruiz-mental-issues-may-explain-little/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 576, "scraper_regex": 626}}, "headline": "Experts: Don't assume Fort Lauderdale suspect's mental issues explain shooting", "wordcount_as_scraped": 626, "date": "20170110170000", "story_content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Esteban Santiago, the 26-year-old man held in the fatal shootings last week at Fort Lauderdale\u2019s airport, reportedly has a history of mental difficulties and it\u2019s tempting to assume they explain the crime. Experts say: Don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThere is no one explanation that will fit this case or any case,\u201d says criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University, an expert on violence.\n\nWhile mental health troubles could turn out to play a role in the case, it\u2019s unusual for symptoms to drive violence, says Edward Mulvey, a psychologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who studies violence and mental illness.\n\nThere has been no public explanation of a motive for the crime, and terrorism has not been ruled out. It could be that mental illness played no role - it is unclear if Santiago had been formally diagnosed with any mental condition or was undergoing treatment.\n\nA few reported details suggest he was troubled. The mother of the Iraq war veteran said he had been deeply shaken by seeing a bomb explode next to two friends while serving in Iraq in 2010, and relatives said he seemed different when he returned from service.\n\nSantiago\u2019s brother Bryan said Esteban told him last August that he was hearing voices and felt he was being chased. In November, he walked into an FBI field office in Alaska and said the federal government was controlling his mind and forcing him to watch Islamic State videos, authorities said.\n\nAt that point, officials seized his handgun and had him formally evaluated. After four days he was released and his gun was returned.\n\nBut none of these details, by themselves or even together, are enough to draw conclusions, experts say.\n\nPlenty of people have had such experiences in their past and don\u2019t commit mass murder, Fox said. The fact that Santiago was released after the evaluation indicates authorities believed he was not dangerous to himself or others, Fox said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between being psychotic and being dangerous and psychotic,\u201d Fox said.\n\nWhile certain factors often show up in the history of mass murderers, like a history of failure, a tendency to blame others and social isolation, they also appear in the histories of people who don\u2019t harm anybody, Fox said. That\u2019s why mass killers can\u2019t be reliably identified in advance of the crime, he said.\n\nDr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University in New York, also warned against jumping to the conclusion that a psychiatric disorder is the reason for the shootings. Most behaviors have multiple causes, he said. And even if Santiago suffered from psychosis when he walked into the FBI office, symptoms wax and wane, Appelbaum said, so it\u2019s not clear what his situation was at the airport.\n\nIn any case, even if had had a psychotic disorder, \u201cmost people with psychotic disorders never hurt anybody at all.... There may still be other influences on him that affected his behavior in a material way,\u201d Appelbaum said.\n\nSantiago had other recent stresses. He recently became a father. He said in court Monday he hadn\u2019t worked since November, and he had no money.\n\nMulvey said there are people who are driven to violence by delusions, but \u201cthey\u2019re rare, they\u2019re much less common than people might expect.\u201d Often when psychotic people are involved in violence it\u2019s not because of their mental illness but rather something else, like substance abuse, he said.\n\nThe American Psychological Association says that while there\u2019s a small association between mental illness and violence directed at others, the overwhelming majority of people with serious mental illness don\u2019t pose a risk to others and should not be stereotyped as dangerous.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.42433738708496, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 576, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.4664865390800004, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.29861111111111, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rand-paul-blasts-giuliani-bolton-as-possible-trump-secretary-of-state-picks/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1119]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 726, "scraper_regex": 796}}, "headline": "Rand Paul blasts Giuliani, Bolton as possible Trump Secretary of State picks", "wordcount_as_scraped": 796, "date": "20161120180000", "story_content": "As President-elect Donald Trump assembles his cabinet, he\u2019ll have to have many of those top positions approved by the Senate -- and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said Mr. Trump might have a hard time getting people like former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani or former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton passed as secretary of state.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s a very close vote. I mean, there\u2019s 52 Republicans. Some of the people that have been put forward I think are not guaranteed to get any Democrat support,\u201d Paul told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cSo they lose my support and a couple of other Republicans \u2026 so I think that there are several potential Republican votes against someone like a Bolton. Possibly Giuliani.\u201d\n\nPaul said Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to the Iraq war is a big part of why he decided to support him -- and he wants to make sure that whoever is installed in the State Department\u2019s Foggy Bottom offices next year holds the same view on the issue. He has previously said he will vehemently oppose Bolton\u2019s confirmation should Trump tap him for the job.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI want people that run the State Department who agree with Donald Trump. And so I\u2019m trying to help. I\u2019m trying to be helpful here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the problem -- with both Bolton and Giuliani is they\u2019re unrepentant in their support for the Iraq war. They haven\u2019t learned any of the lessons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think regime change in the Middle East hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d Paul added. \u201cAnd so I think that it\u2019s important that we get someone in the head of the State Department that understands what Donald Trump said over and over again, the Iraq war was a mistake.\u201d\n\nAs for 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who met with Mr. Trump in New Jersey on Saturday and who Vice President-Elect Mike Pence confirmed Sunday is under \u201cactive and serious consideration\u201d for the State Department job, Paul praised him as \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201ceven-keel.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as reasonability, if I were to rank Romney up there with someone who I think is a reasonable, even-keel versus a Giuliani or a Bolton, I think Giuliani -- Giuliani and Bolton are out there on the extreme,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re very diplomatic. And I think you want the chief diplomat to be diplomatic.\u201d\n\nRomney, too, initially supported the Iraq war -- and Paul said he would have questions for Romney about his position on regime change, but said unlike Bolton and Giuliani, Romney is not \u201cunrepentant\u201d on the issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I would call him unrepentant. I would say that he is somebody who has supported the Iraq war and I would want to hear more,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we should ask -- no matter what the stature of the person, we should ask, \u201cWhat are your beliefs? Was the Iraq war a mistake? Are you for regime change?\u201d\n\nAsked whether there were any additional suggestions for secretary of State he\u2019d want to put forward, Paul said it\u2019s not up to him -- but that he\u2019s a fan of Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tennessee), whose name has also been mentioned for the post. \n\n\u201cI also find him to be very reasonable, very knowledgeable with foreign affairs,\u201d he said. \u201cAs head of the foreign relations committee I think he\u2019s interacted with many of our foreign leaders. And I think that\u2019s what you want as a reasonable, calming hand at State Department.\u201d\n\nOn the possible return to the use of waterboarding tactics, on which Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) sharply criticized Mr. Trump over the weekend, Paul said he agrees with McCain: that waterboarding is torture and the U.S. should stand strongly against it.

She bought air purifiers for her home. When a thick, gray haze turned the view outside her home into a scene from a bad science fiction film last month, she bought pollution masks.\n\n\u201cHaving a kid made the reality of the city\u2019s pollution hit me harder,\u201d she said.\n\nThe news that the Indian capital is one of the dirtiest cities in the world is three years old. But the awareness that it\u2019s toxic enough to leave its citizens chronically ill and requires long-term lifestyle changes is relatively nascent.\n\nThe first week of November, when a thick blanket of toxic haze covered the city, did much to hasten that awareness. And with the awareness came a brisk uptick in the sale of air purifiers and pollution masks.\n\nAs the noise and smoke from millions of firecrackers from the Hindu festival of Diwali died down, the city woke up Nov. 1 to soaring levels of PM2.5 \u2014\u00a0pollution particles so tiny they can get deeply embedded in the lungs. Levels in the Indian capital averaged well over 900 micrograms per cubic meter, more than 36 times the level the WHO considers acceptable and 15 times the Indian norm.\n\nManufacturers and importers of air purifiers and pollution masks say late 2016 is the first time they\u2019ve had a serious number of Indian families inquiring about and buying their products.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only in 2016 that we\u2019ve started to get through to the middle class,\u201d said Barun Aggarwal, who heads Breathe Easy, a company that assesses homes and offices in New Delhi for pollution and provides solutions such as air purifiers and indoor plants.\n\nWhen Aggarwal started his business in 2013, he had no customers for months. Later that year the World Health Organization report describing Delhi as the world\u2019s dirtiest city was released.\n\n\u201cIn the last four months (of 2013) we finally managed maybe 50 customers,\u201d he said, adding that those first customers were almost entirely foreigners living in the Indian capital who came from cities with much cleaner air.\n\nThis year he expects to hit close to 5,000 customers, with more local residents looking for solutions, Aggarwal said.\n\nOther businesses show similar numbers.\n\nSmartAir, a company that started selling low-cost air purifiers in China in 2013, set up shop in India in early 2015 and sold 1,000 pieces of its basic do-it-yourself model that year. This year it sold about 500 pieces in the first week of November alone.\n\nHundreds of people queued up outside the Vogmask store in a posh shopping area to spend as much as 2,000 rupees ($29) on high-end pollution masks manufactured by the California-based company.\n\nWhen the Indian capital topped the pollution charts in 2013, the city\u2019s first response was almost defiant. There was a belief that pollution sickened only the city\u2019s expatriate population.\n\n\u201cThere was a strong defiance. \u2018I\u2019m born and brought up in Delhi. This doesn\u2019t affect me,\u2019\u201d was how people saw the pollution problem, said Jay Kannaiyan, head of SmartAir in India.\n\n\u201cThis year, that\u2019s gone out the door. Middle-class, even lower-middle-class Indians are looking at air purifiers,\u201d he added.\n\nBut while awareness is growing, New Delhi\u2019s response to air pollution isn\u2019t very consistent.\n\nAir pollution is a year-round problem in the Indian capital, but it\u2019s only when the cold winter makes toxic air visible that people respond.\n\nOn days when the air so awful that one can see and taste it, the parks are empty and those who cannot afford pollution masks tie handkerchiefs or scarves across their faces.\n\nThe week after Diwali, when the city saw its most shocking pollution spike in years, the SmartAir office and shop in south Delhi was open all night, with long lines outside the store.\n\nBut on other days, when the sun shines and the haze lifts, most people forget about pollution. The masks vanish and the face coverings come off, even though pollution is often still way above government and WHO norms.\n\n\u201cWhen the media stops talking about it and people see sunshine they start thinking it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s really not. It\u2019s terrible,\u201d says Singh.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s a completely a panic-driven market,\u201d says Kannaiyan. \u201cPeople are only buying when it\u2019s so horrendous that they can\u2019t see their own hand in front of them.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.9692702293396, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 701, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.9708621262400001, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161206190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.2824536376604905, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-your-data-ever-really-private/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [135, 479, 778, 907, 2741, 3057, 3181, 3670, 3920, 3977, 4160, 4874, 4994, 5041, 5606, 5768, 6031]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 882, "scraper_regex": 958}}, "headline": "Is your personal data ever really private?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 958, "date": "20161216110000", "story_content": "Americans can\u2019t be blamed for questioning whether their digital data is ever entirely secure.\u00a0\n\nYahoo (YHOO) on Wednesday disclosed a three-year-old security breach that compromised 1 billion user accounts. The same day, popular note-taking app Evernote changed its privacy policy, disclosing that engineers that oversee machine-learning programs may look at customer data to improve the service, causing a firestorm among its customers.\u00a0\n\nBoth cases highlight the importance of understanding how companies approach personal data. Because online identities are always at risk, consumers should take steps to protect themselves, especially when it comes to sensitive data linked to financial accounts or email, cybersecurity experts say.\u00a0\n\nPersonal data isn\u2019t under threat only from hackers. It can also be imperiled by corporate privacy policies or user agreements.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPrivacy and marketing are often are at polar odds with each other,\u201d said Paul Calatayud, chief technology officer of Overland Park, Kansas-based FireMon. \u201cIt\u2019s important as a consumer in general to understand the services that you\u2019re taking advantage of and figure out what the monetization could be. For example, when Google came out with their version of Picasa, their initial licensing said any photo you uploaded became theirs.\u201d\n\nAny service that is free -- such as Yahoo\u2019s email -- often comes with marketing or data permissions that allow the company to analyze or sell customers\u2019 information, he noted. \u201cIf it looks too good to be true because it\u2019s free, they are most likely monetizing some of your data,\u201d Calatayud said.\n\nEvernote is currently coping with a backlash from customers after changing its privacy policy, with some customers taking to social media and vowing to close their accounts in response. The reason? Evernote said it\u2019s adding machine learning to create new features, and some of its employees may need to review customer data \u201cto make sure everything is working exactly as it should.\u201d\n\nEvernote\u2019s privacy policy isn\u2019t unusual, although the way the company disclosed the latest tweak \u201cmaybe made it more unique, and people are riled up about it,\u201d said Aaron Tantleff, information security and privacy lawyer at Foley & Lardner. \u201cIf you go through privacy policies, there is always the ability to access information for law environment\u201d or other purposes.\n\nTantleff added, \u201cPeople should understand that with a free service, you are still paying for it, and you are paying for it with your data.\u201d\n\n\nTime to uninstall Evernote. Like, right now. https://t.co/NQdPviUv5d\u2014 Wil Wheaton (@wilw) December 14, 2016\n\n\n\u201cTime to uninstall Evernote. Like, right now,\u201d wrote actor and blogger Wil Wheaton on Twitter.\u00a0\n\nEvernote, though, has had the right to read customers\u2019 notes before this recent policy change. Spokesman Greg Chiemingo noted that its existing privacy standards allow employees to access a customer\u2019s data for a number of issues, including \u201ctroubleshooting proposes\u201d or if its terms of service have been violated.\u00a0\n\nWith the latest changes to its privacy policy, any data reviewed by engineers won\u2019t be personally identifiable, he added.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe hope customers understand there is no broad set of employees accessing information,\u201d Chiemingo said. He added, \u201cThe negative reaction is based on an unfortunate misperception of what\u2019s going on. I have no access to customer data, and there\u2019s no reason the vast majority of Evernote employees would access anyone\u2019s notes.\u201d\n\nWhile privacy experts recommend that consumers read privacy policies and user license agreements, most people skip over the fine print and just click \u201caccept.\u201d\u00a0\n\nCalatayud said he tested this at a previous job when he sent out a new company policy to thousands of employees and buried an Easter egg in the fine print: If they emailed a certain account to say they had read the policy, they would receive $100.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe had 1 percent of people send that email,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\nConsumers need to decide whether they trust the company with which they are sharing their information, said Terry Ray, chief strategist at Redwood Shores, California-based Imperva.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOnce shared, regardless of the trust the consumer has in the organization with which they share it, the only measure of security for consumer data is what the organization has implemented as a data security strategy,\u201d Ray said. \u201cMy inherent trust of my bank, whether misguided or not, is still higher than that of a phone application, which I might personally see as less interested in protecting my private data.\u201d\n\nRelying on a password manager such as LastPass, which Calatayud said he uses, can help keep information secure. He said he groups his passwords into three categories. The lowest one is for social media sites such as Facebook (FB), where he says not much harm can come from a hacker breaking in.\u00a0\n\nThe middle tier is for brand-related or reputation management, such as professional services such as LinkedIn (LNKD).\u00a0\n\nThe top tier includes Calatayud\u2019s email and \u00a0financial sites, where a hacker could do real damage. He recommends multifactor authentication for the most sensitive sites.\n\n\u201cPeople need to think about how email is the new currency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical in information and enabling access to your other accounts.\u201d\n\nGood password hygiene is increasingly essential as more companies deal with data breaches. People tend to reuse the same passwords, or slightly tweak their passwords to create a not-so-different variation, which heightens the chance that a scammer will gain unauthorized access, Tantleff said.\u00a0\n\nHe said he believes companies that have been hacked should require their customers to reset their passwords, instead of merely recommending a password change. \u00a0\n\n\u201cI do recommend people should read their privacy policies. They should think about what it collects,\u201d Tantleff said. \u201cYou may want to think about going from a company\u2019s free service to its paid version, because of the difference of what they do with the data.\u201d\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.419727176427841, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 882, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.28903242037, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 13, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4739229024943301, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.1818181818200002}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/early-family-deaths-may-create-grief-gap-for-blacks/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4259]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 648, "scraper_regex": 717}}, "headline": "Early family deaths may create \"grief gap\" for blacks", "wordcount_as_scraped": 717, "date": "20170124190000", "story_content": "Black Americans tend to lose a parent, other close relatives and spouses at earlier ages than whites, creating a potentially devastating \u201cgrief gap,\u201d new research suggests.\n\nStudying more than 42,000 racially diverse Americans, the researchers found that death strikes black families significantly earlier than whites on average.\n\n\u201cBlacks were three times more likely to lose a mother, twice as likely to lose a father, and 2.5 times more likely to lose a child by age 30,\u201d said study lead author Debra Umberson. \u201cAnd they\u2019re 90 percent more likely to experience four or more family deaths by age 60.\u201d\n\nThe full effect is unclear, said Umberson, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin. Still, earlier research has shown that the death of a parent, child or spouse is the most stressful life event you can experience, which can lead to other stressors such as divorce or poverty, she and her colleagues noted.\n\n\u201cThis is a tragedy, one that reverberates throughout these family networks to affect many people in ways that surely take a toll on their lives,\u201d Umberson said.\n\nThe study doesn\u2019t explain why this gap exists. But, violence may play a role, and blacks also suffer from higher rates of diseases such as cancer and diabetes, she said.\n\nIn some communities, premature deaths are a common experience that should be addressed in schools and by pediatricians, Umberson added. \u201cThere should be interventions and strategies that address grief, bereavement and loss,\u201d she said.\n\nPaul Rosenblatt is a University of Minnesota professor emeritus who has studied racial differences in health. He praised the new study, recalling his own experiences interviewing blacks about family losses.\n\nIn one case, a woman who was young when her mother died acutely missed the wisdom, advice and help she might have received over the years. A young widower described the challenge of raising a teenager on his own. Someone else Rosenblatt interviewed had lost a sibling early and felt greater responsibility in caring for their parent, he said.\n\nHowever, Rosenblatt added that not all the aftereffects of a family death are negative. \u201cI would not wish loss and grief on anyone, but some people, as they grieve, get to places that could be called wiser, better grounded, clearer about the meaning of life,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that African-Americans have significant losses and more of them earlier in life, that may mean that relatively speaking more African-Americans get to these more wise places at an earlier age,\u201d Rosenblatt said.\n\nFor the study, Umberson and her colleagues analyzed two databases. One included whites and blacks in the United States who\u2019ve been interviewed at various times since 1992, when they were 50 years and older. The other database tracked younger whites and blacks born from 1981 to 1984 who have been surveyed 16 times since 1997.\n\nThe researchers looked for deaths of spouses, parents, siblings or children.\n\nBlacks were 20 percent more likely than whites to have lost a sibling by age 10, the researchers found.\n\nAmong the older group surveyed, blacks were twice as likely to have lost a mother and about 50 percent more likely than whites to have lost a father by age 20, the study revealed.\n\nAnd from ages 50 to 70, blacks were more than three times more likely than whites to have had a child die.\n\nIt\u2019s unusual for whites to outlive their children, \u201cbut it\u2019s not unusual for black parents to have lost a child,\u201d Umberson said.\n\nAnd compared to whites, blacks were nearly twice as likely to have lost a spouse by age 60. They were also 50 percent more likely to have had a sibling die by age 60.\n\nIf you consider higher rates of death among the extended family -- friends and neighbors of black Americans -- early bereavement is even more common, Umberson said.\n\nIn some cases, deaths of relatives or spouses may come as a relief or allow newfound freedom, Umberson noted. However, \u201cwhile there may be positive effects for some people, all of the evidence and science suggest they\u2019re greatly outweighed by the negative effects,\u201d she said.\n\nThe deaths \u201care almost certainly taking a significant toll on health,\u201d she added.\n\nThe study appears Jan. 23 in the\u00a0Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.47945213317871, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 648, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.24228263639, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0864197530864197, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/oakland-ghost-ship-warehouse-party-fire-officials-begin-identifying-victims/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [261, 806, 1117, 1828, 3502, 4460, 5320, 5803]}}, "headline": "Oakland \"Ghost Ship\" warehouse party fire: Officials begin identifying victims", "wordcount_as_scraped": 977, "date": "20161205030000", "story_content": "OAKLAND, Calif. -- The City of Oakland has begun releasing the names of victims of the deadly Oakland warehouse fire that claimed the lives of at least 33 people, including teenagers.\u00a0\n\nThe Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office Coroner\u2019s Bureau provided the names of seven victims who have been positively identified, according to a press release Sunday. One of the seven victims was a 17-year-old minor, so their name will not be released publicly. The victims\u2019 families have been notified.\n\nThe six identified victims are:\n\nThe death toll from the fire that tore through a warehouse hosting a late-night dance party climbed to 33 on Sunday as firefighters painstakingly combed through rubble for others believed to still be missing.\u00a0\n\nThe building that went up in flames, known as the \u201cGhost Ship,\u201d had been carved into artists\u2019 studios and was an illegal home for a rotating grou of a dozen or more people, according to former denizens who said it was a cluttered death trap with few exits, piles of wood and a mess of snaking electric cords.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf you were going there for a party, you wouldn\u2019t be aware of the maze that you have to go through to get out,\u201d said Danielle Boudreaux, a former friend of the couple who ran the warehouse. The death toll was expected to rise, as crews using buckets and shovels slowly made their way through the building, finding victims where they least expected them, Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Ray Kelly said. Less than half of the charred remains of the partly collapsed structure had been searched as of Sunday afternoon, Kelly said. \u201cWhen we started this investigation, if you had told us that you would have 33 victims, we wouldn\u2019t have believed you,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many people are left in there.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe victims include 17-year-olds and people from Europe and Asia, and they range in age from their teens to 30-plus years old, Kelly said.  Officials confirmed the identifies of the seven victims as of Sunday using fingerprints.Anxious family members who feared the worst gathered at the sheriff\u2019s office to await word on their loved ones. They were told they may have to provide DNA samples to help identify remains. As many as 100 people were there for a party Friday night when the fire broke out just before midnight. Fire officials were still investigating the cause of the blaze, but they said clutter fueled the flames, there were no sprinklers inside, and few exits to escape the building. Boudreaux identified the operators of the Satya Yuga collective as Derick Ion Almena and Micah Allison. She had a falling out with Almena when she convinced Allison\u2019s parents and sister about a year ago that the warehouse was a dangerous place for the couple\u2019s three children to live. Michael Allison of Portland, Oregon, the father of Almena\u2019s partner, Micah Allison, said the couple had a troubled relationship. Michael Allison and other family members were able to persuade his daughter, Micah, to go to a drug rehabilitation center in 2015, but Almena talked his way into the rehab center, and convinced Micah Allison to leave with him, Michael Allison said. The family\u2019s three children had lice and needed new clothes, prompting family to call child-protective services, said Michael Allison, who wept as he talked. But Almena and his partner eventually were able to win custody of the children back and cut off all communication with Michael Allison, the father said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhenever I could, I would to talk to (Micah Allison) to get away from him because I knew he was dangerous from day one,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of that has now been proven.\u201d Almena did not immediately respond to emails or phone numbers associated with him. Authorities declined to talk about the manager, saying they were focused on recovering the bodies and consoling families. No one answered a call to a number for Micah Allison. A man identified as Derick Ion posted a Facebook message early Saturday, saying, \u201cEverything I worked so hard for is gone. Blessed that my children and Micah were at a hotel safe and sound.\u201d He drew rebukes online from others who said he was warned the building was unsafe. The couple rented out five recreational vehicles and other nooks on the ground floor as living spaces. A rickety makeshift staircase led to a second floor where concerts were held. Former residents said there frequently was no electricity or running water.\u00a0\n\nOakland planning officials opened an investigation last month after repeated complaints from neighbors who said trash was piling up and people were illegally living in the building zoned as a warehouse. An inspector who went to the premises couldn\u2019t get inside, said Darin Ranelletti, of the Oakland Planning Department. The city had not confirmed people lived there, but a former resident, Shelley Mack, said she had been lured in part by reasonable rents in a region beset with a housing shortage and exorbitant leases driven by the tech boom. To a first-time visitor, the labyrinth of uniquely designed spaces was \u201cstunning,\u201d said Alastair Boone, a University of California, Berkeley student who arrived at the party with five friends around 11 p.m. Boone said she had just received a tour of the property and stepped outside when someone yelled, \u201cFire!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn a couple of minutes there were flames coming out of the windows and black smoke was just billowing out of the house,\u201d she said.

The Senate also passed and sent the president a $10 billion water bill with money for the California drought. The vote was 78-21.\n\nThe votes came hours after Democrats dropped threats to block the spending measure in hopes of using the shutdown deadline to try to win a one-year respite for 16,500 miners facing the loss of health care benefits at year\u2019s end. Instead, the legislation provides benefits at a cost of $45 million for four months.\n\nDemocrats evoked President-elect Donald Trump, a working class hero in coal country, in pressing for more benefits. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a potential member of the Trump Cabinet, led the fight of coal-state Democrats.\n\nBut House Republicans were unrelenting - and had already vacated the Capitol for a three-week holiday - forcing Democrats to concede. Manchin acknowledged Friday night that he did not have the votes to block the bill, but said \u201cthe fight will continue\u201d next year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m born into a family of coal miners. If I\u2019m not going to stand up for them, who is?\u201d he asked reporters.\n\nManchin was meeting with Mr. Trump on Monday.\n\nThe fight gave Democrats, who suffered devastating election losses a month ago at the hands of working-class voters, a chance to cast themselves and not the GOP as the champion of the common man. Manchin was joined by other coal-state Democrats who face re-election in 2018 in states Mr. Trump won last month, including Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just getting warmed up,\u201d said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., vowing a fight next year. \u201cThese miners and their families kept their promise, put their lives at risk. ... It\u2019s not too difficult for a senator or House member to keep a promise.\u201d\n\nThe dispute over health benefits and a separate fight over controversial legislation to shift more of California\u2019s scarce water resources to inland farmers were the final battles of a two-year session marked by constant quarreling. It was capped by a burst of productivity on legislation to authorize hundreds of water projects, repair Flint, Michigan\u2019s lead-tainted water system, and keep the government running through April.\n\nCongress will take a break before reconvening on Jan. 3 to get a swift start on repealing key elements of the Affordable Care Act and confirming Mr. Trump\u2019s Cabinet.\n\nThe underlying funding bill would keep the government running through April 28 to buy time for the incoming Trump administration and Congress to wrap up more than $1 trillion in unfinished agency budget work. It also provides war funding, disaster aid for Louisiana and other states, and an expedited process for considering Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for defense secretary, retired Gen. James Mattis.\n\nThe trucking lobby won permanent relief from recent Transportation Department rules mandating more rest and overnight breaks for long-haul drivers, though the White House and Main Street Republicans were denied in a bid to revive the Export-Import Bank\u2019s ability to approve export financing deals exceeding $10 million.\n\nThe miners\u2019 issue had history. Seventy years ago, President Harry S. Truman guaranteed a lifetime of health and pension benefits for retired miners to avert a strike.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the four-month extension was better than nothing. McConnell himself represents thousands of miners in the struggling coal industry and said he tried to get a longer solution in talks with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\n\u201cWould I have preferred that provision to be more generous? Of course I would have,\u201d the Republican said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nThe House had left town on Thursday, creating a dynamic in which the Senate had little choice but to adopt the stopgap measure. Both the funding measure and a water projects bill passed there by sweeping bipartisan votes.\n\nDemocratic opponents of the popular water projects bill, led by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., assailed provisions to divert more water to corporate farmers. The bill also authorizes long-delayed funding of $170 million to help Flint, Michigan, to fix its lead-tainted water system.\n\nDemocrats griped that GOP negotiators on the water bill dumped a permanent \u201cBuy America\u201d provision requiring U.S.-produced steel be used in water projects. But that effort lost steam Friday.\n\nThe spending bill also would provide $7 million to reimburse the New York Police Department for the cost of security around Trump Tower in Manhattan, far less than the $35 million the city requested.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.19244813919067, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 729, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.5512772699300004, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161210140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.84087791495199, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-backs-russia-turkey-syria-efforts-cease-fire-wavers/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [255, 296, 919, 2382, 5201]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 867, "scraper_regex": 919}}, "headline": "U.N. backs Russian-Turkish efforts to end Syria's war", "wordcount_as_scraped": 919, "date": "20161231220000", "story_content": "BEIRUT -- The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Saturday supporting efforts by Russia and Turkey to end the nearly six-year conflict in Syria and jump-start peace negotiations, as a\u00a0fragile country-wide cease-fire wavered.\u00a0\n\nThe resolution also calls for the \u201crapid, safe and unhindered\u201d delivery of humanitarian aid throughout Syria. And it anticipates a meeting of the Syrian government and opposition representative in Kazakhstan\u2019s capital Astana in late January. The resolution\u2019s final text dropped an endorsement of the Syria cease-fire agreement reached Thursday, simply taking note of it but welcoming and supporting Russian-Turkish efforts to end the violence. Western members of the council sought the last-minute changes to the draft resolution to clarify the U.N.\u2019s role and the meaning of the agreement brokered by Moscow and Ankara.\u00a0\n\nThere are dozens of Syrian opposition or rebel groups, and some told CBS News that they did not agree to the cease-fire, CBS News\u2019 Holly Williams reported.\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador Michele Sison said the Obama administration strongly supports a cease-fire and \u201cunfettered humanitarian access,\u201d but she expressed regret that additional documentation to the agreement with details about its implementation have not yet been made public. Meanwhile on the ground in Syria, rebels warned on Saturday that cease-fire violations by pro-government forces threatened to undermine the two-day-old agreement intended to pave the way for talks between the government and the opposition in the new year.Airstrikes pounded opposition-held villages and towns in the strategically-important Barada Valley outside Damascus, activists said, prompting rebels to threaten to withdraw their compliance with the nationwide truce. Rebels also accused the government of signing a different version of the agreement to the one they signed in the Turkish capital of Ankara, further complicating the latest diplomatic efforts to bring an end to six years of war. Nearly 50,000 people died in the conflict in 2016, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which maintains networks of contacts on all sides of the war. More than 13,000 of them were civilians, according to the Observatory. Various estimates have put the war\u2019s overall toll at around 400,000 dead.\u00a0\n\nIf the truce holds, the government and the opposition will be expected to meet for talks for the first time in nearly a year in the Kazakh capital of Astana in the second half of January. Those talks will be mediated by Russia, Turkey and Iran, though Russia\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin has said other key players including the United States are welcome to participate. Churkin said after Saturday\u2019s vote that the Astana talks will be the first face-to-face negotiations between the Syrian government and opposition and he expressed hope that 2017 will see a political settlement of the conflict that has claimed over 250,000 lives. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem and Major General Ali Mamlouk, head of the National Security Bureau, were in Tehran Saturday to discuss developments with their Iranian counterparts, according to Iranian state media. They met with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Ali Shamkhani, Secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council. The Kremlin meanwhile said Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani confirmed their commitment to negotiations in Astana, in a phone conversation between the two leaders. Iran and Russia have provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Syrian President Bashar Assad throughout the conflict, while Turkey has served as a rear base and source of supplies for the opposition. The developments follow months of talks between Ankara and Moscow that culminated in a cease-fire agreement that went into effect Friday at midnight. But in a statement issued by a coalition of 11 rebel factions, including the powerful Army of Islam group operating in the Damascus countryside, rebels said they could not abide by the cease-fire if the government continued its assault on Barada Valley. The statement also complained that the government\u2019s version of the agreement signed in Ankara last week had deleted \u201ca number of essential and non-negotiable points.\u201d It said the opposition had agreed to a cease-fire encompassing the whole of Syria, without any exceptions to region or faction. The Barada Valley Media Center said Lebanese Hezbollah militants were firing on villages and towns in the water-rich region as Russian and government aircraft carried out raids for the 10th consecutive day Saturday. The Lebanese militant group is a key ally to President Assad\u2019s forces. The Barada Valley is the primary source of water for the capital and its surrounding region. The government assault has coincided with a severe water shortage in Damascus since Dec. 22. Images from the valley\u2019s Media Center indicate its Ain al-Fijeh spring and water processing facility have been destroyed in airstrikes. The government says rebels spoiled the water source with diesel fuel, forcing it to cut supplies to the capital.\u00a0\n\nThe Observatory reported at least two civilians and five militants have been killed in battles over opposition-held Eastern Ghouta and Barada Valley regions around Damascus, since the truce came into effect Thursday at midnight. The Syrian military on Friday denied attacking the valley, saying it respected the Russian and Turkish brokered truce. Meanwhile, Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu news agency reported the death of an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, commander in a Turkish airstrike near the north Syrian town of al-Bab on Friday. The truce does not cover operations against ISIS or al Qaeda\u2019s Syria affiliate, the Fatah al-Sham front. Anadolu identified the commander as Abu Ansari.

But there were also raises among clerical workers for Opportunity Village in Las Vegas, a nonprofit that teaches vocational skills to people with disabilities and raises its money through private donations and running a thrift store.\n\nOpportunity president Bob Brown said he couldn\u2019t bear to backtrack on the decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s put us in a difficult situation - you\u2019re spending money you wouldn\u2019t have been spending,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Colorado, some restaurant owners operating on thin margins shifted salaried managers to hourly pay so they could better track their hours and cap them at 40.\n\n\u201cThat was demoralizing for managers who felt they were being demoted,\u201d said Sonia Riggs, CEO of the Colorado Restaurant Association.\n\nThe Department of Labor last May ordered the changes to give overtime to many more American workers, saying they would \u201cgo a long way toward realizing President Obama\u2019s commitment to ensuring every worker is compensated fairly for their hard work.\u201d\n\nInflation had weakened the U.S. overtime law passed decades ago. Overtime provisions applied to 62 percent of U.S. full-time salaried workers in 1975 but just 7 percent today.\n\nThat means some low-level retail and restaurant managers are making $25,000 a year but aren\u2019t eligible for overtime, even when they\u2019re working 60 hours a week.\n\nThe court agreed with the rule\u2019s opponents that the labor department overstepped the authority it has from Congress and that the rule could cause irreparable harm if it took effect Dec. 1 as scheduled. The department is now considering its legal options, but Trump will be in charge of the department after taking office on Jan. 20.\n\nTrump told the news website Circa in August that he hoped small businesses would get an exception from the overtime rule, although the issue was not a prominent presidential campaign theme.\n\nThe rule\u2019s supporters are now grappling with implications for workers who were expecting more overtime pay just as the holiday shopping rush gets underway.\n\n\u201cThis is about the worst news they could get heading into Thanksgiving and the holiday season,\u201d said Vicki Shabo, vice president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, a Washington, D.C.-based group that promotes workplace fairness.\n\nWorkers who want to make a good impression on their employers, feel compelled to cover for absent co-workers or are passionate about their jobs often put in far more than 40 hours a week and end up making a sub-minimum wage.

But the growth spurt isn\u2019t expected to last.\n\nThe gain in the gross domestic product, the economy\u2019s total output of goods and services, came from added strength in consumer spending, business investment and the government sector, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The government had previously estimated last quarter\u2019s annual growth rate at 3.2 percent.\n\nMichael Gapen of Barclays said that the new report \u201cpaints a picture of a healthy consumer, likely fueled by ongoing gains in employment, modest increases in wages, and solid balance sheets.\u201d\n\nThe economy\u2019s acceleration last quarter marked a sharp pickup from the tepid annual growth of 0.8 percent in the first quarter and 1.4 percent in the second. Still, growth is expected to slow to a roughly 1.5 percent annual rate in the October-December quarter, reflecting in part less consumer spending and less business stockpiling.\n\nGrowth for the entire year, economists say, is likely to be around 1.5 percent. That would be down from 2.6 percent in 2015 and would be the weakest performance since the economy shrank 2.8 percent in 2009 at the depths of the worst economic downturn since the 1930s. The recovery began in mid-2009, but growth has averaged just over 2 percent, the weakest expansion in the post-World War II period.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump had criticized the sluggish pace of growth during the campaign and said his economic policies would accelerate annual GDP growth to 4 percent or better. To do that, Trump said he would eliminate many government regulations, boost spending on the nation\u2019s aging infrastructure and slash taxes.\n\nMost economists don\u2019t think 4 percent growth is realistic, given a chronic slowdown in worker productivity and a slower-growing U.S. workforce due in part to retiring baby boomers.\n\nMost forecasters expect growth of around 2.5 percent next year, though they say those estimates could rise if Trump wins congressional support for much of his economic program. Stock markets have risen sharply since Trump\u2019s election, partly a reflection of optimism that his proposals would boost growth and corporate profits.\n\nThursday\u2019s report was the government\u2019s third and final estimate of GDP growth for the July-September quarter. The upward revision mainly reflected stronger consumer spending, which grew at a 3 percent annual rate, more than the 2.8 percent pace that was estimated a month ago. Consumer spending is closely watched because it accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity.\n\nThe government also revised up its estimate for business investment: It showed an increase at a 1.4 percent annual rate, up from a much smaller 0.1 percent rate in the previous estimate.\n\nGovernment spending was also revised up to show growth at a 0.8 percent annual rate, an increase that reflected a smaller drag from cutbacks at the state and local level.\n\nThe Federal Reserve last week boosted a key interest rate by a quarter-point, just the second increase in the past decade. Fed officials say they think they can begin to gradually interest rates as they near their goals for full employment, and inflation increases by about 2 percent a year.\n\nIn public comments last week, Chair Janet Yellen made no predictions about Trump\u2019s economic program. But Fed officials forecast that they would raise rates three times in 2017, up from their previous forecast of two hikes", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.33003300428390503, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 555, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.655554777357, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 5, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161222170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.9009009009009008, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.45454545454499995}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-military-investigation-civilian-deaths-afghanistan-battle-taliban-kunduz/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "U.S. military admits 33 civilians killed in fierce clash with Taliban", "wordcount_as_scraped": 632, "date": "20170112110000", "story_content": "KABUL, Afghanistan -- The U.S. military in Afghanistan said on Thursday that its investigation into a November firefight with the Taliban in northern Kunduz province has shown that 33 civilians died in the raid during which U.S. troops fired on Afghan homes.\n\nThe probe followed claims that civilian deaths resulted from airstrikes called in to support Afghan and U.S. troops who came under fire in the province\u2019s village of Buz-e Kandahari, which targeted two senior Taliban commanders.\n\nThe two Taliban figures, responsible for violence in Kunduz the previous month, were killed in the operation.\n\nAccording to a U.S. military statement, the investigation \u201cdetermined, regretfully, that 33 civilians were killed and 27 wounded\u201d as troops responded to fire from \u201cTaliban who were using civilian houses as firing positions.\u201d\n\nAfter the raid, Kunduz residents carried over a dozen corpses of the dead, including children and family members of the Taliban fighters, toward a local governor\u2019s office in a show of rage.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the circumstances, I deeply regret the loss of innocent lives,\u201d the statement quoted Gen.

The Taliban captured and held parts of Kunduz a year earlier as well, before the city was fully liberated weeks later with the help of U.S. airstrikes.\n\nIn the 2015 operation, a U.S. Air Force special operations AC-130 gunship attacked a Kunduz hospital run by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders, killing 42 people. Sixteen U.S. military personnel, including a two-star general, later were disciplined for what American officials described as mistakes that led to the strike. Doctors Without Borders has called the attack a war crime and demanded an independent investigation.\n\nAfter the firefight last November, Ghani criticized the Taliban for using women and children as \u201ca shield\u201d during the raid in Buz-e Kandahari. He also announced a local investigation had been started.\n\nThe U.S. military statement further added that its investigation \u201cconcluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense\u201d in the joint Afghan-American raid in the village.\n\n\u201cAs an indication of the ferocity of the fire faced by friendly forces from the Taliban-occupied houses, two U.S. soldiers and three Afghan Army Commandos were killed,\u201d it said. \u201cIn addition, four U.S. soldiers and 11 commandos were wounded.\u201d\n\nThe raid also killed 26 Taliban fighters and wounded around 26 other insurgents, the U.S. military said.\n\nThe investigation concluded that U.S. air assets used the minimum amount of force required and that the civilians who were wounded or killed were likely inside the buildings from which the Taliban were firing. In addition, the U.S. military said a Taliban ammunition cache was struck and exploded, which also destroyed multiple civilian buildings and may also have killed civilians.\n\n\u201cIt has been determined that no further action will be taken because U.S. forces acted in self-defense and followed all applicable law and policy,\u201d the statement concluded.\n\nNATO\u2019s combat operations ended in Afghanistan at the end of 2014, a move that put Afghan forces in charge of the country\u2019s security. Since then, Afghan forces have suffered heavy casualties battling the Taliban, who have tried to expand their footprint across much of the country. NATO and U.S. casualties have been few.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.654761791229251, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 605, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 20, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.6772709076300005, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170112110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.793388429752071, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/after-violence-abroad-trump-meeting-with-security-adviser/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [74]}}, "headline": "After violence abroad, Trump meeting with security adviser", "wordcount_as_scraped": 778, "date": "20161221150000", "story_content": "PALM BEACH, Fla.\u00a0-- President-elect Donald Trump is planning to meet with his incoming national security adviser in the aftermath of a rattling day of violence around the world.\n\nTrump appeared to jump ahead of investigators in blaming Islamic terrorists for deadly incidents Monday in Turkey and Germany and vowing anew to eradicate their regional and global networks. He called the brazen shooting of Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey \u201ca violation of all rules of civilized order.\u201d He added that a \u201cradical Islamic terrorist\u201d had assassinated the diplomat, Andrei Karlov.\n\nTurkish authorities identified the gunman as Mevlut Mert Altintas, a member of Ankara\u2019s riot police squad, and said he was later killed in a shootout with police. Altintas shouted in Turkish about the Syrian city of Aleppo and also yelled \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d Arabic for \u201cGod is great.\u201d\n\nAs for Berlin, where at least 12 people were killed and nearly 50 hurt when a truck plowed through a Christmas market, Trump said the Islamic State group \u201cand other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad.\u201d A man held by German authorities after the violence was later released after a lack of evidence to connect him to the incident.\n\nTrump\u2019s meeting scheduled Wednesday with retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn will come a day after Flynn and several other members of the incoming national security team met with Vice President-elect Mike Pence in Washington. Aides said the meeting was planned before the acts of violence, though they were discussed.\n\nThe gathering with Pence included retired Gen. John Kelly, Trump\u2019s nominee for head of the Department of Homeland Security; retired Gen. James Mattis, the pick for defense secretary; and Rex Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil and the intended nominee for secretary of state.\n\nWhile Trump has assembled his Cabinet at a quick pace, the process to fill out top White House jobs has been slowed by infighting among advisers. Some of Trump\u2019s earliest advisers have expressed concern to the president-elect himself that they are getting boxed out in favor of those more closely aligned with incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus, who has chaired the Republican National Committee.\n\nAmong those whose future is still in flux is Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s controversial first campaign manager who was fired after clashing with the president-elect\u2019s family. On Monday, Lewandowski met with Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s influential son-in-law, and could still be offered a job in the administration, though potentially one that would keep him out of the West Wing - and away from the president.\n\nThe president-elect\u2019s transition team has said it expects to announce some White House positions in the coming days.\n\nTrump met Tuesday with candidates for his unfilled Cabinet positions, including prospective hires to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, a beleaguered agency that the Republican businessman has vowed to overhaul.\n\nAt Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s palatial Florida estate, the president-elect met with Luis Quinonez, who runs a company with military and health care ties and is said to be under consideration for VA secretary. He also interviewed Toby Cosgrove, the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, who was a top contender to replace Eric Shinseki when he resigned from the VA in 2014. Cosgrove later withdrew from consideration.\n\nTrump repeatedly pledged during the campaign to fix the woes at the department and said he would \u201ctake care of great veterans.\u201d But he also came under scrutiny for being slow in paying out money raised for veterans groups and for suggesting that \u201cstrong\u201d veterans don\u2019t need treatment for mental health problems.\n\nOthers said to be considered for the post include former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, Florida Rep. Jeff Miller and Pete Hegseth, an Army veteran and former CEO of Concerned Veterans for America.\n\nTrump is also considering Jovita Carranza, who worked in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, as his choice for U.S. trade representative. She served as deputy administrator of the Small Business Administration under Bush.\n\nWith just a handful of Cabinet posts to fill, Trump is facing some criticism for a lack of diversity in his senior team, which currently includes no Hispanics. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said Tuesday that it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d at the lack of Hispanics considered for top jobs. Carranza was a member of Trump\u2019s Hispanic advisory council during the campaign.\n\nPence, meanwhile, met in Washington with former Texas state official Susan Combs, who served both as state agriculture commissioner and comptroller. Trump also needs to fill the Agriculture Department slot. Transition officials did not immediately confirm if Combs is up for that post.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.51317429542542, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 753, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.9772077916800006, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.38247011952191, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/as-aleppo-falls-diplomats-foresee-iran-and-isis-rise/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [960, 1963, 2184]}}, "headline": "As Aleppo falls, diplomats foresee Iran and ISIS rise", "wordcount_as_scraped": 685, "date": "20161209000000", "story_content": "Aleppo\u2019s fall will not end the brutal Syrian war, but now diplomats are haggling over \u201cwhich direction it falls,\u201d according to a Western diplomat. That is, will it be a bloodbath? Or can Secretary of State John Kerry negotiate a pathway out for the civilians trapped alongside the besieged U.S.-backed rebels in the eastern portion of the city? And could there be a way to call the surrender of that city something other than \u201cdefeat\u201d for the rebels?\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing talks that are trying to manage Syrian and Russian victory,\u201d a European diplomat said on the condition of anonymity due to sensitivity of the ongoing diplomacy.\n\nKerry spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Wednesday and again Thursday about one potential arrangement. Technical advisers are set to meet this weekend in Geneva on the matter, while Kerry convenes with a number of high-ranking diplomats in Paris this weekend.\u00a0\n\nExpectations are low, but the cost of failure is quite high.\n\n\u201cA cessation of hostilities is urgently needed to protect the civilians from Iran and the regime,\u201d former Syrian diplomat Bassam Barabandi told CBS News. He has worked closely with the US-backed political opposition.\n\nWithout a pause in violence and a pathway out of the siege, thousands of civilians holed up alongside the estimated 9,000 or so Free Syrian Army fighters will face near-certain slaughter at the hands of the notoriously brutal Iranian proxy forces fighting on behalf of the militarily-weak Assad regime. The Shiite militias supported by Tehran are feared even more than Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard -- or even than Assad\u2019s own troops.\n\nWestern and Arab diplomats tell me they are keenly aware that a defeat of the moderate rebels leaves the \u201dbleeding edge\u201d of Sunni extremism \u2013 ISIS- and al Qaeda-backed groups seeking to control Syria \u2013 up against the \u201cbleeding edge\u201d of extremist Shiite militias hired by Iran.\u00a0 The concern is that this violent churn will draw more fighters to extremist groups rather than to the moderate rebels who have been nominally supported by the U.S. Kerry has made similar arguments to Moscow in the past.\u00a0\n\nA further worry for the Syrian opposition is that the Assad regime\u2019s victory will solidify Iran\u2019s hold on Syria, which is the crown jewel of Tehran\u2019s sphere of influence in the Middle East. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s outreach to Assad\u2019s sponsors in Moscow, the Syrian opposition is now hoping that the Trump administration will view Syria as worthy of action, in order to push back against Iran. The Syrian opposition is in contact with the incoming administration.\n\n\u201cThe statements from the elected president Trump and his cabinet toward Syria are promising: he makes it crystal clear his coming administration will defeat ISIS and Iran,\u201d Barabandi said. \u201cBoth are enemies of Syrian people, and both helped the regime.\u201d\n\nA clearly frustrated Western diplomat sheepishly admitted that both the U.S. and Europe had focused too much on pressuring Moscow and too little on squeezing Iran to stop the violence in Syria. The diplomat attributed that hesitation to American concern over disrupting the nuclear deal with Iran, and European concern about squandering investment opportunities resulting from that agreement. Iran sanctions are \u201cmore third-rail\u201d than Syria sanctions because of the commercial interests, this diplomat said.\n\nThe Syrian opposition also feels abandoned by the Obama administration and its European allies who have provided what they say is little more than rhetorical support to rebels fighting Assad and ISIS, rather than their own military might. Former U.S. envoy to Syria, Fred Hof, who worked for the Obama administration, agrees. He said the White House strategy \u201cbreathes oxygen into the lungs of Islamist extremism everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe refusal of this administration to do anything at all to complicate or mitigate\u2014much less end\u2014collective punishment and mass homicide in western Syria raises a real question about its commitment to address the underlying governance issues giving rise to Islamist extremism,\u201d Hof wrote. \u201cBut if one is not going to push back against \u2018Caliph\u2019 Baghdadi\u2019s most effective and efficient enablers\u2014Russia, Iran, and Assad\u2014just how serious is this anti-terrorism undertaking?\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 5, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.17110776901245, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 655, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 11, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.11222595793, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.96946564885496, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cervical-cancer-deaths-may-be-underestimated/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4090]}}, "headline": "U.S. deaths from cervical cancer may be underestimated", "wordcount_as_scraped": 664, "date": "20170123170000", "story_content": "The number of women who die from cervical cancer in the United States may be higher than previously believed, and the risk is greatest among older and black women, a new study finds.\n\n\u201cThis is a preventable disease and women should not be getting it, let alone dying from it,\u201d study leader Anne Rositch, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said in a Hopkins news release.\n\nDue to big advances in early detection, such as the Pap test, it\u2019s long been thought that cervical cancer had made a big retreat in the United States.\n\nBut the researchers note that prior estimates of cervical cancer death had included women who\u2019d already had a hysterectomy -- which can include removal of the uterus and cervix. One in five women in the United States has had a hysterectomy, according to the researchers.\n\nPreventive screening such as the Pap test looks for signs of malignancy or pre-malignancy in the cervix, so it is only useful in reducing deaths from cervical cancer in women who have not undergone a hysterectomy, the researchers explained.\n\nTheir new calculation approach excludes women who\u2019d had a hysterectomy.\n\nWhen those women were factored out, Rositch\u2019s team found that U.S. cervical cancer deaths are 77 percent higher among black women and 47 percent higher among white women than previously thought.\n\nThe prior rate of cervical cancer death among black women older than 20 was 5.7 per 100,000 each year, while it was 3.2 per 100,000 each year among white women.\n\nBut when women who\u2019d had a hysterectomy were excluded from the analysis, the rate in black women rose to more than 10 per 100,000 per year and to 4.7 per 100,000 per year in white women.\n\n\u201cThese data tell us that as long as a woman retains her cervix, it is important that she continue to obtain recommended screening for cervical cancer since the risk of death from the disease remains significant well into older age,\u201d Rositch said.\n\nThe research also found that many women who die from cervical cancer are older than 65, the recommended cut-off age for regular cervical cancer screening.\n\nEach year in the United States, there are 12,000 cases of cervical cancer and 4,000 deaths from the disease. But routine screening can prevent cervical cancer.\n\nThe study findings emphasize the need to learn more about the risks associated with cervical cancer in older and black women, and to determine the best screening and treatment options for these women, according to the researchers.\n\n\u201cSince the goal of a screening program is to ultimately reduce mortality from cervical cancer, then you must have accurate estimates within the population targeted by those programs -- adult women with a cervix,\u201d Rositch explained.\n\n\u201cThese findings motivate us to better understand why, despite the wide availability of screening and treatment, older and black women are still dying from cervical cancer at such high rates in the United States,\u201d she added.\n\nTwo gynecologists who reviewed the findings agreed that better screening -- for all women -- is key to reducing the death toll from cervical cancer.\n\n\u201cThe disparity in cervical cancer rates between whites and blacks illustrates the difference in medical care received by different populations in the United States,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician/gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\u201cThis is an ongoing problem with many socioeconomic factors,\u201d she said. \u201cBetter community outreach for preventative care and also special attention for high risk populations may help to decrease rates of cervical cancer.\u201d\n\nDr. Mitchell Maiman is chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Staten Island University Hospital, also in New York City.\n\nHe said that \u201cevery effort must be made to insure that modern concepts in cervical cancer screening are executed. We must monitor our HPV vaccine programs with the goal of universal participation, and make sure that there are no racial disparities in its implementation.\u201d\n\nThe study appears in the Jan. 23 issue of the journal\u00a0Cancer.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.539358615875241, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 647, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.57129738613, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123170000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.6275115919629104, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-ambassador-samantha-power-on-russia-israeli-settlements-exit-interview/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [667, 1160, 1832, 4328]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 717, "scraper_regex": 778}}, "headline": "U.N. ambassador Samantha Power on dealing with Russia, Israeli settlements", "wordcount_as_scraped": 778, "date": "20170111200000", "story_content": "U.N. ambassador Samantha Power is convinced that \u201cif America leads, the world takes notice.\u201d \n\nAs she prepares to leave her post as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations on January 20 with the rest of the Obama administration, she is calling for the international community to \u201ccombat\u201d the effects of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Power has criticized his country for its repeated vetoes of U.N. resolutions on the Syrian conflict. \n\nAfter reports of unverified intelligence on President-elect Donald Trump and Russia surfaced Tuesday night, Power provided some context. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat I can say is what I see every day at the U.N., which is that the rules that need to bind countries so that we live in a more stable world don\u2019t bind Russia. And they flout them,\u201d Power said Wednesday on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d \u201cThey flout them by invading their neighbors, they flout them by committing horrible atrocities in Syria and they have flouted them by interfering in our election.\u201d\n\nIn retaliation for the country trying to meddle in the U.S. presidential election, the U.S. has\u00a0imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\n\u201cWhat [Putin] might say, if he were here, is that those sanctions are an account of why he\u2019s doing this or that. Although nothing he says is credible, just as his denials with regard to our election are not credible,\u201d Power said. \u201cBut the cause and effect goes in the other direction. Our sanctions came as a result of his decision to lop off part of a neighbor. They come in as a result of support for a regime that has used chemical weapons against its people, etc.\u201d\n\nPower said Putin doesn\u2019t seem to stand for a \u201cnew world order.\u201d \n\nFor example, if a country wants to go to war, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to play by a certain set of rules,\u201d Power said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t systemically target civilians, you don\u2019t use chemical weapons, you don\u2019t use barrel bombs. All of those norms are being subjected to challenge by President Putin and others. And it is incumbent on those of us, again, who have helped build that international order, you might have to make some adjustments,\u201d Power said. \u201cObviously, the world is more multi-polar than it was in 1945, but it\u2019s in our interest for there to be rules.\u201d\n\nPower, who has also forcefully denounced atrocities committed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, stressed the importance of the United States\u2019 role in international affairs. \n\n\u201cLook at Ebola, look at dismantling Iran\u2019s nuclear program, look at mobilizing the stiffest sanctions in two decades on North Korea in response to their nuclear proliferation. On issue after issue, we lead. And in the event we were not to lead, you would not see global responses,\u201d Power said. \u201cI live it every day on the Security Council. The issue is briefed and then everybody looks to me and says, \u2018Ok, what\u2019s the United States going to do about it?\u2019 And then it\u2019s incumbent on us to leverage what we do to get other countries to step up.\u201d\n\nLast month the Obama administration came under fire for abstaining to vote on a resolution against Israeli settlements in the West Bank. \n\n\u201cI would hope the consequence [of the abstention] is that all the parties on the ground who have not been engaged in talks on a two-state solution for some time get motivated to come back to the table. I mean, that was a resolution that enshrined in it opposition not only to settlements, but also to violence and incitement of the kind that helps give our eyes to the kind of attack we saw earlier this week against Israelis,\u201d Power said. \u201cSo we have invested a huge amount in trying to push that process along, specifically Secretary Kerry of course giving body and soul to that. Right now, there are no talks. There is only movement in the wrong direction away from a two-state solution.\u201d\n\nPower will likely be succeeded by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who was nominated by Mr. Trump in November. She said she has focused on trying to ensure the \u201cmost auspicious transition possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in touch with Gov. Haley, feel good about the team she\u2019s inheriting,\u201d Power said. \u201cNinety percent of the people who work with me stay on. I inherited them from President Bush. So at a civil service and foreign service level, there\u2019s a huge amount of continuity in our foreign policy.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, on a personal level, Power said her \u201cfirst port of call\u201d when she leaves office will be \u201clots of little league and concentrated attention on my two little children.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.72750639915466, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 717, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.5534552264200001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.09205020920502, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/celebgate-hacker-edward-majerczyk-sentenced-to-9-months-in-prison/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [3912], "\u00a0": [59]}}, "headline": "\"Celebgate\" hacker sentenced to 9 months in prison", "wordcount_as_scraped": 694, "date": "20170125190000", "story_content": "CHICAGO \u2014\u00a0A federal judge railed against anonymous \u201cintrusion into the affairs of people\u2019s private lives\u201d as he handed a Chicago man a nine-month prison sentence Tuesday for his role in a Hollywood hacking scandal that exposed nude photographs of dozens of A-list celebrities, reports CBS Chicago.\n\nEdward J.

Neither victim was identified in court.\n\nU.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras called Majerczyk\u2019s conduct \u201cabhorrent\u201d and repeatedly described the \u201chorror\u201d his victims must have felt when they realized their private information had been exposed, even if only to Majerczyk. The judge cited the book \u201cBrave New World,\u201d but said \u201cwe\u2019re living in a world that is not so brave.\u201d\n\nMajerczyk, a father who had worked as a customer service representative for Commonwealth Edison and now lives with his mother, apologized to the judge and his family before Kocoras handed down the sentence. The feds first raided his home in October 2014, and he told the judge authorities have treated him with the \u201cutmost decency and respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise to prove myself worthy of that respect,\u201d Majerczyk told the judge.\n\nThomas Needham, Majerczyk\u2019s attorney, said his client immediately told agents what he had done when they raided his home. He also said Majerczyk spent at least an hour at the FBI building in Chicago last March answering questions about the hack. Federal authorities from California joined the conversation over a secure video link.\n\nLast year, Majerczyk told Kocoras that he used a trick he \u201chad learned from another individual\u201d to access and download sensitive photographs.\n\nThe feds say Majerczyk used a \u201cphishing\u201d scheme, sending his victims emails from addresses like \u201cappleprivacysecurity@icloud.com.\u201d The emails appeared to be from corporate security accounts and would direct the victims to a website that collected their usernames and passwords.\n\nMajerczyk admitted to the judge last September that he targeted celebrities.\n\nThe feds walked out of Majerczyk\u2019s apartment in October 2014 with several computers, a cellphone, hard drives and thumb drives, court records show. The FBI also raided a home on South Washtenaw in Brighton Park, but no criminal charges appear to have been filed as a result.\n\nSearch warrant applications filed in Chicago describe interviews with some of the victimized celebrities but refer to them only by their initials. Some of the celebrities reported they\u2019d been briefly locked out of their online accounts before the leak, records show.\n\nOthers said they received the so-called \u201cphishing\u201d messages described by federal prosecutors in Majerczyk\u2019s case. Many said the photographs were meant only for their significant others. And one said she sent some of the 54 private leaked photographs to her fianc\u00e9. But she said she never sent him the others \u2014 she only stored them on her phone.\n\nFinally, an FBI agent described one interview with Lawrence, identified only as \u201cJ.L.\u201d The agent said he had to stop the interview because she became \u201cvery distraught.\u201d\n\n\u201cJ.L. stated she was having an anxiety attack and was visibly shaken,\u201d the agent wrote.\n\nLawrence said in an interview with Vanity Fair that she considered the hacking to be a sex crime.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.50070333480835, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 674, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.83134754589, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.70919881305638, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kellyanne-conway-defends-donald-trumps-response-to-russian-hacking-stories/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1139, 1863, 1891]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 504, "scraper_regex": 543}}, "headline": "Kellyanne Conway defends Donald Trump's response to Russian hacking stories", "wordcount_as_scraped": 543, "date": "20161211190000", "story_content": "Kellyanne Conway on Sunday defended President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s response to the confirmation from intelligence officials that Russia worked to influence the 2016 election in favor of Mr. Trump, saying the stories are just an attempt to \u201crelitigate\u201d the results from Election Day.\n\nMr. Trump \u201cthinks people are trying to relitigate the election,\u201d Conway told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d \u201c...First it was [FBI Director] Jim Comey\u2019s fault. Then we\u2019re going to have a recount. Then it\u2019s the alt-right\u2019s fault. Now it\u2019s Russian interference.\u201d\n\nConway\u2019s comments follow reports in the Washington Post and other news outlets -- and confirmed by CBS News -- that intelligence officials believe Russia not only worked to cause chaos in the U.S. election, but was specifically working to promote Mr. Trump. \n\nShe echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the story: in an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d he said new revelations about Russia\u2019s influence on his behalf are \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Trump said. \u201c\u2026 Every week it\u2019s another excuse. \u00a0We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College.\u201d\n\nConway called for a \u201cpeaceful transition,\u201d and suggested those unhappy with the election result look at President Obama\u2019s actions as a guide.\n\n\u201cI want to tell everybody, take the cues and the clues from President Obama himself who has not just congratulated Donald Trump as the new president but conceded to him,\u201d she said. (Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, not Mr. Obama, formally conceded the election to Mr. Trump.)\n\nConway added that Mr. Obama and his administration are \u201cthere to support this peaceful transition into democracy and I just believe unfounded accusations like this really undercut that.\u201d\n\nConway said Mr. Trump would allow a\u00a0congressional investigation\u00a0into the matter to proceed, reassuring that he \u201cwould not interfere in the legislative branch in that way\u201d -- but also said Mr. Trump has \u201cmade very clear\u201d his views on the subject of Russian interference.\n\nConway also worked to square Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on the Russia issue with his overall feelings toward the intelligence community: in the wake of the stories this weekend, the Trump transition team released a statement blasting the intelligence community as \u201cthe same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe absolutely respects the intelligence community. He\u2019s made clear he\u2019s going to put his own people in there as well,\u201d Conway said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s said is laughable and ridiculous is this entire notion \u2026 that somehow this was meant to defeat Hillary Clinton and elevate him to the presidency. Its untrue and it\u2019s also unfair.\u201d\n\nShe also defended his decision to receive the president\u2019s highly classified intelligence briefings just once a week, as opposed to daily as his recent predecessors have done, and noted she and other top-level advisers are not included in those briefings.\n\n\u201cHe appreciates these briefings but let me make very clear that even me as a close adviser and many others with whom you\u2019ll be speaking about do not have access to those top secret briefings,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that type of clearance nor should we.

It\u2019s oftentimes not worth the effort,\u201d Ken Yeager, director of the Stress, Trauma and Resilience Program at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told CBS News.\n\nIf you do find yourself boxed into a corner with a difficult and opinionated person, it might help to gently suggest the conversation focus on events and facts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of addressing issues and not personal viewpoints,\u201d said Yeager.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is very difficult,\u201d Yeager said. \u201cYou can also say that you don\u2019t want to have the discussion because it upsets me.\u201d\n\nListen well\n\nIf you do find yourself tangled in a fiery conversation about politics \u2013 that you may or may not agree with -- and you actually want to have that conversation because it is stimulating and interesting, be a good listener, said Yeager. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to agree.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of people hear about the first three sentences you say and at that point are trying out in their mind the best things to say next to convince you that you\u2019re wrong,\u201d said Yeager.\n\nGet your facts right, too, before you quote an outside source. There\u2019s a lot of false information piped into people\u2019s social media feeds that they end up using in conversation to prove a point, Yeager said. What they don\u2019t realize is that all of that information may be tailored directly to their beliefs and interests, and much of it could be from questionable sources.\n\nShow regard. Penn\u2019s Berkowitz said, \u201cBe respectful. Listen to what the person has to say and respond respectfully in turn.\u201d\n\nNo name-calling\n\nDr. Matthew Lorber, acting director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told CBS News that disagreeing family members need to avoid personal attacks on each other and on individuals they are discussing, especially yelling and spewing unkind names.\n\n\u201cPeople seem to think that raising your voice gets you heard, but in truth, other people are less likely to take in what they\u2019re saying,\u201d Lorber explained.\n\n\u201cNo yelling, no raising voices, no calling Hillary Clinton a dumb socialist or Donald Trump a narcissist,\u201d he said. \n\nYou may feel these things, but there are more constructive ways to get ideas across than using words such as \u201cNazi,\u201d \u201cbigot\u201d or \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nLorber said name-calling just causes the other side to \u201cput shields up and there won\u2019t be any productive conversation.\u201d\n\nTake it outside\n\nBe the voice of reason, if political conversation between others gets out of hand. Suggest they cool it or take it out of earshot, even outdoors.\n\n\u201cIf there are political squalls, suggest they move the conversation to another room, or remind them that there are children present,\u201d said Yeager. \n\nJust the fact that they have to walk somewhere else could put a road bump in the conversation and calm things down.\n\nDefuse anger\n\nThere are multiple ways to shift out of argument mode. \n\n\u201cHumor is best,\u201d said Berkowitz.\u00a0\n\nHe also suggests making a stop sign or a peace sign that you can hold up when things get too confrontational. You can always offer food, too. It\u2019s hard to yell at someone through a mouthful of pie and ice cream.\n\nStay home\n\nLeave the party early if things get too heated, or don\u2019t go at all, advises Yeager.\n\n\u201cWe can choose where we want to go for a holiday and this may be a holiday time when we choose not to go any place. Or, to go to a place that\u2019s good for you based on this election cycle,\u201d he said.\n\nLimit alcohol\n\nAlcohol may seem like a good idea \u2013 holiday cheer and all -- but it loosens inhibitions and can make things worse, said Berkowitz.\n\nHosts, especially those anticipating some stress between relatives, may want to limit the amount of alcoholic beverages served at any event.\n\nBe aware of the kids\n\nShould kids hear adults arguing about politics? Berkowitz told CBS News it\u2019s okay, as long as no one\u2019s threatening, cursing or violent. \n\n\u201cWith that said, [kids] under 11 to 12 years of age should not be exposed if possible. If they are, it needs to be processed with them by a parent or another caring adult,\u201d Berkowitz said.\n\nYeager said while it\u2019s important to protect young children from disturbing arguments, kids need tools to cope with disagreements and the country\u2019s current volatile mood.\n\n\u201cMy father was in World War II, in the South Pacific. My father was not able to assure me I wouldn\u2019t be drafted. My brother was draftable age. But he was able to have conversations about what it meant to serve and what it meant to him and how it helped him become the adult he became. Interestingly, he did not once share with me a war story, but he said every story ends with tears and broken hearts. It shaped me,\u201d Yeager said. \n\n\u201cWe, as the older generation, need to be willing to have those kinds of conversations,\u201d he said.\n\nLorber said the holidays are a great opportunity to model good behavior for children.\n\n\u201cShow your children how two people can compromise and respectfully listen to each other,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\nBe sensitive to those with health issues\n\nThere may be guests and family members at the feast table who are struggling with health issues, for whom any kind of emotional upheaval and arguing are unsettling. \n\n\u201cOlder, more sensitive, or tired relatives. Those with neurodegenerative diseases and dementia [such as Alzheimer\u2019s]. The mentally ill. Developmentally disabled people. For all of the above, turn the news off,\u201d said Yeager.\n\nFor the elderly, consider watching television shows from your grandparent\u2019s generation, he suggested. \n\n\u201cBuy them the boxed set of \u2018The Andy Griffith Show.\u2019 It\u2019s a form of reminiscent therapy and takes them back to a more stable time in their life. Get them a boxed set of \u2018The Carol Burnett Show\u2019 or whatever they loved or introduce them to \u2018Downton Abbey,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nBerkowitz said depending on a person\u2019s mental health issue, they can become more depressed, anxious and paranoid when tempers flare.\n\n\u201cThose with a history of self-injurious behavior and suicide attempts may respond to the stress by doing them again,\u201d he said.\n\nAutistic children may also act out and be more at risk for self-injuring behaviors.\n\nGive back\n\nIf you\u2019re heading to a home where a sibling, parent or grandparent or other friend or relative is doing most of the cooking, bring along a giving spirit or gifts.\n\n\u201cMaking a gift with your own talent and own skills is very meaningful,\u201d said Yeager. \n\nOr if you know they place more value on monetary gifts, bring a gift card as a thank you. You can help with dishes and keep their children occupied while they cook.\n\nBe thankful\n\nRemember what holiday it is and why you\u2019re all together in the first place.\n\n\u201cThanksgiving is for giving thanks for what you\u2019ve gained from the generations before you, for remembering those in your family who came before you and for giving thanks for what they gave you. Always remember what they gave you and for contributing to who you have become,\u201d said Yeager.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.574300050735474, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1245, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.0260576322, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161122120000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 7, "pct_mft_words": 2.2489959839357403, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/some-republicans-hesitant-to-repeal-obamacare-without-replacement/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [75]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 813, "scraper_regex": 890}}, "headline": "Some Republicans hesitant to repeal Obamacare without replacement", "wordcount_as_scraped": 890, "date": "20170110060000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0-- Growing numbers of Republicans showed discomfort Monday over obliterating President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul without having a replacement to show voters. Hoping to capitalize on the jitters, Democrats staged a late-night Senate talk-a-thon to condemn the GOP push.\n\nWith Donald Trump just 12 days from entering the White House, Republicans have positioned a repeal and replacement of Obama\u2019s 2010 health care statute atop their congressional agenda. But GOP lawmakers have never been able to rally behind an alternative, and Republican senators are increasingly voicing reluctance to vote to yank health coverage from millions of people without a substitute.\n\nThat hesitancy was fed as Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., among those who want to delay repeal until a substitute is ready, said Mr. Trump telephoned him Friday night and expressed support for doing both together. The president-elect expressed a similar sentiment shortly after his election, but his call to Paul came as GOP congressional leaders have pushed toward an early repeal vote, to be followed by work on alternative health care legislation that could take months or years to craft.\n\n\u201cThere are gathering voices of people saying, \u2018Hmm, maybe we should have a replacement the same day as a repeal,\u2019\u201d Paul told reporters Monday.\n\nThe budding Republican divisions come as the GOP-led Senate pushed toward a final vote this week on a budget that would shield a future bill repealing Obama\u2019s law from a Democratic filibuster.\n\nOnce passed by the Senate and later the House, the budget would prevent Senate Democrats from using those delaying tactics against the later legislation repealing Obama\u2019s statute. Filibusters take 60 votes to halt in a chamber Republicans control by just 52-48.\n\nLawmakers were also focused on confirmation hearings for the president-elect\u2019s Cabinet.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s initial hearings, committees will examine Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, and retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, his choice for homeland security secretary. Seven others were also set for hearings this week.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee planned a hearing on intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Russia meddled in the U.S. election by hacking and distributing Democratic party emails to help Trump win the White House.\n\nAmong the witnesses will be FBI Director James Comey. It will be his first public appearance before Congress since he announced just before the election that the FBI was studying additional emails connected to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, a revelation many Democrats say contributed to her defeat by Trump.\n\nOn the House side of the Capitol, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., met in his office Monday evening with top Trump transition aides to discuss GOP plans to revamp the tax system.\n\n\u201cI need to make sure that we are all on the same page. We have a huge challenge here, it was better tonight,\u201d incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus was heard saying after the two-hour meeting.\n\nDemocrats looking to cast themselves as populist defenders of a law that\u2019s expanded health coverage to 20 million Americans used speeches to C-SPAN cameras and a nearly empty Senate chamber late Monday to attack Republicans for commencing a repeal effort with no alternative in hand.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans hate Obamacare. They hate it almost as much as the devil hates holy water,\u201d No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Richard Durbin of Illinois said, using the law\u2019s nickname, as his party\u2019s planned hours of speeches began.\n\n\u201cThey certainly have a plan to repeal it, but when it comes to replacing it, they don\u2019t offer anything. But they\u2019re going to go ahead with this,\u201d said Durbin, who said repeal would be \u201cdevastating.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren lambasted Republicans in her late-night floor speech, saying that the first thing on their agenda in the 115th Congress is \u201cto shatter health care in America,\u201d to \u201crip health insurance out of the hands of millions.\u201d\n\nTonight I went to the Senate floor to tell the @SenateGOP: Repeal & run of the ACA is for cowards. https://t.co/OrEYGlv7ES\u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) January 10, 2017\n\nAmong GOP senators saying repeal should wait until a Republican alternative is ready is Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Health committee, which will be in the middle of the health-care rewrite. Others voicing that sentiment include Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Bob Corker of Tennessee.\n\nThe budget gives congressional committees until Jan. 27 to produce legislation annulling much of the health care law, though the consequences for missing that deadline are minor. Even so, Corker, Collins and three other GOP senators introduced a budget amendment Monday delaying that target date until March 3.\n\nCiting Mr. Trump\u2019s support for a simultaneous repeal and replacement, Corker said allowing more time would provide \u201cadditional time to get the policy right\u201d and create \u201ca stable transition\u201d between striking Obama\u2019s law and enacting a new one.\n\nIn a column posted Monday on FoxNews.com, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wrote, \u201cOnce repeal is passed we will turn to replacement policies that cost less and work better than what we have now.\u201d He said Republicans would replace the law \u201cin manageable pieces,\u201d not one huge bill.\n\nOn CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, McConnell said replacement would follow repeal \u201crapidly\u201d but did not define the timetable.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.01351356506348, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 813, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.43294683427, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9520295202952003, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-weighs-banning-lawyers-from-having-sex-with-clients/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "California weighs banning lawyers from having sex with clients", "wordcount_as_scraped": 706, "date": "20161127220000", "story_content": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The nation\u2019s largest state bar association is overhauling ethics rules for attorneys for the first time in 30 years, and some lawyers are unhappy about a proposal that would open them up to discipline for having sex with clients.

The proposal is part of a long-awaited shake-up of the state bar association\u2019s ethics rules for attorneys, which were last fully revised in 1987. Lawyers who violate the regulations are subject to discipline ranging from private censure to loss of their legal license. A state bar commission has spent months crafting and amending 70 rules under goals set by the California Supreme Court. Other changes under consideration would allow the state bar to discipline attorneys for discrimination and harassment even without a separate finding of wrongdoing. The current rule requires a final determination of wrongful discrimination in a lawsuit or other proceeding before the state bar can take action. Still another change would bring California in line with other states by subjecting prosecutors to discipline for failing to turn over evidence they know or reasonably should know would help the defense. \u201cThe first and foremost goal is to promote confidence in the legal profession and administration of justice and ensure adequate protection to the public,\u201d said Lee Smalley Edmon, a California appellate court judge and head of the commission revising the rules. The sex ban has divided the rules revision commission, though similar restrictions are in place in other states. As of May 2015, 17 states had adopted a blanket sex ban drafted by the American Bar Association, according to an ABA committee that looked at implementation of the group\u2019s ban. Like the ABA ban, California\u2019s proposal creates an exception when the sexual relationship preceded the attorney-client relationship. At an October commission meeting, lawyer and commission member Daniel Eaton said the current rule regarding sex isn\u2019t working, and pointed to a lack of disciplinary action against attorneys as evidence. Between September 1992 and January 2010, the state bar investigated 205 complaints of misconduct under the current sex restriction, according to an analysis of state bar data that accompanied the proposal. It imposed discipline in only one case. The current rule also forbids sex if it causes the lawyer to \u201cperform legal services incompetently.\u201d A bright-line rule would provide clarity to attorneys and remove the difficulty of proving the sexual relationship was the result of coercion or negatively affected the lawyer\u2019s performance, supporters say. \u201cIf we have a very flat guideline, it gets out of the area of subjectivity,\u201d said Andrew Servais, chair of the San Diego County Bar Association\u2019s legal ethics committee. Opponents of the ban, including the Los Angeles County Bar Association\u2019s ethics committee, say it\u2019s unnecessary and would be struck down as an unconstitutional violation of fundamental privacy rights. No empirical or even reliable anecdotal evidence shows a ban is needed to protect the public or regulate the legal profession, James Ham, another lawyer on the commission, said in a dissent filed with the commission. He added, \u201cProponents of a complete ban cannot articulate why a lawyer should be disciplined for sexual relations with a mature, intelligent, consenting adult, in the absence of any quid pro quo, coercion, intimidation or undue influence.\u201d The revisions commission modified the proposal at the October meeting to create an exception from the sex ban for lawyers\u2019 spouses or registered domestic partners. It also required the state bar to consider whether a client would be \u201cunduly burdened\u201d by an investigation of sexual misconduct if someone other than the client filed the complaint. The bar\u2019s board of trustees approved an additional public comment period on the sex ban rule earlier this month. The rules commission has until the end of March 2017 to get the board\u2019s approval for the proposals and send them to the California Supreme Court, which will have final say on the changes.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.0, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 673, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.58831897382, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161127220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 2, "MoralityGenera": 12, "pct_mft_words": 4.60624071322437, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-japanese-prime-minister-abe-making-historic-visit-to-pearl-harbor-uss-arizona-memorial/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 822, "scraper_regex": 1034}}, "headline": "Japanese Prime Minister Abe offers \"everlasting condolences\" at historic visit to Pearl Harbor", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1034, "date": "20161227110000", "story_content": "Last Updated Dec 27, 2016 10:27 PM EST\n\nHONOLULU -- Putting 75 years of resentment behind them, the leaders of the United States and Japan came together at Pearl Harbor for a historic pilgrimage to the site where the bloodshed of the surprise attacks drew America into World War II\n\nSpeaking alongside President Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe offered condolences for the lives lost here in 1941.\n\n\u201cI offer my sincere and everlasting condolences to the souls of those who lost their lives here, as well as to the spirits of all the brave men and women whose lives were taken by a war that commenced in this very place,\u201d Abe said, adding that he was \u201crendered entirely speechless\u201d when he contemplated the deaths of so many U.S. service members.\n\nAbe\u2019s visit Tuesday with President Barack Obama is powerful proof that the former enemies have transcended the recriminatory impulses that weighed down relations after the war, Japan\u2019s government said. Although Japanese leaders have visited Pearl Harbor before, Abe became the first visit the memorial that now rests on the hallowed waters above the sunken USS Arizona.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Japanese people, I hereby wish to express once again my heartfelt gratitude to the United States and to the world for the tolerance extended to Japan,\u201d Abe said. \u201c...Japan and the United States, which fought a fierce war that will go down in the annals of human history, have become allies with strong ties rarely found anywhere in history.\u201d\n\nFor Obama, it\u2019s likely the last time he will meet with a foreign leader as president, White House aides said. It\u2019s a bookend of sorts for the president, who nearly eight years ago invited Abe\u2019s predecessor to be the first leader that Obama hosted at the White House.\n\nMr. Obama also nodded to the strength of the U.S.-Japan relationship, calling Japan a \u201ccornerstone of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and a force for progress around the globe.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur alliance has never been stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cIn good times and bad, we are there for each other.\u201d\n\nFor Abe, it\u2019s an act of symbolic reciprocity, coming six months after Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima in Japan, where the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb in hopes of ending the war.\n\n\u201cThis visit, and the president\u2019s visit to Hiroshima earlier this year, would not have been possible eight years ago,\u201d said Daniel Kritenbrink, Obama\u2019s top Asia adviser in the White House. \u201cThat we are here today is the result of years of efforts at all levels of our government and societies, which has allowed us to jointly and directly deal with even the most sensitive aspects of our shared history.\u201d\n\nMore than 2,300 Americans died on Dec. 7, 1941, when more than 300 Japanese fighter planes and bombers attacked. More than 1,000 others were wounded. In the ensuing years, the U.S. incarcerated roughly 120,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps before dropping atomic bombs in 1945 that killed some 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki.\n\nAbe did not apologize for Pearl Harbor. Nor did Obama apologize at Hiroshima in May, a visit that he and Abe used to emphasize their elusive aspirations for a nuclear-free future.\n\nNo apology needed, said 96-year-old Alfred Rodrigues, a U.S. Navy veteran who survived what President Franklin D. Roosevelt called a \u201cdate which will live in infamy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWar is war,\u201d Rodrigues said as he looked at old photos of his military service. \u201cThey were doing what they were supposed to do, and we were doing what we were supposed to do.\u201d\n\nAfter a formal meeting in the morning, Obama and Abe lay a wreath aboard the USS Arizona Memorial, which is accessible only by boat. Then they went to nearby Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, where both leaders will speak.\n\nObama and Abe signed off on the visit last month when they met in Peru on the sidelines of an economic summit. Though the parallels with Obama\u2019s Hiroshima visit are palpable, both governments said one visit wasn\u2019t contingent on the other.\n\nCaroline Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, told CBS News the mutual visit is about both nations finding peace. \u201cI think that what they really are doing is showing their respect to those who sacrificed and I think that that\u2019s really so powerful,\u201d she said.\n\nAbe\u2019s visit is not without political risk, given the Japanese people\u2019s long, emotional reckoning with their nation\u2019s aggression in the war. Though the history books have largely deemed Pearl Harbor a surprise attack, Japan\u2019s government insisted as recently as this month that it had intended to give the U.S. prior notice that it was declaring war and failed only because of \u201cbureaucratic bungling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this sense of guilt, if you like, among Japanese, this \u2018Pearl Harbor syndrome,\u2019 that we did something very unfair,\u201d said Tamaki Tsukada, a minister in the Embassy of Japan in Washington. \u201cI think the prime minister\u2019s visit will in a sense absolve that kind of complex that Japanese people have.\u201d\n\nSince the war, the U.S. and Japan have built a powerful alliance that both sides say has grown stronger during Obama\u2019s tenure. There are questions about what the relationship will look like under President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Trump suggested that Japan and South Korea should obtain nuclear weapons so the U.S. would no longer be burdened with costs of defending them, a disquieting notion in many Asian capitals. But after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Abe became the first foreign leader to meet with him, sitting down in Trump Tower with the business mogul and Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka.\n\nThough no other Japanese prime minister has visited the USS Arizona Memorial, former Japanese leader leader Shigeru Yoshida visited Pearl Harbor in 1951, six years after Japan surrendered. He stopped there on his way home from signing the San Francisco peace treaty with the U.S. and others, and paid a courtesy visit to the office of Adm. Arthur W.R. Radford.\n\nOther prime ministers have since visited Pearl Harbor and the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, known as Punchbowl.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 20, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.3836548328399703, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 822, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 14, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.47053078155, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 51, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227110000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 6.2043795620438, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.63636363636}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/edgar-maddison-welch-charges-filed-against-suspected-pizzagate-comet-ping-pong-gunman/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [323, 511, 1198, 1397, 1439, 2164, 2323, 2405, 2666, 2815, 3698, 4290]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 782, "scraper_regex": 838}}, "headline": "Charges filed against suspected \"Pizzagate\" gunman", "wordcount_as_scraped": 838, "date": "20161205230000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON D.C. -- The North Carolina man suspected of firing a gun inside a popular pizza shop while investigating a fake online news report claiming Hillary Clinton was connected to a child sex trafficking ring appeared in court for the first time Monday to face charges.\u00a0\n\nEdgar Maddison Welch, 28 of Salisbury, North Carolina, was arrested Sunday afternoon in an affluent neighborhood of the nation\u2019s capital, police said in a statement. No one was injured.\u00a0\n\nCBS News justice reporter Paula Reid reported that Welch entered court at approximately 4:30 p.m. escorted by two U.S. Marshals. He was restrained at his hands and feet. According to Reid, court documents filed charged Welch with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license, unlawful discharge of a firearm, and carrying a rifle or shotgun outside the home or business.\n\nPolice said he brought a rifle into the popular Comet Ping Pong pizzeria. The bizarre rumors about the pizza joint began with a leaked email referencing Clinton and pizza parties. It morphed into fake online news stories about a child sex trafficking ring operating out of the restaurant.\u00a0\n\nOn Sunday, it culminated in violence when police say Welch fired a rifle inside the restaurant as he attempted to \u201cself-investigate\u201d the conspiracy theory known in the Twitterverse as \u201cPizzagate.\u201d\u00a0\n\nNo one was hurt and Welch was arrested.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the documents, Welch told officers that he had \u201cread online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there. He stated that he was armed to help rescue them. He surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.\u201dHe was armed with an AR-15 style weapon and told officers he also had a .38 caliber handgun.\n\nThe shooting alarmed those from neighboring businesses all the way to the White House about the real-life dangers of fake news on the internet. One of those people posting on the conspiracy theory is the son of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposed national security adviser.\u00a0\n\nEven Monday, Michael Flynn Jr., who has posted frequently on the Pizzagate theories, continued to push the conspiracy theory. He\u2019s an adviser to his father,\u00a0Michael Flynn, whom Mr. Trump has selected to serve as national security adviser.\u00a0\n\nFlynn Jr., who has accompanied his father to presidential transition meetings inside Trump Tower and lists the presidential transition website as part of his Twitter bio, tweeted Sunday night that, \u201cUntil #Pizzagate proven to be false, it\u2019ll remain a story.\u201d\u00a0\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump\u2019s team had no immediate response to questions about the conspiracy theory or the roll of Michael Flynn Jr. in the transition.\u00a0\n\nOn Monday, White House Spokesman Josh Earnest, asked about the shooting, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no denying the corrosive effect that some of these false reports have had on our political debate and that\u2019s concerning in a political context. It\u2019s deeply troubling that some of those false reports could lead to violence.\u201d The fake news stories alleging that Clinton and her campaign chief ran a child sex ring out of the restaurant have been denounced by the owner of the popular pizza restaurant. \u201cWe should all condemn the efforts of certain people to spread malicious and utterly false accusations about Comet Ping Pong,\u201d owner James Alefantis said.  \u201cLet me state unequivocally: These stories are completely and entirely false, and there is no basis in fact to any of them. What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories comes with consequences.\u201d\u00a0\n\nOn  Sunday, bartender Lee Elmore told news outlets, people in the restaurant began to panic as an armed man walked to the back of the restaurant. \u201cOne of the hosts runs up and says did you see that guy? He had a big gun,\u201d Elmore said. \u201cHis demeanor was bizarre, in that if you come in to a place to eat, you ask for a host or grab a seat at the bar,\u201d Elmore said. \u201cDidn\u2019t make any eye contact, didn\u2019t talk with anybody.\u201d Upon arriving at the restaurant police say Welch walked in the front door and pointed a gun toward an employee, who fled and contacted police, according to authorities.\u00a0\n\nWelch fired the rifle inside the restaurant, and rounds possibly hit the walls, door and a computer, all of which were damaged, police spokeswoman Karimah Bilal said. Authorities set up a perimeter and arrested Welch safely, Interim D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham said. Welch was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon. Police recovered an AR-15 rifle, a Colt .38 handgun, a shotgun and a folding knife. A telephone number listed for Welch in North Carolina was disconnected. On Monday, court records showed that Welch \u201csurrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.\u201d Comet Ping Pong is in a neighborhood of well-tended private homes and apartment buildings on leafy streets that lead to a mix of shops, restaurants.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.658739566802981, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 782, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.17802700922, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.42966751918159, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/arctic-atlantic-drilling-obama-ban-permanent/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1867, 2120]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 926, "scraper_regex": 973}}, "headline": "Obama \"permanently\" bans drilling in parts of Arctic, Atlantic", "wordcount_as_scraped": 973, "date": "20161221040000", "story_content": "HONOLULU -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday designated the bulk of U.S.-owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing. The move helps put some finishing touches on Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy while also testing President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s promise to unleash the nation\u2019s untapped energy reserves. The White House announced the actions in conjunction with the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which also placed a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in its Arctic waters, subject to periodic review. \n\nMr. Obama is making use of an arcane provision in a 1953 law to ban offshore leases in the waters permanently. The statute says that \u201cthe president of the United States may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf.\u201d Environmental groups hope the ban, despite relying on executive powers, will be difficult for future presidents to reverse. The White House said it\u2019s confident the president\u2019s order will withstand legal challenge and said the language of the statute provides no authority for subsequent presidents to undo permanent withdrawals. The Atlantic waters placed off limits to new oil and gas leasing are 31 canyons stretching off the coast of New England south to Virginia, though some had hoped for a more extensive ban that would have extended further south. Existing leases aren\u2019t affected by the president\u2019s executive actions. The administration cited environmental concerns in both regions to justify the moratorium. Mr. Obama also cited the importance of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in providing subsistence for native Alaskans and the vulnerability of the ecosystem to an oil spill to justify his directive.\u00a0\n\nMr. Obama also noted the level of fuel production occurring in the Arctic. Mr. Obama said just 0.1 percent of offshore crude production came from the Arctic in 2015, and at current oil prices, significant production would not occur in future decades.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why looking forward, we must continue to focus on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond this one sector,\u201d Mr. Obama said. Still, industry officials objected to Mr. Obama\u2019s memorandum, calling it \u201clast minute political rhetoric.\u201d \u201cInstead of building on our nation\u2019s position as a global energy leader, today\u2019s unilateral mandate could put America back on a path of energy dependence for decades to come,\u201d said Dan Naatz of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. And Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, said Mr. Obama\u2019s move marginalized local voices. He said no one is more invested than Alaskans in making sure Arctic habitats are protected. \u201cTo lock it up against any further exploration or development activity is akin to saying that the voices of activists who live in Lower 48 cities have a greater stake than those to whom the Arctic is our front yard and our back yard,\u201d he said in a statement. In issuing a permanent ban, Mr. Obama appears to be trying to tie the hands of his successor. Mr. Trump has vowed a domestic energy revolution and is filling his Cabinet with nominees deeply opposed to Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental and climate change actions. Environmental groups were calling for a permanent ban even before the presidential election, but Mr. Trump\u2019s victory has provided greater urgency for them and for businesses that rely on tourism and fishing. Mr. Trump has said he intends to use all available fuel reserves for energy self-sufficiency - and that it\u2019s time to open up offshore drilling. \u201cThis decision will help protect existing lucrative coastal tourism and fishing businesses from offshore drilling, which promises smaller, short-lived returns and threatens coastal livelihoods,\u201d said Jacqueline Savitz, a senior vice president at the advocacy group, Oceana. A key question to be answered is how difficult it will be for future presidents to overturn Mr. Obama\u2019s decision should they seek to do so. The American Petroleum Institute pointed to 2008 when President George W. Bush used a simple memorandum to remove previously withdrawn lands and make all Outer Continental Shelf lands available for leasing except marine sanctuaries. \u201cFortunately, there is no such thing as a permanent ban,\u201d said the institute\u2019s Erik Milito. But White House officials in a conference call with reporters said previous \u201cindefinite withdrawals\u201d remain in place and voiced confidence that Mr. Obama\u2019s decision will stand. Advocacy groups were already warning that they were prepared to file suit to protect the ban during future administrations. \u201cIf Donald Trump tries to reverse President Obama\u2019s withdrawals, he will find himself in court,\u201d said Marissa Knodel of Friends of the Earth. Frank Knapp, president of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce in Columbia, said he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d in the decision not to extend drilling protections to the entire Atlantic seaboard. Knapp and his group were among a number of business groups in the southeast who had advocated for banning new drilling leases off their shores, arguing that the environmental impacts would hurt fishing, tourism and other businesses the region relies upon. He\u2019d gone to Washington to meet with Obama administration officials, and believed the entire Atlantic was to be protected. The decision came as Mr. Obama spends the holidays in Hawaii. Some Democratic lawmakers applauded Obama, while some Republicans were highly critical. \u201cAs President-elect Trump nominates fossil fuel allies to his Cabinet, President Obama has instead put the interests of millions of Americans ahead of those of Big Oil with these permanent protections,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. \u201cThe extremes to which this president will go to appease special interests never ceases to amaze,\u201d countered Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. \u201cThis is not a moral calling; it\u2019s an abuse of power.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.91919195652008, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 926, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.4997048281699996, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9157667386609103, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaskan-natives-will-have-more-say-in-bering-sea-policy/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1376]}}, "headline": "Obama creates \"resilience area\" for Alaskan natives along Bering Strait", "wordcount_as_scraped": 666, "date": "20161209230000", "story_content": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- President Barack Obama responded to appeals from Alaska Native villages and gave them more of a say in the federal management of marine resources of the Bering Sea. Obama signed an executive order Friday to create a Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area that will focus \u201clocally tailored\u201d protections on marine resources. The newly created resilience area covers 112,300 square miles and stretches from north of the Bering Strait to north of Bristol Bay. \n\nThe order requires more focused federal consultation with Alaska tribes and 39 communities that line the west coast of Alaska, along with state officials. The area supports what may be the world\u2019s largest annual marine mammal migration of bowhead and beluga whales, Pacific walrus, ice seals and migratory birds. The order also withdraws from federal petroleum leasing 40,300 square miles of Norton Basin and the offshore area around St. Matthew Island, two places already recognized as important marine mammal hunting areas. \n\nKawerak Inc., a regional non-profit corporation that provides social services to Alaska Native Villages along Alaska\u2019s west coast, and the Bering Sea Elders Group in June urged Obama to give villages more of a voice to promote self-determination in management of natural resources and habitat.\u00a0\n\nResidents of coastal villages have seen dramatic changes brought on by climate change, mostly in the form of sea ice that forms later in the winter and disappears sooner in spring. Changes in ice have modified migration patterns of marine mammals, in some cases making hunting uncertain and more dangerous. Loss of sea ice also has opened opportunities for expanded cargo traffic, offshore petroleum drilling, tourism and other commercial activities, changes that that villages may not welcome and that could affect the security of their traditional food from the sea. The executive order establishes a task force with village representation that will consult on federal management activities in the area and work to protect cultural and subsistence activities. Obama\u2019s order elevates Alaska Native comment on projects such as a port access route study nearing completion by the Coast Guard. With increased shipping, the agency is working on vessel traffic control measures through the Bering Strait, the choke point between North America and Asia. The decision would require village comment on expansion of large-scale commercial fishing that could affect subsistence life, such as trawling. Agencies were directed to consider Alaska Native traditional knowledge in their Bering Sea management decisions. Fred Philip, executive director of the Native Village of Kwigillingok, said in a statement that Obama recognizes his people\u2019s need for self-determination and is the first president to require that traditional knowledge and expertise be applied to federal management. \u201cThis is real progress,\u201d he said. Harry Lincoln, a Yupik elder from Tununak, and the chairman of the Bering Sea Elders Group, thanked Obama. \u201cIt is the Native elders\u2019 vision that the northern Bering Sea and the resources that our people rely on be protected because they are the foundation of our culture and way of life,\u201d he said. Alaska Gov. Bill Walker and Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott in a joint statement said while they support Bering Strait tribal leaders who worked to provide economic opportunities while protecting resources, they have other concerns. \u201cThe State of Alaska is concerned about any further erosion of our ability to support much needed resource development at a time when the state is grappling with declining oil prices and production,\u201d they said. Messages requesting comment from Alaska\u2019s all-Republican congressional delegation were not immediately returned Friday. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and U.S. Rep. Don Young on Thursday sent a letter to Obama warning of their strong objections to withdrawing any more acreage in the Arctic Ocean north of the Bering Strait, which is projected to hold 23.6 billion barrels of oil. \u201cPresident Obama has canceled lease sales, made permits all but impossible to acquire, and excluded Arctic basins from the next offshore leasing plan,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cThat\u2019s more than enough damage for one administration.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.145985394716263, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 651, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.46843844634, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209230000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.76190476190476, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trump-executive-order-refugees-ban-international-rescue-committee-david-miliband/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1305, 1639, 1694]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 742, "scraper_regex": 790}}, "headline": "Refugee group's CEO shares concerns over Trump's ban", "wordcount_as_scraped": 790, "date": "20170128220000", "story_content": "On Friday, President Trump delivered on one of his most controversial campaign promises, signing an executive order to bar refugees from entering the United States for four months and all Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nThe order also puts a 90-day hold on visitors entering from seven Muslim-majority countries \u2013 Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The president said that these measures are necessary to \u201ckeep radical Islamic terrorists out.\u201d But this paints a very different image from the refugees who are actually admitted into the U.S.\n\n\u201cHalf of the refugees who are arriving in the U.S. are under the age of 14, so a lot of them are kids. Many of them are coming from war-torn areas,\u201d David Miliband, a former secretary of the United Kingdom, told \u201cCBS This Morning: Saturday.\u201d \u201cWe work in Syria, in Somalia\u2026 in Afghanistan, where many people are local and are supporting American troops and have been and have a right to come to the U.S. We work abroad with those people, but we also work in 29 U.S. cities where the U.S. honors its historic commitment to be a haven for people fleeing persecution.\u201d\n\nMiliband is the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), an organization devoted to helping refugees. In an\u00a0op-ed in the New York Times, Miliband chastised the president\u2019s \u201cun-American refugee policy.\u201d But he\u2019s also using this time as an opportunity to clear up common misconceptions surrounding the refugee admissions process.\n\nMr. Trump said the government would still review applications from people fleeing religious persecution and that\u00a0Christians would be given priority for refugee status \u00a0According to Miliband, the U.S. has already admitted refugees at a \u201cmore or less, one-to-one\u201d ratio based on religion.\n\n\u201cAbout half \u2013 45 percent are Christians, 45 are Muslims in real figures,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cIf I\u2019m being persecuted for political reasons \u2013 if I\u2019m a dissonant \u2013 why should I get less preferential treatment than if I\u2019m a religious minority? Actually, almost of the Iranians we resettle here are Christians.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has also called his administration to come up with an immigrant screening process of \u201cextreme vetting\u201d that would require every applicant to prove he or she will be a \u201ca positively contributing member of society.\u201d But the U.S. already has in place a rigiorous vetting process that could take up to 36 months, Miliband said.\n\n\u201cThe average is around 18 months. They have to prove to 12 to 15 different government agencies, including the CIA, that they are who they say they are, that they are going to be safe and that they\u2019re going to be productive residents and citizens of this country. It\u2019s a tough process, including biometric testing,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cIt\u2019s tougher to get to the U.S. as a refugee than any other route, be it a visa for a student or tourist or anything else.\u201d \n\nThe order would also slash the United States\u2019 refugee quota from the 110,000 originally planned for the 2017 fiscal year to a maximum of 50,000. This leaves 60,000 refugees \u2013 many whom have already been vetted -- in limbo.\n\n\u201cSome of them are literally waiting to get on planes. They\u2019ve been through the vetting process and they\u2019re waiting to be told which part of the U.S. you are going to be left in,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cAnd one of the saddest things about this situation is obviously the immediate situation of the people who are stuck in refugee camps or stuck in terrible urban conditions around the world.\u201d \n\nThe president\u2019s orders went into effect immediately. On Friday evening, two Iraqi men were detained at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the men were \u201cthreatened with deportation even though they had valid visas to enter the United States.\u201d Their lawyers have now filed a lawsuit against the president. One of the detainees was later released.\n\nIn Cairo, six U.S.-bound migrants -- five from Iraq and one from Yemen -- were also prevented from boarding an EgyptAir fight to JFK Saturday.\n\nIn addition to these immediate effects, Miliband is concerned that the executive order will send a dangerous message to the world. \n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s historically been a leader of the humanitarian system, both in terms of its welcome of refugees and sometimes in terms of its overseas aids,\u201d Miliband said. \n\nMiliband also worries this will be a \u201cpropaganda gift\u201d to those who want to do harm to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that ISIS wants more than to be able to say to Muslims around the world, \u2018Look, we\u2019re the people who protect you. America will never give you a haven.\u2019 And that in the long-term is one of the most dangerous things.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.34258127212524, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 742, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.53895273523, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170128220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.83018867924528, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-can-launch-nuclear-warhead-missile-us-military-official-warns/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1288, 3218, 3220]}}, "headline": "Official warns N.

That would include the ability of the weapon to get back through the atmosphere without burning up and the ability to hit the intended target. The official said North Korea continues to try and overcome those limitations.\n\nThe Pentagon continues to revise itscontingency plans regarding a North Korean strike, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity. The military routinely develops plans for all threat possibilities.\n\n\u201cIt is the threat that keeps me awake at night,\u201d the official said, \u201cprimarily because we don\u2019t know what the dear leader in North Korea really is after. Truthfully, they have the capability, right now, to be able to deliver a nuclear weapon. They\u2019re just not sure about re-entry and that\u2019s why they continue to test their systems.\u201d\u00a0\n\nU.S. officials have steadily expanded their assessments of Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear abilities. Adm. William Gortney, then-head of U.S. Northern Command, said in March that Pyongyang may have figured out how to make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a long-range missile.\n\nUnder Kim Jong Un, who rose to power following his father\u2019s death in 2011, North Korea has seen steady progress in its nuclear and missile programs, including two nuclear tests this year.\n\nThe country recently claimed a series of technical breakthroughs in its goal of developing a long-range nuclear missile capable of reaching the continental United States.\n\nNorth Korea is now \u201cfully equipped with nuclear attack capability,\u201d leader Kim announced proudly after the August launch of a submarine-launched missile.\n\nHe was exaggerating, but the strings of tests indicate that North Korea may have medium-range missiles capable of striking American military bases in the Pacific in the next couple years, experts say. Some believe Pyongyang may be able to hit the western United States as early as 2020.\n\nSouth Korean defense officials say North Korea doesn\u2019t yet have such a weapon, but some civilian experts have said they believe the North has the technology to mount warheads on shorter-range Rodong and Scud missiles that can strike South Korea and Japan.\n\n\u201cI think that they\u2019re struggling with getting the (intercontinental ballistic missile) program up and operational,\u201d U.S. Gen. Vincent Brooks, the head of U.S. forces in Korea, said in Senate hearings earlier this year. But \u201cover time, I believe we\u2019re going to see them acquire these capabilities if they\u2019re not stopped.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we are in a very tenuous situation, with not a lot of leverage, not a lot of initiative in terms of negotiations,\u201d the official who briefed Pentagon reporters said Thursday. \u201cAs you might imagine we\u2019re preparing for contingency operations at the degree we need to.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.8281536102294902, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 517, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.58505416129, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 9, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.7408123791102499, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.8181818181820001}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pope-francis-warns-virus-polarization-race-faith/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1025, "scraper_regex": 1082}}, "headline": "Pope Francis warns against \"virus of polarization\" over race, faith", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1082, "date": "20161119230000", "story_content": "Last Updated Nov 19, 2016 8:13 PM EST\n\nVATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis warned against what he called a \u201cvirus of polarization\u201d and hostility in the world targeting people of different nationalities, races or beliefs, as he led a ceremony Saturday giving the Roman Catholic Church 17 new cardinals from six continents.\n\nThe consistory ceremony in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica formally inducted the churchmen into the cardinals\u2019 ranks.\n\nFrancis used his homily to also caution the new \u201cprinces of the church,\u201d as cardinals are sometimes called, to guard against animosity creeping into the church as well, saying \u201cwe are not immune from this.\u201d\n\nThe pope spoke of \u201cour pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose and condemn\u201d and cautioned somberly against those who \u201craise walls, build barriers and label people.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, when asked about the plan by Donald Trump, then a Republican U.S. presidential candidate and now president-elect, to build a wall to keep Mexicans and others from illegally entering the U.S., the pope replied that anyone advocating building walls isn\u2019t a Christian.\n\nFrancis, in a message a few days earlier to U.S. bishops, had urged them to help heal a society facing growing polarization.\n\nOn Saturday, after receiving his red hat, Mexican Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes, archbishop of Tlalnepantla, expressed concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s plans, including deporting large numbers of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, soon after assuming the presidency.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t divide a family. You can\u2019t divide a community. You can\u2019t divide the world,\u201d the prelate said in reply to a question by The Associated Press about Trump. The Mexican churchman added: \u201cOne thing is the election campaign. Another thing is reality.\u201d\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s homily, Francis commented on how \u201cwe see, for example, how quickly those among us with the status of the stranger, an immigrant, or a refugee, become a threat, take on the status of an enemy. An enemy because they come from a distant country, or have different customs. An enemy because of the color of their skin, their language, or social class.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way of thinking, feeling and acting.\u201d\n\nFrancis also lamented the tendency to \u201cdemonize\u201d one\u2019s opponents, \u201cso as to have a \u2018sacred\u2019 justification for dismissing them.\u201d\n\nCardinals serve as papal advisers and someday elect popes\u2019 successors. Popes look to cardinals who share their approach to the church\u2019s mission in the world.\n\nIndianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin is among the newly made cardinals. Tobin defied the governor of the U.S. state of Indiana, Mike Pence, by welcoming Syrian refugees. Tobin in January will become archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, while Pence will be installed as U.S. vice president.\n\nCBS News correspondent Seth Doane asked Tobin if the pope\u2019s message was a political statement aimed at America.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if it had anything to do with the U.S. election because I think you can see similar movements in many parts of the world,\u201d Tobin told Doane.\n\nChicago Archbishop Blase Cupich, after being made a cardinal at Saturday\u2019s ceremony, said the church has a special role in trying to bring people together across the political spectrum. He noted that on Sunday, Masses are celebrated in 26 languages in his diocese.\n\n\u201cPeople feel disenfranchised\u201d from sharing in the common good, the cardinal said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nAnother American in the latest crop of cardinals is Irish-born Archbishop Kevin Farrell, who led the Dallas diocese before Francis appointed him to head the Vatican office dealing with family issues.\n\nAt a post-ceremony reception, Farrell acknowledged that polarization is felt within the church, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become gods on both sides - gods on the left, and gods on the right, and neither one of these are correct,\u201d Farrell told an AP reporter.\n\nThe clash of mentalities between the conservative camps and the so-called progressives chosen by Francis has played out publicly in recent days. Four prominent, disgruntled cardinals, including a U.S. prelate, Raymond Burke, who is one of Francis\u2019 most vocal critics, in a letter to the pope aired their doubts about his more compassionate approach to the contentious issue involving divorced Catholics. They fear his approach could sow confusion among the faithful.\n\nChurch teaching forbids divorce, and says Catholics who remarry without annulments of their earlier marriage are essentially adulterers who can\u2019t receive communion. In a document earlier this year, Francis suggested that clerics could decide case-by-case if these Catholics could receive Communion.\n\nFarrell, asked about the tensions over the divorce issue, appeared to be open toward the pope\u2019s prescription for more compassion.\n\n\u201cThere is no situation in life that\u2019s black and white. Anybody that\u2019s lived in this world will have encountered those situations in their personal lives,\u201d Farrell said.\n\nThe new cardinals, who pledged loyalty to the pope, come from Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North and South America.\n\nOne of them, an 88-year-old Albanian priest, Ernest Simoni, spent 18 years in prison because of his faith during the communist regime in his homeland.\n\nSince cardinals are usually bishops already, Francis bestowed a rare honor in giving that rank to Simoni, a simple priest. When Francis visited Albania in 2014, he was brought to tears when Simoni told him how he was persecuted.\n\nThe pope\u2019s envoy to Syria is now Cardinal Mario Zenari. The Italian archbishop remarked how the bright crimson hue of the cardinals\u2019 cassocks and of the square, peaked headgear evokes the color of the blood spilled by innocent children killed in the five-year-old civil war there.\n\nAlso among the new cardinals is Archbishop Dieudonne Nzapalainga, of Bangui, Central African Republic. Last year, Francis visited Nzapalainga\u2019s country, bloodied by sectarian violence between Christian and Muslim militants.\n\nThirteen of the 17 new cardinals are under 80 years old and thus eligible to vote in a secret conclave for the next pope.\n\nFrancis has now appointed 44 of the 120 cardinals young enough to elect his successor. The others were named by the previous two pontiffs, John Paul II, whom Francis made a saint, and Benedict XVI, who retired in 2013, and generally reflect a more conservative leaning on church issues.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the new cardinals and Francis took minibuses to the monastery on Vatican grounds where Benedict lives so they could greet him.\n\nOne of the cardinals, an 87-year-old bishop from Lesotho, Africa, was too frail to come to Rome for the ceremony.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.1702897548675497, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1025, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.9270201939, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 46, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161119230000, "PurityVirtue": 12, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.487804878048781, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-reince-priebus-chief-of-staff-steve-bannon-chief-strategist/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1216, 1373, 1800, 2088, 2555, 2756, 2890, 3465, 3941, 4109]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 626, "scraper_regex": 694}}, "headline": "Donald Trump taps Reince Priebus as chief of staff, Steve Bannon as top strategist", "wordcount_as_scraped": 694, "date": "20161113220000", "story_content": "Last Updated Nov 13, 2016 4:46 PM EST\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is tapping Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee\u2019s chairman, to join his new administration as chief of staff, Trump\u2019s transition team announced Sunday.

Before Trump became the party\u2019s nominee, he leveled continuous attacks against the RNC and the party\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d primary system.\u00a0\n\nBut even after getting battered by Trump\u2019s criticisms, the RNC chair remained resilient, telling \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in April that he didn\u2019t take the attacks to heart.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take it personally, because I kind of just rest in the truth,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIt matters when something is right and something is wrong to me.\u201d\n\nCBS News\u2019 Arden Farhi contributed to this report.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.07100582122803, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 626, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.84299923111, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161113220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.6741214057507996, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/syria-militants-burn-evacuation-buses-activists-say-aleppo-deal-endangered/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3379, 3380, 4155, 5069]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 503, "scraper_regex": 771}}, "headline": "Syrian militants burn evacuation buses, activists say, endangering Aleppo deal", "wordcount_as_scraped": 771, "date": "20161218160000", "story_content": "Last Updated Dec 18, 2016 1:43 PM EST\n\nBEIRUT - Activists say militants have burned at least five buses assigned to evacuate wounded and sick people from two villages in northern Syria. The incident could scuttle a wider deal that encompasses the evacuation of thousands of trapped rebel fighters and civilians from the last opposition foothold in east Aleppo.\n\nThe opposition\u2019s Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Sunday that the al Qaeda affiliated Fatah al-Sham Front burned buses assigned to evacuate people from the rebel-besieged villages of Foua and Kfarya.\n\nHezbollah, the Lebanese militant group fighting alongside Syria\u2019s government, said the buses were burned during fighting between the al-Qaeda-affiliated Fatah al-Sham Front and a rebel group that supported the evacuations.\n\nThe Observatory says six buses were burned while Hezbollah\u2019s media outlet put the number at five.\n\nSyrian media said earlier Sunday that buses and ambulances were preparing to enter east Aleppo to resume evacuating rebels and civilians from the opposition\u2019s remaining districts in the city.\n\nPro-government Al-Ikhbariya TV says Sunday that convoys were also preparing to evacuate over 2,000 wounded and sick residents from the northern Syrian villages of Foua and Kfarya , which are besieged by rebels. It\u2019s not clear what will happen to that operation after the fighting there.\n\nIn Aleppo, English teacher Wissam Zarqa said families have been assigned bus numbers and are preparing to evacuate after pro-government forces halted operations on Friday.\n\nThe government\u2019s side said it wanted simultaneous evacuations from Foua and Kfarya. Several thousand civilians evacuated Aleppo Thursday before the process was halted.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council will meet today to try to send observers to  the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo in order to monitor evacuations and  report on the protection of civilians, CBS News\u2019 Pamela Falk reports.Diplomats expect to vote on a French-sponsored U.N.  Resolution that demands that all parties provide the UN with \u201csafe,  immediate and unimpeded access\u201d to monitor evacuations from parts of  Aleppo that are being bombed, as well as to monitor protection of  civilians inside Aleppo. The U.N. draft, seen by CBS News, states: \u201cthese evacuations must be conducted  in accordance with international humanitarian law and principles and  emphasizes that the evacuations of civilians must be voluntary and to  final destinations of their choice, and protection must be provided to  all civilians who choose or who have been forced to be evacuated and  those who opt to remain in their homes.\u201dThe Resolution also, \u201cCalls on all parties to respect and protect all  medical and humanitarian personnel, their means of transport and  equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities throughout  the country.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Francois Delattre, said the resolution\u2019s goal is to avoid \u201cmass atrocities\u201d by Syrian forces, and especially militias, in eastern Aleppo, which is now defenseless following the defeat of rebel forces.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to avoid another or a new Srebrenica,\u201d Delattre said, a reference to the massacre of nearly 8,000 Bosnian Muslims who sought protection in the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica in 1995 during the Bosnian war. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nLate Sunday, Russia proposed a rival U.N. resolution that would require Syrian government approval before the U.N. could deploy any monitors to eastern Aleppo to check on civilians. The Russian draft eliminates any U.N. monitoring of the evacuation of civilians from Aleppo. It only asks the secretary-general to provide security and other arrangements \u201cin coordination with the interested parties\u201d - which include the Syrian government now in control of eastern Aleppo - to allow U.N. personnel \u201cto monitor the condition of civilians remaining in Aleppo in light of international humanitarian law.\u201d Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because consultations are closed, said Security Council members were discussing whether it is possible to merge the two texts.\u00a0\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Russia\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters as he headed into closed Security Council consultations that he would veto the French-drafted resolution unless it was changed, arguing that allowing monitors to wander in the ruins of eastern Aleppo without proper preparation \u201chas disaster written all over it.\n\nDelattre said that if Russia vetoes the resolution, France will seek an emergency special session of the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nWestern powers and Russia have locked horns on Syria, preventing U.N.  action, and Russia has vetoed six proposed resolutions on Syria since  the fighting intensified in recent weeks. The U.S. has said that if the Security Council fails to act to protect civilians,  it will propose a Security Council resolution - which would not be  subject to a Russian veto - calling for an emergency special session of  the General Assembly to take action. \u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.9279279708862305, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 503, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.97926720149, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161218160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.16302186878728, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-governor-abbott-threatens-austin-sheriff-sanctuary-cities-immigrants/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [385, 2177]}}, "headline": "Texas Governor Abbott threatens Austin sheriff over \"sanctuary cities\" policy with immigrants", "wordcount_as_scraped": 645, "date": "20170124140000", "story_content": "AUSTIN, Texas - Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday told Austin\u2019s sheriff that her jail would become the first in the state to lose taxpayer money over so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d policies unless she reverses plans to curtail working with federal immigration authorities by February.\u00a0\n\nThe governor has previously threatened other \u201csanctuary cities\u201d in Texas, and ultimately did not withhold funds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump made similar vows as a candidate, declaring that his \u201cDay One\u201d priorities would include stopping all federal dollars to places where local officials rebuff federal agents and don\u2019t arrest or detain immigrants living in the country illegally. Several big cities, including New York and Chicago, already have formal sanctuary policies on the books.\n\nNewly elected Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez on Friday - in a defiantly timed announcement after Trump was inaugurated - said starting Feb. 1 she would end her predecessor\u2019s policy of honoring all jail detainers sought by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Hernandez is a Democrat whose campaign in Texas\u2019 most liberal city partly ran on promises to change how detainers are handled.\n\nAbbott, who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, is now effectively threatening to carry out the president\u2019s promise on a state level. Abbott has previously warned local officials against adopting sanctuary policies but has not delivered such a direct ultimatum before now.\n\n\u201cYour unilateral decision will cost the people of Travis County money that was meant to protect them,\u201d Abbott wrote. He said funding would be lost by Feb. 1 unless the county changes course.\n\nCBS Austin affiliate KEYE-TV reports the letter went on to describe what Abbott thought the consequences of Hernandez\u2019s decision would be, although it\u2019s not clear it provided the data to back up the claim.\n\nAbbott claimed that those being released on bond would include ex-cons, \u201c...dangerous criminal aliens convicted of felonies like murder ... will be turned loose into Travis County without permitting ICE the opportunity to collect them.\u201d \u00a0\n\nThe only money Abbott has the power to cut off for now is criminal justice grants controlled by his office. Travis County received about $1.8 million of that grant money last year - about 1 percent of the sheriff department\u2019s budget.\n\nBoth Abbott and the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature are eager to pass new laws by summer that would impose tougher penalties over sanctuary policies.\n\nA spokeswoman for Hernandez said she had no immediate comment on Abbott\u2019s letter, but in a video posted to YouTube last week, the sheriff said honoring all federal immigration detainers ties up her deputies and sows distrust between officers and county residents. Detainers are requested when federal immigration authorities, while reviewing jail records, raise concerns about whether a suspect is in the country legally and asks for them to remain jailed so their status can be investigated.\n\nCritics contend that the system results in suspects making long stays in jails or being deported over minor crimes. Under Travis County\u2019s new policy, the jail will now only comply with detainers on murder, aggravated sexual assault and human trafficking charges. For other crimes, Hernandez said she would keep suspects jailed when there is a court order or judicial warrant issued.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to make our community less safe by driving people in to the shadows,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nAbbott similarly threatened Dallas County in 2015 over how the local jail worked with federal immigration authorities. But he never gave a deadline then and ultimately never withheld any funding to Dallas jails, and even went so far as to claim he had.\n\nHouston law enforcement officials could also ultimately test Abbott. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, who until last year was Austin\u2019s police chief, said this weekend he supports working with federal immigration agents over \u201chardened criminals\u201d but not what he called \u201cpeaceful, law-abiding\u201d residents.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to deal with economic immigrants,\u201d Acevedo said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.271084308624269, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 638, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.11407581781, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 9, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.642633228840129, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dow-s-p-500-close-at-record-highs/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Dow, S&P 500 close at record highs", "wordcount_as_scraped": 583, "date": "20161207230000", "story_content": "NEW YORK - U.S. indexes surged to all-time highs on Wednesday, notching the market\u2019s biggest gain since early November.\n\nInvestors are buying stocks that do well in times of faster economic growth, like technology and industrial companies, but they\u2019re also snapping up stocks that pay large dividends. Drug companies are taking steep losses after President-elect Donald Trump said he wants to reduce drug prices.\n\nThe Dow surged 298 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 19,549. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index climbed 29 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,241.

Julian Emanuel, an equity strategist for UBS, said investors were pleased to see that record because they see it as a sign businesses will start spending more, which would bolster economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe consumer has really been the engine of the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe missing piece has been the corporate side, the industrial side.\u201d\n\nThe Dow closed also closed at a record high on Tuesday, as did the Russell 2000, an index of smaller companies. The Russell recovered from an early loss to gain 9 points, or 0.7 percent.

Home improvement retailer Lowe\u2019s rose $3.61, or 5 percent, to $76.07 and truck maker Paccar jumped $3.47, or 5.4 percent, to $67.90. Technology companies also outperformed the market. IBM rose $4.33, or 2.7 percent, to $164.68 and hard drive maker Western Digital climbed $5.64, or 8.8 percent, to $69.49 after it extended a patient licensing deal with Samsung.\n\nBy contrast, pharmaceutical firms took a hit after Mr. Trump was cited in an article in Time magazine saying that he wants to reduce drug prices. He did not say how his administration plans to do that. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton campaigned on reducing drug prices, and drug company stocks had rallied since the election as investors felt that was less likely to happen under Trump.\n\nThe Nasdaq biotechnology index tumbled 2.7 percent, as those companies make costly medications and might stand to lose the most under tighter price regulations. Amgen lost $4.17, or 2.7 percent, to $140.94 and Vertex Pharmaceuticals sank $2.62, or 3.4 percent, to $75.50.\n\nBond yields have risen sharply this year but have slipped in the last few days. That\u2019s helped stocks that are seen as bond substitutes, like real estate investment trusts. Their big dividends are attractive to investors who want income, so when bond yields fall, investors often turn to those stocks. Industrial real estate company Prologis rose $1.62, or 3.2 percent, to $52.32 and electricity and natural gas company Exelon added 44 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $33.49.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude lost $1.16, or 2.3 percent, to $49.77 a barrel in New York.

Instead, it went to the man sitting to their left, attending his eighth and most likely his last honors presentation: President Barack Obama.\n\nWhile politics were absent from the tributes to the performers who were recognized for influencing American culture Sunday night, the arts community\u2019s affection for Obama -- and its nervousness about President-elect Donald Trump -- was palpable in the Kennedy Center Opera House.\n\nThe president and first lady Michelle Obama were introduced last, after Pacino and his fellow honorees: gospel singer Staples; pianist Martha Argerich; singer-songwriter James Taylor; and Don Henley, Timothy B. Schmidt and Joe Walsh, the surviving members of the Eagles.\n\nAfter a sustained ovation, host Stephen Colbert greeted the crowd of Washington insiders as \u201cendangered swamp-dwellers,\u201d referencing Trump\u2019s \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d campaign pledge. He joked that Obama would need to receive the honor to attend again and that \u201cunlike the Nobel Peace Prize, they don\u2019t just give these away.\u201d\n\nThe Kennedy Center Honors are in their 39th year, a period that has included six presidents -- three Republicans, three Democrats -- and all have taken time to welcome the recipients. But the 2016 election was noteworthy for the way A-list performers lined up behind Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, while Trump had relatively few celebrity endorsements.\n\nAlthough the president has no say in who receives the awards, Colbert joked that next year\u2019s honorees would include Scott Baio, Gary Busey and Meat Loaf.\n\n\u201cFor the past eight years, the White House has given us a leader who\u2019s passionate, intelligent and dignified,\u201d Colbert said, and the crowd rose for another prolonged ovation, prompting Obama to stand and wave.\n\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t even know why you stood up. I was talking about Michelle,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nEarlier, at the White House, Obama welcomed the honorees at a reception and said participating in the gala was \u201cone of the perks of the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe arts have always been part of life at the White House because the arts are always central to American life,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s why over the past eight years Michelle and I have invited some of the best writers, musicians, actors and dancers to share their gifts with the American people and to help tell the story of who we are.\u201d\n\nKennedy Center chairman David Rubenstein also thanked the Obamas, noting that the president isn\u2019t required to attend the honors or host a reception. He offered them a \u201cgolden ticket\u201d good for free admission to any event at the center.\n\n\u201cParking is extra,\u201d Rubenstein said.\n\nAnother standing ovation went to Bill Clinton, who made a surprise appearance on stage to talk about how Taylor\u2019s music resonated with him and the American public in times that tested the nation\u2019s resolve.\n\n\u201cOur nation was reeling from the pain of Vietnam,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cJames was there to satisfy our hunger for both intimacy and authenticity.\u201d\n\nPolitics aside, the honors proceeded as usual, with musicians and actors taking the stage to pay tribute to the honorees, who stood on a balcony, waving and applauding as they wore the event\u2019s signature rainbow-colored garlands. The ceremony will be broadcast Dec. 27 on CBS and CBS All Access at 9 p.m. EST.\u00a0\n\nThe tribute to Pacino included remarks by Sean Penn and recitations of Shakespeare by Laurence Fishburne and Lily Rabe. Chris O\u2019Donnell and Gabrielle Anwar re-enacted the tango that Pacino danced with Anwar in \u201cScent of a Woman,\u201d the 1992 movie that won Pacino his long-overdue Oscar.\n\nKevin Spacey gave a virtuoso tutorial on how to impersonate the actor whose passionate delivery has helped create some of the most memorable lines in American cinema. The keys are to look surprised and exhale loudly, Spacey said.\n\n\u201cAl seems to have a lot of air,\u201d he said.\n\nGarth Brooks, Sheryl Crow and Darius Rucker performed medleys of Taylor\u2019s music. Yitzhak Perlman played violin and Yuja Wang played piano to honor the Argentine-born Argerich.\n\nStaples\u2019 songs were performed by Elle King, Bonnie Raitt and Andra Day, and actor Don Cheadle spoke about the civil rights legacy of Staples and her family, who were close to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and performed at John F. Kennedy\u2019s inauguration.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still fighting. She\u2019s still singing freedom songs,\u201d Cheadle said.\n\nThe Eagles were originally selected to be honored last year, but the band opted to delay participation because of founding member Glenn Frey\u2019s poor health. Frey died in January at age 67, making the event a bittersweet one for the surviving Eagles, who were joined by Frey\u2019s widow, Cindy Frey. Henley has said the band will never perform again. Bob Seger, Vince Gill and Kings of Leon performed the Eagles\u2019 music Sunday.\n\n\u201cI want to dedicate this evening to our brother Glenn,\u201d Henley said as the band accepted its honors Saturday night at the State Department. \u201cHe was so much a part of our success.

As the suspect held a little girl as a human shield, his movements exposed him to a sheriff\u2019s marksman who targeted him through a window and killed him with a shot to the head, allowing the 8-year-old girl to break free from his grasp and run to safety, authorities disclosed Friday about the killing of Bruce R. Johnson in Tacoma, Washington.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOnce we were able to assess that the kids were still alive, it went into play,\u201d sheriff\u2019s spokesman Ed Troyer said of the SWAT team\u2019s plan to end the standoff in a suburban neighborhood south of Seattle. \u201cHe had a choice to put the guns down. We weren\u2019t about to let those kids get hurt.\u201d\u00a0\n\nJohnson was the subject of an officer safety bulletin in mid-November after he was spotted walking through the Tacoma Mall armed and dressed like a plainclothes cop, CBS affiliate KIRO reports.\u00a0\n\nThe bulletin obtained by KIRO shows Johnson walking through the Tacoma Mall Nov. 15 wearing a Sheriff\u2019s Department hat, a set of handcuffs on his belt and carrying what appeared to be a soft rifle case.\n\nA still picture taken from mall surveillance video shows the 38-year-old Johnson carrying the rifle case over his right shoulder as he walked past shoppers.\n\nThe bulletin states Johnson became irate when mall security tried to talk to him.\n\nAfter a brief exchange with security Johnson purchased some coffee and left making obscene gestures and yelling, \u201cSee, see what they are doing to me?\u201d\n\nTacoma police stopped Johnson as he drove away and spotted an unloaded 20-gauge shotgun in the front seat of his car.\n\nAsked why he was attempting to look like a police officer the bulletin states Johnson replied that he \u201cliked police and wanted essentially to fit in with law enforcement.\u201d\n\nThe standoff began Wednesday night after Police Officer Reginald \u201cJake\u201d Gutierrez, 45, was fatally shot when he and his partner went into the house to investigate a domestic violence call. Gutierrez\u2019s partner returned fire and helped get Johnson\u2019s wife safely out of the house. Other officers came under fire as they worked their way into the house and pulled Gutierrez out. He later died in surgery. Police escorted his body to a funeral home Friday as people lined the streets to pay their respects. The 17-year veteran officer is survived by three daughters and a granddaughter. A fund has been set up to help the children, and the department is overseeing another fund to help with memorial services. Police went to the house Wednesday after Johnson\u2019s wife told animal control officers that he had locked her out of the house. The officers called police. Several adults and the two children had been in the home earlier in the day, but it was not initially clear whether everyone had escaped when the shooting started, Tacoma police spokeswoman Loretta Cool said. \u201cOthers were saying the kids went down to the park, but nobody could confirm where they were,\u201d Cool said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a sighting of them the whole time, no noise.\u201d As officials negotiated with Johnson, the SWAT team moved into the basement and then to the main floor of the house, cornering him upstairs, Troyer said. That\u2019s when they confirmed the kids were still inside. Johnson had threatened to kill the children, and officers heard screaming and gunshots during the standoff, but once the officers determined the children were still alive, they executed a plan to get them out. Before they could act, the 6-year-old boy bolted down the stairs and onto the porch. Johnson held onto the girl, but the activity exposed him to the marksman outside. It only took one shot, and Johnson was dead.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.0882353782653795, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 635, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.9569919940499996, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161203050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.9370078740157504, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/alfred-olango-shooting-officer-wont-be-charged-in-shooting-of-disturbed-man-holding-e-cigarette/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [909]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 610, "scraper_regex": 645}}, "headline": "Officer won't be charged in shooting of disturbed man holding e-cigarette", "wordcount_as_scraped": 645, "date": "20170111170000", "story_content": "SAN DIEGO -- A suburban San Diego police officer won\u2019t face criminal charges for fatally shooting a disturbed black man, a prosecutor announced Tuesday, saying the officer had reason to believe he was in danger when the man suddenly raised both hands and pointed what appeared to be a weapon but actually was an e-cigarette device.\n\nThe shooting of 38-year-old Alfred Olango last fall in El Cajon was a reasonable use of force, San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis announced.\n\n\u201cThe law recognizes police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving,\u201d Dumanis said.\n\nHer office determined \u201cthe only reasonable conclusion was the officer\u2019s actions were justified,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances surrounding Alfred Olango\u2019s death are tragic,\u201d Dumanis\u00a0told CBS affiliate KFMB. \u201cThey lost a brother.\u201d\n\nOlango\u2019s shooting in September prompted days of protests and his relatives filed wrongful-death claims with the city, which usually precede lawsuits.

Bill Cassidy said Monday. \u201cAnd we mean it.\u201d\n\nHe and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, along with Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Johnny Isakson of Georgia proposed legislation that lets states keep former President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul or opt for a new program providing trimmed-down coverage.\n\nStates \u201ccould opt to stay in Obamacare. \u00a0Or they could opt for no federal help,\u201d Cassidy told reporters.\n\nThe plan offered by the four senators retreats from years of GOP cries to repeal Obama\u2019s law and replace it with an undefined Republican alternative. It comes as GOP lawmakers face pressure from President Trump to quickly void and replace the health law and as Republicans continue hunting for a proposal that would unite them.\n\n\u201cOurs is, I believe, the only bill that has the unique combination of allowing states to keep the Affordable Care Act if it is working for their residents,\u201d Collins told reporters Monday. \u00a0\u201cThat means they would still receive the subsidies, the tax credits, the consumer protections, and they would still be bound by the individual and the employer mandate.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has said he wants to keep some of the Obama overhaul\u2019s consumer protections, like requiring insurers to cover people with pre-existing medical problems. Collins and Cassidy said their bill preserves many of those.\n\nBut Mr. Trump and congressional GOP leaders have not suggested letting states retain the entire statute. Such a proposal could dismay conservative voters who for years have viewed Republican calls to repeal the law as a top-tier promise and goal.\n\nCassidy said he\u2019s discussed the proposal with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who he said is \u201cwaiting to see how this plays out.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the GOP measure would reduce care and drive up medical costs for consumers.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this proposal is an empty facade that would create chaos - not care - for millions of Americans,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., planned to meet late Monday with Vice President Mike Pence and top administration officials to discuss health care. Later this week, congressional Republicans will stage a retreat in Philadelphia at which health care will be a chief topic.\n\nCassidy described the senators\u2019 proposal as a way to help Republicans overcome a key obstacle: To enact a full replacement for Obama\u2019s law, they will need 60 Senate votes in a chamber they control by just 52-48.\n\n\u201cAt some point in the process we are going to need a bill that will get 60 votes,\u201d Cassidy explained. \u201cWe just do. If you can say to a blue state senator who is really invested in supporting Obamacare, you can keep Obamacare, \u00a0but why force it on us.\u00a0 We think that helps us get to 60 [votes.]\u201d\n\nIf states decided against keeping Obama\u2019s statute, the senators\u2019 proposal would let them adopt a program that charges consumers a high deductible and helps cover some basic medical services like emergency care and prescriptions.\n\nInsurers would not be allowed to refuse coverage to people with pre-existing medical problems, and money states would get under existing law would instead go to patients in the form of a tax-advantaged health savings account they\u2019d use to pay for care. People could also choose to buy more extensive coverage.\n\nStates could also completely design their own program but would receive no federal payments if they did.\n\nCBS News\u2019 John Nolen contributed to this report.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.16077169775962802, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 574, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.5536036883099995, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.00696864111498, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/aleppo-un-syria-army-pro-bashar-assad-forces-execution-killing-civilians/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2591, 2697]}}, "headline": "U.N. says Syrian forces murdering civilians by scores in Aleppo", "wordcount_as_scraped": 878, "date": "20161213120000", "story_content": "BEIRUT -- Syrian government forces poised for the final sweep to take the last rebel holdouts in eastern Aleppo on Tuesday as the international community and aid agencies appealed that the lives of thousands of civilians who have \u201cnowhere safe to run\u201d be spared and that those fighting to capture the rebel enclave refrain from atrocities.\n\nThe appeals came as United Nations human rights officials said they had credible reports that pro-Syrian government forces had killed 82 civilians in execution-style murders -- including women and children -- in just the last two days of the blitz on eastern Aleppo.\n\n\u201cIn all as of yesterday (Monday) evening we have received reports of pro-government forces killing at least 82 civilians, including 11 women and 13 children, in four different neighbourhoods,\u201d U.N. human rights office spokesman Rupert Colville said, according to the Reuters news agency. He said \u201cmany more\u201d could have met the same fate, but the evidence gathered pointed to at least the 82 deaths documented.\n\n\u201cThe reports we had are of people being shot in the street trying to flee and shot in their homes,\u201d Colville said.\n\nJens Laerke, aother U.N. humanitarian spokesman, was quoted by Reuters as saying Aleppo was witnessing \u201ca complete meltdown of humanity.\u201d\n\nColville said thousands of people were believed to be holed up in less than one square mile of territory -- a \u201chellish corner\u201d -- still held by rebel forces.\n\nThe dramatic appeals came a day after the Syrian military announced it now holds 99 percent of the former rebel neighborhoods of Aleppo, signaling an impending end to the rebels\u2019 four-year hold over parts of the city as the final hours of the battle play out.\n\nRetaking Aleppo, which has been divided between rebel- and government-controlled zones since 2012, would be President Bashar Assad\u2019s biggest victory yet in the country\u2019s civil war. Aleppo has long been regarded as a major gateway between Turkey and Syria.\n\nBut a government win in Aleppo does not end the conflict -- significant parts of Syria are still outside government control and huge swaths of the country are a devastated waste-land. More than a quarter of a million people have been killed.\n\nCBS News correspondent Debora Patta says the battle for Aleppo has stretched the Syrian forces so thin, that the regime lost control of another small, but highly symbolic prize; the ancient city of Palmyra, which the government vowed it would never lose again, is back under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\u00a0\n\nEarlier this year, and with much fanfare, Syrian and Russian forces declared ISIS would never come back\u00a0to the largely-gutted UNESCO World Heritage site. But the attention focused on Aleppo meant the Islamic extremists\u2019 absence was to last just nine months.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross in a statement on Tuesday urged all fighting in Aleppo to spare civilian lives. It said thousands of people with no part in the violence \u201chave literally nowhere safe to run.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order for this to happen, we appeal to the parties to put humanity ahead of military objectives\u201d, said ICRC\u2019s head of delegation in Syria, Marianne Gasser, who is currently in Aleppo. \u201cWe stand ready to oversee the implementation of any mutual agreement that puts civilians first. We cannot urge this strongly enough: this must happen.\u201d\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement late Monday that he is alarmed over reports of atrocities against a large number of civilians, including women and children, in the past hours in Aleppo. While stressing that the United Nations is not able to independently verify these reports, the U.N. chief said he conveyed his grave concern to the relevant parties.\n\nBan also said the U.N. underlines the obligation of all parties on the ground to protect civilians and abide by international humanitarian and human rights law, adding that \u201cthis is particularly the responsibility of the Syrian government and its allies.\u201d\n\nIn Moscow, which has been Assad\u2019s major ally in the war, the Defense Ministry said Tuesday that Syrian forces now control \u2018more than 98 percent\u201d of Aleppo and the rebels are holding out a neighborhood roughly the size of 1 square mile.\n\nSeveral Syrian opposition activists claimed government forces were carrying out summary killings of rebels in the streets in neighborhoods captured on Monday but the Syrian military denied the claims, saying such allegations were \u201ca desperate attempt\u201d to try gain international sympathy.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus\u2019 called for an immediate cease-fire and if that is too late, he called on the international community, European countries, regional countries and Turkey to organize an international aid convoy to people in need in Aleppo.\n\nOn Monday, staff members of the last remaining clinic in rebel-held territory in Aleppo huddled in a shelter as Syrian government forces pushed in. \u201cThose killed and wounded are left on the streets,\u201d said the clinic\u2019s administrator, Mohammed Abu Rajab.\n\n\u201cThe collapse is terrifying,\u201d said Bassam Haj Mustafa, a rebel spokesman in contact with fighters in the city.

On another piece of paper were the addresses, phone numbers and names of churches in Mayesville, Columbia and Eastover.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that papers found in Roof\u2019s car also included phone numbers for the Statehouse complex in Columbia, as well as the name of Denmark Vesey, one of the founders of Charleston\u2019s Emanuel AME Church, where the shooting that killed nine people took place.\n\nVesey led a failed 1822 slave rebellion that drove the church underground. After the plot was reported, Vesey was hanged and the church was burned. The church was rebuilt, but in 1834 all black churches were banned and members worshiped \u201cunderground\u201d until 1865, when Emanuel AME Church was formally reorganized. Burke is one of the state agents who processed evidence found in Roof\u2019s car when he was arrested after the June 2015 shootings at the church known as Mother Emanuel. A jury began last week hearing testimony against Roof, 22, who is on trial on 33 federal charges, including hate crimes and obstruction of the practice of religion. Roof has formally entered a not guilty plea to all the charges in federal court. But his attorneys have said he\u2019s willing to change that to guilty if prosecutors agree not to seek the death penalty against him. In his videotaped, two-hour confession played for jurors last week, Roof told FBI agents he left bullets in a magazine so that he could kill himself after the slayings but changed his mind when he didn\u2019t see any police immediately after the shooting. \u201cOh no. I was worn out,\u201d Roof said, when an agent asked if he thought about killing more black people.\u00a0\n\nRoof laughed repeatedly in the video and made exaggerated gun motions as he described the massacre. He wanted to leave at least one person alive to tell what happened, he explained, complaining that his victims \u201ccomplicated things\u201d by hiding under tables.  Malcolm Graham, whose 54-year-old sister Cynthia Hurd was murdered, spoke to CBS News. \u201cThis was an attack on a race of people and an attack on the Christian church and an attack on humanity,\u201d Graham said. \n\nEvidence shown in photographs introduced Monday showed Roof was essentially living in his car. Recovered from his black sedan were multiple items of clothing, food, beverages and an empty liquor bottle. There were also multiple travel brochures, a cellphone, laptop computer and a burned American flag.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, a Confederate flag, a laser attachment for a gun, empty ammunition boxes and glock magazine packaging inserts were discovered in his vehicle, WCSC reported.\n\nJurors were shown a surveillance video showing Roof buying a gun at a store in April 2015,\u00a0WCSC reported. Prosecutors also questioned a witness who detailed the process of Roof\u2019s gun purchase. Ronnie Thrailkill, manager of Shooter\u2019s Choice in West Columbia, testified that a typical background check was done on Roof when he came in to buy a Glock .45-calibur handgun in April 2015, two months before the shootings.\u00a0\n\nAt that time, Thrailkill testified, Roof filled out the standard paperwork required by federal law and left to wait out a three-day waiting period to allow time for background checks. States can add more time onto that window, but no such efforts have passed the state Legislature.\u00a0\n\nRoof had been arrested for drugs two months earlier, but Lexington County Sheriff Jay Koon told The Associated Press after the shootings that a jail clerk had entered incorrect information that wasn\u2019t ever fixed in a state database. When Roof sought to buy the gun, an FBI examiner spotted the arrest, but because of the error, called the wrong agency to get his record. Without the necessary documents, the purchase had to go through after three days, and Roof came back for his gun. Victims\u2019 families are suing the FBI for negligence in allowing the sale. FBI Director James Comey has said Roof should have never been allowed to buy the gun and promised a full review. Federal prosecutors have said they could wrap up their case as early as Wednesday. Acknowledging the role of Roof in the shootings, his defense team has been more focused on the penalty phase of the trial\u00a0that will determine whether Roof faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.6905612945556605, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 774, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.2270283409300005, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 14, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161212210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.74677002583979, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-trump-meant-when-he-said-the-president-cant-have-a-conflict-of-interest/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [790, 1474, 3226, 3548, 3661]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 840, "scraper_regex": 891}}, "headline": "Trump says \"the president can't have a conflict of interest\" - is he right?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 891, "date": "20161123230000", "story_content": "In an interview with the New York Times earlier this week, Donald Trump dismissed the potential conflicts of interest his business empire could pose to his presidency. \n\n\u201cThe law\u2019s totally on my side, the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest,\u201d Mr. Trump told Times reporters and editors. \n\n\u201cIn theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. There\u2019s never been a case like this,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019d assumed that you\u2019d have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is correct on some points about the letter of one law-- the president and vice president are mostly exempt from federal conflict of interest laws, under Title 18, Section 208 of the U.S. code.\u00a0\n\nIn October, the Congressional Research Service released a report saying that \u201cas a general rule, public officials in the executive branch are subject to criminal penalties if they personally and substantially participate in matters in which they (or their immediate families, business partners or associated organizations) hold financial interests.\u201d But it went on to note that \u201cbecause of concerns regarding interference with the exercise of constitutional duties, Congress has not applied these restrictions to the President. Consequently, there is no current legal requirement that would compel the President to relinquish financial interests because of a conflict of interest.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHowever, the president-elect could run into a problem with the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. An emolument is a fee or salary, and in this case the clause prohibits government officials from receiving gifts from foreign government or state-run foreign companies without congressional consent.\n\nThis is how the law reads: \u201c[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\u201d\n\nThis could significantly affect his business dealings. In a story earlier this week, the New York Times quoted President Obama\u2019s chief White House ethics lawyer, Norman Eisen. \u201cWhenever Mr. Trump receives anything from a foreign sovereign, to the extent that it\u2019s not an arm\u2019s-length transaction,\u201d Eisen told the Times, \u201cevery dollar in excess that they pay over the fair market price will be a dollar paid in violation of the Emoluments Clause and will be a present to Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nThis might be found to apply to foreign diplomats staying at Mr. Trump\u2019s hotels, including his newest Washington, D.C. property, which has been pitching stays to foreign officials, the Washington Post reported.\n\nAnother potential conflict arose in the Times interview with Mr. Trump Tuesday, when he admitted that he \u201cmight have\u201d spoken with British politician Nigel Farage about the issue of wind farms in the United Kingdom -- a topic that would have a direct impact on the value of the president-elect\u2019s Scottish golf course.\n\nAsked if he had encouraged Farage and those accompanying him to stop a controversial wind farm from obstructing the views at the golf resort, Trump said, \u201cI might have brought it up.\u201d\u00a0\n\nStill, there is little legal precedent for presidents to face penalties over the Emoluments Clause -- in part because past leaders have taken great pains to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest. Since 1963, for instance, most presidents have instituted blind trusts to oversee their investment portfolios.\u00a0\n\nBut the conflict of interest that the hotel could pose reaches even beyond the constitutional clause, as well.\u00a0\n\nFor use of the government-owned Old Post Office for his new Washington hotel, for instance, Trump also agreed on annual rent to the government in a contract that was signed more than three years ago.\n\nSo what possibly could be the problem now?\n\nPlenty, according to Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University who has studied the contract. In addition to base rent, the president-elect agreed to additional annual payments based on various financial measures of how well the hotel is doing. Schooner says such payments typically require drawn out negotiations each year.\n\n\u201cHow can anyone expect a government employee to negotiate with the Trump family at arm\u2019s length and treat the Trump family like any other contractor?\u201d Schooner asks.\n\nMr. Trump has said that in order to avoid conflicts of interest, he would turn over control of the Trump Organization to his children, but the president-elect has already shown an interest in keeping a heavy hand in his business dealings, even in the context of his presidency. \n\nLast week, the president-elect met with three Indian business partners in Trump Tower, the developers of a Trump-branded luxury apartment complex in Pune, India.\n\nAnother conflict could be posed by one of Trump\u2019s biggest lenders, Deutsche Bank, a German giant in settlement negotiations with the Department of Justice on its role in the mortgage blowup that triggered the 2008 financial crisis. The hit to Deutsche could be substantial, with the government reportedly demanding $14 billion.\n\nOne possible response is for Trump to make sure the Deutsche case is handled by career civil servants at Justice, and any appointee like the attorney general is recused. A career civil servant doesn\u2019t have to worry about being fired if he goes against Trump\u2019s wishes, but may still worry about displeasing bosses connected to the president.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.31023097038269, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 840, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.5536036883099995, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161123230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 3.80952380952381, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/deadly-cold-snap-eases-in-midwest-east-coast/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [441, 680, 681, 1370, 2618, 2816, 2994, 3268]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 515, "scraper_regex": 802}}, "headline": "Cold snap eases in East, warming trend in many spots expected", "wordcount_as_scraped": 802, "date": "20161218140000", "story_content": "Last Updated Dec 18, 2016 4:16 PM EST\n\nTemperatures on the East Coast warmed up on Sunday after a bitterly cold few days, and a warming trend is expected to start early in the week in many spots as a quieter weather pattern begins.\n\nAt least nine deaths were blamed on the slick roads and authorities were investigating a few other traffic fatalities as possibly weather-related. \u00a0\n\nWinter weather advisories had been posted from Denver to Bangor, Maine. Airports reported hundreds of flight delays or cancellations, interstates and toll roads reduced speed limits and authorities urged drivers to use extreme caution. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nHowever, a warm front passing through the region pushed temperatures into the mid- to upper 40s in New York, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\u201cTemperatures have soared into the 40s,\u201d meteorologist Jay Engle said. \u201cMilder air is with us today but today only.\u201d\n\nThe temperature will take a slight dip Sunday night into Monday, but it won\u2019t be as cold as it has been across much of the country, Engle said.

Another record fell in Marshall, Minnesota, where it was 31 below zero. Spencer, Iowa\u2019s negative 27 degrees was a record-breaker there.

In Chicago, police said a commercial plane slid off a runway early Sunday at O\u2019Hare International Airport. There were no injuries reported from the incident just after 1 a.m. The Chicago Bears host the Green Bay Packers Sunday at Soldier Field for what could be one of the coldest home games ever. The coldest Bears game at Soldier Field was on Dec. 22, 2008, when the thermometer hit 2 degrees with a wind chill of minus 13.\u00a0\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, extreme cold was forecast for the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and New England. The weather service said the Gulf Coast region will have below normal temperatures for a few days.\u00a0\n\nBut a warming trend is expected to start early in the week in many spots as a quieter weather pattern begins with much less precipitation nationwide compared with recent days.\u00a0\n\nWith Christmas shopping underway and holiday travel gearing up, the nation\u2019s midsection and East Coast were hammered by a winter storm bearing snow, freezing rain and often bone-chilling temperatures. The conditions spawned a multitude of highway accidents, some serious.\u00a0\n\nA tanker carrying gasoline skidded off a highway in Baltimore on Saturday and exploded. Two people died in the nearly 70-vehicle pileup on Interstate 95, authorities said.

The northbound lanes of I-95 were closed while crews cleaned up the mess.\n\nThere were dozens of crashes in Indiana - two of them with fatalities - due to freezing rain and ice. The roads were so slick that authorities had to move motorists stranded on an overpass with a ladder.\n\nIn Ohio, a Columbus woman died Saturday when her car skidded off a slick road, authorities said. In Virginia, a Fairfax County firetruck slid off an icy road while responding to a crash, but no one was injured. In Colorado, up to a foot of snow fell in places, snarling traffic.

In particular, the shadow banking system -- financial institutions that don\u2019t operate as traditional banks -- was lightly regulated.\u00a0\n\nHowever,\u00a0as Alan Greenspan admitted in testimony on Capital Hill after the financial crisis, that assumption turned out to be wrong. The traditional banking sector, which is highly regulated, weathered the storm fairly well, but the shadow banking system came crashing down -- and brought the economy with it. \n\nNevertheless, Republicans are determined to roll back financial regulation, particularly measures implemented under the Dodd-Frank financial reform package passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis. I believe that\u2019s a mistake.\u00a0\n\nDeregulation would increase the risk of another financial crisis and, should a crisis occur, make it more likely that the consequences for the nation\u2019s economy would be severe. If anything, regulation of the financial sector should be strengthened rather than dismantled,\u00a0as promised on Donald Trump\u2019s transition website.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to know for sure if tighter financial regulations have been successful. For one, the conditions that existed during the financial crisis haven\u2019t been repeated, so new regulations such as forcing \u201csystemically important\u201d banks to have \u201cliving wills\u201d designed to prevent government financial bailouts haven\u2019t been tested yet.\u00a0\n\nThe events of 2008 may have to fade from collective memory before another economically destructive financial bubble threatens to explode. \n\nBut beyond that, other regulations imposed under Dodd-Frank are designed to stop bubbles and other problems from starting in the first place. If they\u2019re successful at preventing a bubble and things continue normally, how will we know? And if they\u2019re unsuccessful, it could be many years before the problems surface.\u00a0\n\nWe can argue about whether particular regulations are good or bad theoretically, and that has value. But it\u2019s far too soon for an empirical assessment of whether Dodd-Frank has worked (and since financial crises can be decades apart, it could be a long, long time before that changes).\n\nWhat we can do is assess the risks associated with dismantling Dodd-Frank. Two questions need answering. First, is Dodd-Frank working to reduce the risk of another crisis? As just discussed, that question can\u2019t be answered empirically at this point. But I think most people would agree that it has reduced risk to some extent, even while disagreeing about how much.\u00a0\n\nThat leads to the second question. Assuming Dodd-Frank does reduce risk, are the benefits of the regulations it imposes greater than the costs?\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the benefits. As the Great Recession illustrates, financial crises can impose very large costs on the economy and disrupt the lives of untold millions of people who had nothing at all to do with causing the economic problems.\u00a0\n\nAnd the costs go beyond the hit to GDP and other numbers used to characterize the economy. Recession have large impacts on individuals, families and their hopes for the future (not to mention things like the high levels of stress). These social and psychological costs cannot be ignored.\u00a0\n\nThe benefit of financial regulation is that it reduces the chance of this happening again, and it insulates the economy if a crisis occurs anyway despite our best efforts to prevent it.\n\nOn the cost side, the worry among those pushing for deregulation is that Dodd-Frank will slow economic growth (though some would argue it\u2019s more about giving powerful interests in the financial industry more opportunities to capture wealth). It\u2019s possible that regulation has reduced growth, but if so, I don\u2019t think the impact has been very large. Plus, growth fueled by excessive risk-taking ought to be avoided in any case.\n\nFinancial regulation can be viewed as insurance against the chance of another crisis, and much of the effort in Dodd-Frank is devoted to fixing the problems that occurred in the shadow banking system. But like any insurance, it has to be paid for. In this case, the cost of insuring against another financial crisis is a small reduction in economic growth -- if it\u2019s affected at all. In my view, paying this cost is well worth the benefits it brings.\n\nReducing financial regulation isn\u2019t going to create the economic growth miracle that President-elect Trump has promised, but leaving it in place could protect the millions and millions of people who might have their lives upset -- or ruined -- if another severe financial crisis should strike again.

De Anthony Malik Harris was in the hospital being treated for a gunshot wound, according to the affidavit. \u00a0\n\nThe shootings were witnessed by a 6-year-old child who told police, \u201cNinjas came to my home and killed my family.\u201d Police did not release the relationship between the child and the couple.\u00a0\n\nA warrant has been issued for the suspected gunman.

When police arrived on scene, they found Christopher Brooks on the ground outside of the apartment building. The man had several gunshot wounds, including one shot to the head, the affidavit states. He was taken to the hospital where he later died.\n\nA witness told police he heard shots and saw three men, dressed in black, running from the home.\n\nAround 4:30 p.m. a local hospital reported that a man, identified in the affidavit as Harris, had been dropped off with a gunshot wound. Officers interviewed Harris at the hospital. He said he had been walking in the area with his friend, Franklin, when he was shot in the leg.\n\n\u201cHe was vague in details of the events,\u201d the affidavit reads.\n\nThe document states police made contact with Franklin, who gave several versions of what happened. Initially, Franklin told police he and Harris were walking to the Holiday station when they found a man who had been shot.\n\nIn a later interview, Franklin told police that he and Harris met Mann, and another unnamed man, earlier in the afternoon. Franklin said Mann asked the two friends \u201cif they wanted to make money, and introduced them to a plan to steal drugs and money from the victim,\u201d the affidavit states.\n\nFranklin said Mann told them that Christopher Brooks was expecting the 22-year-old to come over. The unnamed man, whom Franklin said he didn\u2019t know, drove them to an alleyway near the Brooks\u2019 home and the three walked the rest of the way, the document reads.\n\n\u201c[Franklin] said they stopped on the south side of the apartment complex to cover their faces with t-shirts (sic),\u201d the affidavit states.\n\nThe three men entered the home, Franklin said, and he and Harris waited in the living room with Danielle Brooks while Mann took Christopher Brooks into a bedroom. When the two emerged, Mann \u201cbegan demanding drugs and money,\u201d the document states. Franklin told APD that Christopher Brooks pleaded with Mann to take what he wanted.\n\nPolice and court documents say a scuffle began, as Mann and Christopher Brooks wrestled for the gun. Franklin said Harris appeared to try to help Mann in the fight, which he told police is when he thinks Harris was accidentally shot. Franklin stated Mann then shot Christopher Brooks several times and then shot Danielle Brooks. According to the affidavit, Franklin told police Mann likely shot Danielle Brooks because she was a witness.

And if they do shrink the risk, the effect seems to be small.\n\nStill, \u201cthose with high exposure to statins had a reduced risk of [Alzheimer\u2019s disease] compared to those with low exposure. And it varied by type of statin and for men, women and for different racial and ethnic individuals,\u201d said study author Julie Zissimopoulos. She is associate director of the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.\n\nPrevious research has suggested that high cholesterol in later life seems to boost the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease while statins reduce it, said Dr. Gail Li. She is an associate professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nBut Li, who was not involved with the new study, added that statins don\u2019t seem to help patients who already have Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe new study aimed to understand how specific groups of people might be affected by the therapy.\n\nThe researchers tracked almost 400,000 statin users, all aged 65 or older, who took the medications between 2006 and 2013.\n\nIn the study, Zissimopoulos said, \u201cWe examine individuals who have been taking statins consistently for at least two years, between the years 2006 and 2008, and follow them for another five years to examine onset of Alzheimer\u2019s. We compare them to groups of individuals with low exposure that either took statins less consistently between 2006 and 2008, or started them later \u2014\u00a0after 2008.\u201d\n\nOverall, the researchers linked high use of statins to a 15 percent lower risk of Alzheimer\u2019s in women and a 12 percent lower risk in men compared to those who had low use.\n\nThose who took simvastatin (Zocor) had 10 percent to 23 percent lower risk, depending on their gender and race. However, the researchers saw no benefit for black men.\n\nAmong those who used atorvastatin (Lipitor) the most, white men and black men had no apparent benefit, while the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s was 16 percent to 39 percent lower for white women, black women and Hispanics.\n\nOnly white women appeared to gain a benefit from high usage of pravastatin (Pravachol) and rosuvastatin (Crestor): They had about an 18 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the findings showed.\n\nAccording to Zissimopoulos, the lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease is between 9 percent and 17 percent at the age of 65.\n\nFor her part, Li is skeptical of the new findings. She eyed the results with caution, saying there may be too few people in some of the ethnic groups to come up with statistically reliable conclusions.\n\nDr. Benjamin Wolozin, a professor with the departments of pharmacology and neurology at Boston University School of Medicine, said genetics may explain the differences between the groups. As to why statins may reduce Alzheimer\u2019s risk, he said it may have something to do with the power of the drugs to promote good blood flow to the brain.\n\nAn expert in aging research, Dr. Eric Larson, executive director of the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, had another theory: \u201cSome of the variation could be based on patterns of care \u2014 how drugs are prescribed to different types of patients and also the baseline levels of vascular risk. Black men are likely to have more than just high cholesterol levels \u2014 [they may have] other conditions that increase risk and aren\u2019t affected by statins.\u201d\n\nWhat should people who use statins do?\n\nLarson said, \u201cPeople who have high levels of cholesterol and other conditions that predispose them to vascular diseases should definitely consider taking statins for their benefit in general, and can also feel like they are doing something for their risk of dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cI would not use the results of this study to guide choices of statins. Things like tolerability, cost and so forth may be more important for many people.\u201d\n\nThe study was published online Dec. 12 in the journal\u00a0JAMA Neurology.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.26666665077209, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 660, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.08100420768, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 5, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 13, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.96969696969697, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.1818181818200002}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/thornton-law-firm-straw-donor-scheme-bonuses-boston-globe-spotlight/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&linkId=30607429": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [944, 1285, 1553, 2242, 3146, 3387, 3520]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 574, "scraper_regex": 608}}, "headline": "Boston law firm accused of massive straw-donor scheme", "wordcount_as_scraped": 608, "date": "20161103230000", "story_content": "Last Updated Nov 2, 2016 12:04 PM EDT\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is returning thousands of dollars in donations linked to what may be one of the largest straw-donor schemes ever uncovered. \n\nA small law firm that has given money to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Harry Reid, President Obama and many others is accused of improperly funneling millions of dollars into Democratic Party coffers. The program was exposed by the Center for Responsive Politics and the same team of Boston Globe investigative reporters featured in the movie \u201cSpotlight.\u201d\n\nThe Thornton Law Firm has just 10 partners, but dollar for dollar, it\u2019s one of the nation\u2019s biggest political donors, reports CBS News correspondent Tony Dokoupil. \n\nBut according to the firm\u2019s own documents \u2013 leaked by a whistleblower -- days or even hours after making these donations, partners received bonuses matching the amount they gave.\u00a0\u201cOnce the law firm knew that we had these records, they didn\u2019t deny that this was the case,\u201d said Scott Allen, Boston Globe\u2019s Spotlight editor.\u201cIf you give a donation and then somebody else reimburses you for that contribution, that is a clear violation of the spirit and the letter of the law at the state and federal levels,\u201d Allen added.\u00a0Federal law limits partnerships, like the Thornton Law Firm, to a maximum donation of $2,700 per candidate. But campaign finance watchdogs say the firm used its individual partners as straw donors, allowing it to funnel money to campaigns well above that legal limit.\u00a0\u201cStraw donor reimbursement systems are something both the FEC and the Department of Justice take very seriously, and people have gone to jail for this,\u201d Center for Responsive Politics editorial director Viveca Novak said.The Spotlight team and the Center for Responsive Politics looked at donations from three of the firm\u2019s partners from 2010 to 2014. The trio and one of their wives gave $1.6 million, mostly to Democrats. Over the same period, they received $1.4 million back in bonuses.A Thornton spokesman said the bonuses are legal because they came out of each partner\u2019s ownership stake in the firm. In other words, they were paid with their own money.In a statement, the firm said:\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe would like to make it clear that the Thornton law firm has complied with all applicable laws and regulations regarding campaign contributions. Ten years ago, it hired an outside law firm to review how it wanted to handle donations to politicians. It was given a legal opinion on how it should structure its program and then it hired an outside accountant to review and implement the program. It was a voluntary program which only involved equity partners and their own personal after-tax money to make donations.\u201d\n\nThrough its employees, the firm gave to Democrats running in some of this year\u2019s most hotly contested races -- ones that could determine control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nMassachusetts Republicans are calling for an investigation.\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s about restoring integrity to a process that folks are already extremely wary of,\u201d Massachusetts Republican Party chair Kirsten Hughes said.\u00a0\n\nAllen said he\u2019s not \u201cconfident at all\u201d that this is an isolated program at Thornton.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a number of parties coming forward to us saying, \u2018Hey, they do this at our place too.\u2019 So the issue is always, can you prove it?\u201d Allen said.\u00a0\n\nCBS News has learned the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center will file a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission Wednesday.\u00a0\n\nSen.

Jeff Sessions, the nominee for U.S. attorney general, the civil rights group said. The organization held the demonstration to protest Sessions\u2019 nomination by President-elect Donald Trump, saying Sessions has a questionable record on civil rights and \u201ccan\u2019t be trusted to be the chief law enforcement officer for voting rights.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe have an attorney general nominee who does not acknowledge the reality of voter suppression while mouthing faith in the myth of voter fraud,\u201d Brooks said by phone earlier in Tuesday\u2019s protest. The sit-in at Sessions\u2019 office in Mobile, Alabama - the city the Republican senator calls home - began around after 11:a.m. Tuesday. Demonstrators refused a request by the building manager to leave when the building closed for the day at 6 p.m.  Police could be seen on video footage coming and handcuffing at least five protesters and escorted them to a police van. \u201cWe all are aware of the laws of trespass. We are engaging in a voluntary act of civil disobedience,\u201d Brooks told the officers who arrived at the scene. \n\nThe NAACP broadcast the events live on the organization\u2019s Facebook page. Patricia Mokolo, a spokeswoman for the Alabama chapter of the NAACP said the demonstrators including Brooks were arrested, but she did not know of a charge. A police spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment. \n\nThe all-day protest ended in handcuffs but without confrontation. Brooks shook the hands of the officers and the officers allowed the protesters to kneel and pray before they were led away. Brooks criticized Sessions\u2019 prosecution of African-American voting rights activists on voter fraud charges when he was a U.S. attorney in Alabama. The group also raised concerns about the future of the Voting Rights Act under Sessions and noted allegations - raised decades ago in Sessions unsuccessful 1986 confirmation hearing for a federal judgeship - that Sessions made racially insensitive remarks when he was a U.S. attorney.\u00a0\n\nSarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for Sessions, said in a statement that the nominee has dedicated his career to upholding the rule of law, ensuring public safety and prosecuting government corruption. \u201cMany African-American leaders who\u2019ve known him for decades attest to this and have welcomed his nomination to be the next Attorney General. These false portrayals of Senator Sessions will fail as tired, recycled, hyperbolic charges that have been thoroughly rebuked and discredited,\u201d the statement added. In testimony at the 1986 confirmation hearing, Sessions was accused  by some hearing witnesses of saying the NAACP was \u201cun-American\u201d and saying he thought Ku Klux Klan members were \u201cOK until I found out they smoke pot,\u201d \n\nSessions said during the hearing that the Klan remark was a joke and that other remarks were mischaracterized. What he had said, Sessions said, was that civil rights groups hurt themselves when \u201cthey take positions that people think are un-American they hurt themselves.\u201d He then praised the work of the NAACP. The demonstration marked the latest criticism of Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general. Sessions\u2019 confirmation hearings are expected to begin next week, highlighted by a vigorous push both by those favoring the nomination and those opposed to it. Former Democratic Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who was part of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund team representing the black civil rights activists in the voter fraud prosecution, on Tuesday urged U.S. senators to reject Sessions\u2019 nomination.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.030150890350339, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 566, "FairnessVirtue": 7, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.17422922602, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.886925795053, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-huddles-with-mike-pence-on-cabinet-decisions/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [437, 538, 626, 916, 1608, 2551, 2864, 2919, 3488]}}, "headline": "Trump transition: \"stalled...scrambling...on pause\"", "wordcount_as_scraped": 848, "date": "20161115200000", "story_content": "Last Updated Nov 15, 2016 4:19 PM EST\n\nBy Arden Farhi, Major Garrett and Steve Chaggaris\n\nThe state of the transition is \u201cstalled...scrambling...and on pause,\u201d according to several sources familiar with the transition. The team at this point is not \u201cup and running fully\u201d after \u201cblowing up\u201d the team, beginning with Chris Christie\u2019s recent ouster as the chairman of the transition team.\u00a0\n\nOne sign -- personnel announcements that were supposed to be made this week have been put on hold.\u00a0 Members of the transition staff are waiting for further instructions from Trump Tower.\u00a0\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Christie no longer has a role in the transition, although formally he was merely demoted to the level of vice chair, a title held by several members of the team. He\u2019s \u201cgone, not involved -- on the sideline,\u201d according to one source, as is ally Mike Rogers. \u00a0\n\nA Republican member of the national security establishment told CBS News\u2019 David Martin that Rogers was forced off the transition team because of his closeness to Chris Christie, who had been in charge of the transition before he was demoted last week. Trump replaced Christie at the top of the transition team with Pence. The other strike against Rogers, according to Martin\u2019s source, was that he had done his own investigation of Benghazi and found that Hillary Clinton had done nothing wrong.\n\nRick Dearborn, a top aide to Senator Sessions, has filled some of the void left by Team Christie\u2019s departure. His is an operational role inside the transition, researching potential appointees.\u00a0\n\nCBS News reports that Trump can be expected to name a national security team before other posts. The economic team is expected to be named second.\n\nBen Carson will retain his advisory role within the transition but he will not have a job in the administration.\n\nTom Barrack will be named chairman of the inaugural committee as soon as Tuesday. Lew Eisenberg is expected to be finance chair for the inaugural committee, and Ray Washburne will serve as one of the vice chairs.\n\nThe transition has begun staffing an advance unit that will work through the inauguration. One source told CBS that Mr. Trump is expected to hold rallies in January to build on the election result in an effort to create some resonance with the public and produce a pro-Trump atmosphere about his promises and early initiatives. These rallies -- planning for which is in disarray -- were initially conceived as a seven-state thank-you tour before the inauguration. \u00a0\n\nSecretary of State: Rudy Giuliani is pushing \u201chard, hard, hard\u201d for secretary of state, according to a source. He wants it and is the leading contender at this point. However, one source called the speculation a potential ego boost to Giuliani and his appointment has not yet been finalized.\n\nAttorney General:\u00a0Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, is under consideration.\u00a0\n\nSecretary of Defense: Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, is among those being considered. She\u2019s seen as qualified, available and Trump needs to include a woman in his cabinet. Ayotte rescinded her support of Trump during the campaign over the 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video on which Trump could be heard using lewd language about women. Ayotte lost her re-election race against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan.\n\nSecretary of Commerce: Ray Washburne, a Texas-based businessman and Republican fundraiser, is under consideration. There is at least one other candidate.\u00a0\n\nDonald Trump has been in meetings with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, as he works on filling out his Cabinet, including top national security posts. Pence was seen entering Trump Tower armed with a thick briefing book.\n\nAccording to the AP, the switch in roles between Christie and Pence has slowed Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to coordinate with the White House. Pence has yet to sign a memorandum of understanding facilitating interactions between transition officials and Obama administration officials, effectively pausing those efforts. Christie had previously signed the document, but it\u2019s no longer valid,  given Pence\u2019s promotion. And Pentagon and State Department officials say they have yet to hear from the transition team.\n\nThe New York billionaire also was considering tapping Richard Grenell as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a move that would bring some experience and diversity to his nascent administration. Grenell, who served as U.S. spokesman at the U.N. under President George W. Bush, would be the first openly gay person to fill a Cabinet-level foreign policy post.\n\nThe transition planning comes amid an intense and extended backlash from Trump\u2019s decision on Sunday to appoint Steve Bannon, a man celebrated by the white nationalist movement, to serve as his chief strategist and senior adviser.\n\nUntil joining Trump\u2019s campaign this summer, Bannon led the Breitbart website that appealed to the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d - a movement often associated with efforts on the far right to preserve \u201cwhite identity,\u201d oppose multiculturalism and defend \u201cWestern values.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan -- who was just unanimously re-has been a frequent Breitbart target.

At least one person died in the crush to escape and some of the 15 people wounded or injured were hurt in the rush out, authorities said. An American was among the dead, the State Department confirmed to CBS News early Tuesday.\n\nState officials initially said the dead included an Italian, a Colombian and two Canadians, while not giving a country for the fifth victim. The state prosecutor\u2019s office later said that only one Canadian was killed, and the U.S. Embassy told the Associated Press one of those killed was a U.S. citizen. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nQuintana Roo state Attorney General Miguel Angel Pech ruled out any terror attack, and the state\u2019s governor said it involved a personal dispute. Pech said the shooting erupted when security personnel tried to stop a man from entering the Blue Parrot club with a gun. Three of those killed were part of the security detail at the 10-day BPM electronic music festival, Pech said. The gunman apparently fled.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was thinking it was the same thing that happened in Paris, some guy just walking in and shooting people at a restaurant, bang bang bang, a terrorist attack,\u201d said New Zealand tourist Tyler Klee, who was outside the club when shots rang out. \u201cEveryone ran, everyone was terrified, looking for their friends ... We were running away and then you hear more shots fired, like you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be shot in the back or not.\u201d His friend Ben Forbes, from Australia, said: \u201cIt happened pretty quickly as well ... You still didn\u2019t know where they were, how many there were.\u201d Canada\u2019s Global Affairs Department identified its dead citizen as Kirk J. Wilson of Toronto. It said at least two Canadians were among the injured. Italy\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed one of its citizens died. Pech, the state attorney general, said the 15 people with injuries included a Mexican woman who was seriously injured. He said eight of the injured, including two U.S. citizens, were treated at hospitals for minor injuries and released. The shooting occurred near the largest exit, setting off chaos as concert goers had to scramble over a metal fence to escape to the beach. Jeffrey Castelein, 33, a fork lift operator from Belgium, said he heard 15 to 20 shots before he and his friends leapt the fence. \u201cAt first we didn\u2019t realize, and then everybody fell down and you had to hide a little bit. And then we went out the back by the sea.\u201d His group got separated and had to wait for everyone to meet back at the apartment. \u201cIt was the longest 20 minutes of my life,\u201d Castelein said.\u00a0\n\nRodolfo Del Angel, director of police in the state of Quintana Roo, told the Milenio TV station that he shooting was the result of \u201ca disagreement between people inside\u201d the nightclub and said security guards had come under fire when they tried to contain the dispute. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nPech said the shooter apparently tried to enter the nightclub about 2:30 a.m., but was denied access because he had a gun. He then began to exchange fire with another person, and festival security personnel who tried to stop the shooting came under fire, Pech said. He said 20 bullet casings from three different pistols were found at the scene, but it was unclear if the security detail was armed or fired any of the weapons. Pech said the gunman himself apparently escaped, though three people had been detained nearby. It was not known if they had been involved in the shooting. \u201cWe know of another shooting incident that occurred near the nightclub, but we are investigating whether that is related\u201d to the deadly shooting, Pech said. Quintana Roo Gov. Carlos Joaquin attributed the shooting to \u201cthe intolerance and conflict of interests between two people,\u201d and also referred to it as \u201ca personal conflict.\u201d But he did not specify what the conflict was. He said the two exchanged gunfire. Playa del Carmen has largely been spared the violence that has hit other parts of Mexico. The state tourism department said the shooting was an \u201cisolated act of violence\u201d and stressed that \u201cthe situation in Playa del Carmen is under control and Mexican and foreign tourists can feel protected and safe.\u201d Without providing nationalities, the state government gave the names of three of those killed. They included Kirk Wilson, who the state identified as the BPM security supervisor at the Blue Parrot, and Daniel Pessina and Rafael Antonio Penaloza Vega.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.35660839080811, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 740, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 11, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.7261639148900003, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.64864864864865, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/iraqi-forces-face-heavy-fight-from-isis-near-mosul/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [68]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 876, "scraper_regex": 925}}, "headline": "Iraqi forces hit with intense fight from ISIS near Mosul", "wordcount_as_scraped": 925, "date": "20161105030000", "story_content": "MOSUL, Iraq \u00a0-- Iraqi special forces launched a two-pronged assault deeper into Mosul\u2019s urban center on Friday, unleashing the most intense street battles against Islamic State militants since the offensive began nearly three weeks ago. Smoke rose across eastern neighborhoods of Iraq\u2019s second-largest city as heavy fighting continued after sundown, with explosions and machine gun fire echoing in the streets as mosques called for evening prayer. More than 3,000 Iraqi troops took part in the assault under heavy U.S.-led coalition air support, but the pace of the fight also slowed as Iraqi forces moved from fighting in more rural areas with few civilians to the tight, narrow streets of Mosul proper. Sniper fire repeatedly stalled the advance, as commanders called in airstrikes or artillery support after coming under fire. \n\nAs the operation got underway, columns of armored vehicles wound through the desert, pushing through dirt berms and drawing heavy fire as they closed in on the middle-class Tahrir and Zahara districts. The area was once named after former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Seven suicide attackers in explosives-laden vehicles barreled toward the troops, with two getting through and detonating their charges, Lt. Col. Muhanad al-Timimi told The Associated Press. The others were destroyed, including a bulldozer that was hit by an airstrike from the U.S.-led coalition supporting the offensive. At least seven special forces troops were killed and an officer and three soldiers were wounded, said an Iraqi military officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to brief reporters. \u201cThe operation is going well, but it\u2019s slow. These kinds of advances are always slow,\u201d said Iraqi special forces Capt. Malik Hameed, as ISIS fighters could be seen running in the distance to reposition themselves. \u201cIf we tried to go any faster we would take even more injuries.\u201d An Iraqi television journalist traveling in a Humvee was wounded in one of the suicide car bomb attacks. Earlier, at the eastern approach to the city\u2019s urban center, militants holed up in a building fired a rocket at an Iraqi Abrams tank, disabling it and sending its crew fleeing from the smoking vehicle. The advance in that area then stalled. \n\nThe push began as dawn broke with artillery and mortar strikes on the Aden, Tahrir, and Quds districts, just west of the special forces\u2019 footholds in the Gogjali and Karama neighborhoods, al-Timimi said. On the heels of the special forces advances, the Iraqi army\u2019s ninth division moved into the eastern Intisar neighborhood, said an officer from the unit who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. On Tuesday, Iraqi troops entered the city limits for the first time in more than two years, after a demoralized Iraqi army fled in the face of the Islamic State group\u2019s 2014 blitz across large swaths of territory in Iraq and neighboring Syria. \n\nThe operation to retake Mosul is expected to take weeks if not months. Moving from neighborhood to neighborhood in house-to-house battles through dense warrens of booby-trapped buildings is time consuming and Iraq\u2019s military has repeatedly opted for slower operations in an effort to minimize casualties. Some 1 million civilians still remain in the city, complicating the advance. ISIS militants have driven thousands of residents deeper into the city\u2019s built-up areas to be used as human shields, while hundreds of others have fled toward government-controlled territory and thousands have fled west into Syria. Just a few miles (kilometers) from Friday\u2019s operation, dozens of cars queued up on the road to camps for displaced Mosul residents. \u201cWe suffered and there was bombing and heavy shelling. We didn\u2019t feel safe,\u201d said Mahmoud Mahdi, who was fleeing the now government-held Gogjali neighborhood. \u201cEverybody is displaced and walking around in this heat. It is exhausting.\u201d Mosul is the last major ISIS stronghold in Iraq, and expelling the militant group from the city would be a major blow to the survival of its self-declared \u201ccaliphate\u201d that stretches into Syria. Iraqi forces have made uneven progress in closing in on the city since the operation began on Oct. 17. Advances have been slower from the south, with government troops still some 20 miles (35 kilometers) away. Kurdish fighters and Iraqi army units are deployed to the north, while government-sanctioned Shiite militias are sweeping in from the west to try to cut off any ISIS escape route. As the sun began to set Friday, special forces troops fanned out across the city blocks retaken in the fighting. Guided by intelligence from U.S.-led coalition surveillance of the area, they knocked on the doors of homes where they believed civilians were living. Moving from street to street, Capt. Hameed and his men found four families and an elderly couple in the sector they were assigned to clear. After sweeping the rooms for weapons, they questioned the male heads of household. \u201cWho were the ISIS fighters responsible for this neighborhood?\u201d special forces Maj. Ahmed al-Mamouri asked an elderly man. \u201cThey were Arabs, but not Iraqi. Foreign,\u201d the man said pointing to the houses where the fighters lived and worked. As his children served the Iraqi soldiers tea, the man described where and when he saw the ISIS militants flee and the weapons they had. Al-Mamouri pulled out satellite images of central Mosul and asked the man to identify checkpoints and buildings where he believed the fighters were making explosives. \u201cThis is all to help with our operation moving forward,\u201d al-Mamouri said. \u201cThis is almost more important than the clashes.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.4838371276855495, "HarmVice": 17, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 876, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.788070575369999, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161105030000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 2.85388127853881, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-new-approach-on-immigrant-children-divides-republicans/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 727, "scraper_regex": 785}}, "headline": "Trump's new approach on immigrant children divides Republicans", "wordcount_as_scraped": 785, "date": "20161208160000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cwork something out\u201d for immigrants brought here illegally as kids is dividing fellow Republicans, underscoring how difficult it will be for Congress to take any action on immigration, whether it\u2019s building a wall or dealing with immigrant youths.\n\nComplicating matters, the president-elect\u2019s advisers worked to walk back his comments almost as soon as they were published, with one transition aide demanding anonymity to deny that Trump intended to set any new policy.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks about the young immigrants, known to their supporters as \u201cDreamers,\u201d came in a Time magazine interview in connection with his designation as \u201cPerson of the Year.\u201d\n\nDuring the campaign Trump pledged to \u201cimmediately terminate\u201d President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, including the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, which has extended work permits and temporary deportation relief to more than 700,000 immigrants brought illegally to this country as youths.\n\nBut in the interview published Wednesday he adopted a far more sympathetic tone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey got brought here at a very young age, they\u2019ve worked here, they\u2019ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they\u2019re in never-never land because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nTrump did not offer details, and Time said that he did not back off his pledge to undo Obama\u2019s executive actions.\n\nBut Republicans who\u2019ve supported congressional action to help immigrant youths welcomed Trump\u2019s new tone.\n\n\u201cI can tell you I\u2019m very relieved at his comments today and I think folks back home in my district and across the country are going to be very relieved as well,\u201d said Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo. \u201cObviously Dreamers is one part of the equation, I clearly hope we do more. But I think that\u2019s got to be the top priority to do.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments were also welcomed by some Democrats, who\u2019ve been lobbying Obama to issue pardons to young immigrants as a way to protect them against any policy changes by Trump.\n\nFor immigration hard-liners, on the other hand, Trump\u2019s comments set off alarm bells.\n\n\u201cWe have an obligation to restore the rule of law and you can\u2019t do that while you\u2019re rewarding people who break it,\u201d said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. \u201cIt\u2019s the principle of the rule of law that\u2019s at stake and I\u2019m hopeful that prudent heads will prevail.\u201d\n\nBecause immigrants must reapply for DACA and work permits every two years, even if he doesn\u2019t proactively undo DACA Trump could effectively cancel out the program over time by taking no action to renew it. But a transition aide, demanding anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record, downplayed Trump\u2019s comments and said his original promise to roll back Obama\u2019s executive actions stood.\n\nObama announced the DACA program after Congress failed to pass legislation giving a path to legal status for Dreamers.\n\nSubsequently, a comprehensive, bipartisan bill passed the Senate in 2013, but it stalled in the GOP-controlled House. Obama ultimately took another, broader, executive action, aimed mostly at protecting adult immigrants with U.S. citizen children, but that one got blocked in court.\n\nLawmakers\u2019 repeated failures during the Obama administration to come together on immigration overhaul legislation leaves it uncertain whether Congress will be able to pass anything at all on the divisive topic with Trump in the White House, despite his tough campaign rhetoric about building a border wall and ousting criminal immigrants. Trump could take some steps on his own, but would need Congress for major policy changes, including any permanent protections for Dreamers.\n\nSens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., planned to introduce a bill Thursday to address status for Dreamers.\n\nHouse Republicans want to pass a border security bill to make good on Trump\u2019s repeated campaign promises to build a wall on the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border, but key lawmakers and Trump himself have already suggested that it could end up including fencing or a \u201cvirtual\u201d wall that falls short of the big wall Trump promised Mexico would pay for.\n\nAnd even if a border security bill does pass the House, Senate Democrats are likely to balk at passing it without also taking steps to offer legal status to the 11 million immigrants living in this country illegally, something that House Republicans could reject in turn.\n\nThe opposing views suggest that, despite the prominence of immigration as an issue in the presidential campaign, inaction may be the likeliest end result on Capitol Hill.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.35970330238342, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 727, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.65326686984, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 16, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.63961485557084, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/flabby-heart-keeps-pumping-with-squeeze-from-robotic-sleeve/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 613, "scraper_regex": 659}}, "headline": "Next-gen medicine: Robotic \"sleeve\" to keep flabby hearts pumping", "wordcount_as_scraped": 659, "date": "20170118220000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON -- Scientists are developing a robotic sleeve that can encase a flabby diseased heart and gently squeeze to keep it pumping.\n\nSo far it\u2019s been tested only in animals, improving blood flow in pigs. But this \u201csoft robotic\u201d device mimics the natural movements of a beating heart, a strategy for next-generation treatments of deadly heart failure.\n\nThe key: A team from Harvard University and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital wound artificial muscles into the thin silicone sleeve, so that it alternately compresses, twists and relaxes in synchrony with the heart tissue underneath.\n\nIt\u2019s a dramatically different approach than today\u2019s therapies and, if it eventually is proven in people, it might offer a new alternative to heart transplants or maybe even aid in recovery.\n\n\u201cYou can customize the function of the assist device to meet the individual needs of that heart,\u201d said Dr. Frank Pigula, a cardiac surgeon who, while at Boston Children\u2019s, took the idea to Harvard colleagues developing soft robotics.\n\nMore than 5 million Americans, and 41 million people worldwide, suffer heart failure, a number growing as the population ages. A heart left damaged by a heart attack, high blood pressure or other conditions becomes progressively weaker and unable to pump properly.\n\nFor severe cases, the only options are a scarce heart transplant or battery-powered mechanical pumps that are implanted into the chest to take over the job of pumping blood. These VADs, ventricular assist devices, prolong life, but running blood through the machinery can leave patients at risk of blood clots, strokes and bleeding.\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t be a risk with the robotic sleeve.\n\n\u201cThe nice thing about this is it can go on the outside of the heart, so it doesn\u2019t have to contact blood at all,\u201d said Harvard associate engineering professor Conor Walsh, senior author of the research published Wednesday.\n\nUnlike with traditional rigid medical devices, the soft robotics approach allowed design of a sleeve that could fit snugly over a heart\u2019s irregular surfaces. It moves thanks to artificial muscles, a concept developed in the polio era that\u2019s now being used in robotics. They\u2019re powered by pressurized air that would have to be carried in a pump in a backpack or fanny pack much like the batteries that power today\u2019s VADs.\n\nThe researchers programmed the robotic sleeve to move in the same pattern as the weakened heart muscle it surrounds while strengthening and optimizing each heartbeat. The device can be tailored to compress different sections of the heart.\n\nAnd importantly, as the sleeve relaxes, it helps the damaged heart better expand and refill with blood ready to be pumped out with the next heartbeat, said Pigula, who is now with the University of Louisville.\n\nThe big test: The sleeve restored normal blood flow in six pigs that had been put into heart failure, Walsh\u2019s team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nThe experiments were short, lasting only a few hours, and more research to test how long animals could live safely with the implanted sleeve is crucial before it ever could be studied in people, Walsh cautioned. He\u2019d also like to study if physically moving damaged heart muscle -- essentially exercising it -- might spur it to heal and require less assistance from the sleeve over time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite impressed with where this research is going,\u201d said Dr. Christopher O\u2019Connor, chief executive of the Inova Heart and Vascular Institute in suburban Washington, who wasn\u2019t involved with the sleeve\u2019s development.\n\nResearchers have previously tried \u201csocks\u201d and other ways to encase or compress the heart with little success.\n\nUnlike those prior attempts, the new sleeve is \u201csmart, it\u2019s robotic,\u201d said O\u2019Connor, who edits an American College of Cardiology heart failure journal. \u201cThey really worked on developing a device that can mimic the contraction of the weakened heart muscle and augment it so there is improved heart function without the theoretical clot risk.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.30257186293602, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 613, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.01235851102, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.44698205546493, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/doj-announces-collaborative-review-of-st-anthony-police-department-after-philando-castile-shooting/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2331]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 567, "scraper_regex": 605}}, "headline": "DOJ announces \"collaborative review\" of Minn. police department after shooting", "wordcount_as_scraped": 605, "date": "20161215230000", "story_content": "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Department of Justice will review a suburban St. Paul, Minnesota, police department, more than five months after an officer fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services announced its collaboartive review of the St. Anthony Police Department on Thursday. The city of St. Anthony said in October that it had asked for the review and to be included in an initiative to help cities build trust between law enforcement officers and citizens.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the Justice Department coming in and taking a look at our department, assessing what we\u2019re doing right as well as what we\u2019re doing wrong, so we can be better in serving the community we police,\u201d St. Anthony police chief Jon Mangseth said at a Thursday press conference.\n\nIt\u2019s expected that the review will bring additional resources to St. Anthony, and help the city identify ways it can make changes to address issues of bias and accountability. Once an initial assessment is complete -- expected within eight to 10 months -- the DOJ will release a public report detailing findings along with recommendations to improve the department, Community Oriented Policing Services Offices director Ronald Davis said Thursday. For 18 months following, the office will work with the department to help implement the recommendations, Davis said.\n\nDavis applauded the department for requesting the review.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of courage to ask for this,\u201d he said.\n\nCastile, who was black, was killed on July 6 during a traffic stop in the nearby suburb of Falcon Heights. The shooting\u2019s gruesome aftermath was streamed live on Facebook by his girlfriend, who was in the car at the time. Prosecutors said the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was shot at seven times after he told an officer he was armed and had a license to carry.\n\nCastile\u2019s family has claimed he was profiled because of his race, and his death renewed concerns about how law enforcement officers interact with minorities.\n\nSt. Anthony police Officer Jeronimo Yanez, who is Latino, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. When they announced the charges, prosecutors said Yanez acted unreasonably and was not justified in using deadly force.\u00a0 Yanez has not yet formally entered a plea, but his attorneys have said he intends to plead not guilty.\n\nSt. Anthony provides police services for neighboring Falcon Heights and Lauderdale. Arrest data analyzed by The Associated Press in the days after Castile\u2019s death showed St. Anthony police disproportionately arrested African-Americans in those areas.\n\nCensus data shows just 7 percent of residents in St. Anthony, Lauderdale and Falcon Heights are black. Arrest data for the first half of 2016 showed that nearly half of all arrests made by St. Anthony officers were of African-Americans. All told, roughly 38 percent of the people arrested by the St. Anthony Police Department since 2011 have been black.\n\nSince Castile\u2019s shooting, the city has been working on improving relations between police officers and the community. In October, the city said that participating in the DOJ\u2019s program would give St. Anthony access to work done in other cities, and would bring more resources and technical help to St. Anthony\u2019s efforts.\n\nThe review will assess the department\u2019s policies and practices regarding police interaction with the public, traffic stops, and recruitment and hiring, according to the DOJ.\n\nThe Community Oriented Policing Services office has conducted reviews of departments around the country, including in Milwaukee, after a white police officer fatally shot Dontre Hamilton, a black man who was mentally ill.

The latest strikes forced the pediatric hospital and a neighboring facility to stop operating. \u201cNow it is being bombed. ... I am sorry. ... I have to go to transfer the children,\u201d the head of the pediatric hospital wrote in a text message to The Associated Press. The doctor identified himself only by his first name of Hatem because he fears for reprisals against his family. \n\nThe incubators already had been moved underground for safety, but with bombs falling all around the facility, hospital workers had to rush them to a safer place despite the danger. Hatem rushed 14 babies in incubators to another facility a 10-minute drive away while airstrikes continued, he said in a later message. \u201cAs we drove out with the ambulance, warplanes were firing and artillery were shelling,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut thank God we were not hurt.\u201d Some of the survivors of the suspected gas attack were taken to the children\u2019s hospital. The cameras of Al-Jazeera, which was broadcasting from the facility as the airstrikes occurred, went dark for a moment. When video resumed, dust was swirling and debris was strewn in the corridors. Nurses scurried to get babies to safety, and one was seen carrying a blanket-wrapped infant. She then hugged and comforted another nurse who was sobbing as she picked up a baby. Another hospital in a different Aleppo neighborhood was bombed Thursday night, the doctor told AP. The entrance was set on fire but no one was hurt. \n\nOnly four of seven hospitals are still operating in the district, Sahloul said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of airstrikes, artillery and barrel bombs hit 18 different neighborhoods of eastern Aleppo. Government bombings have targeted neighborhoods with medical facilities, including the children\u2019s hospital and a nearby clinic that has one of the few remaining intensive care units in eastern Aleppo, the Observatory said. Many hospitals and clinics in the besieged area have moved their operations underground after months of relentless bombardment. The World Health Organization said that in 2016, it recorded 126 attacks on health facilities, a common tactic over the five years of Syria\u2019s civil war. Russia and the Syrian government deny targeting hospitals. The city of Aleppo, once Syria\u2019s commercial hub, has been divided since 2012, with the eastern half in rebel hands and the western half controlled by government forces. Ibrahim al-Haj, a member of the Syria Civil Defense rescue unit in Aleppo, said the city \u201cis a mess.\u201d The group of rescuers and first responders said they are struggling to put out fires set off by the bombings in at least 10 areas. The Observatory said at least four people were killed in the city\u2019s districts. It also said the strike that killed the seven family members took place in southwestern Aleppo province. Syrian Civil Defense posted photos showing the bodies of children covered with dust and blood.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.94350290298462, "HarmVice": 13, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 663, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.8932023827900006, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161119050000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.07239819004525, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/claud-tex-mciver-prominent-atlanta-attorney-charged-in-wifes-shooting-death/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [167, 4568]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 707, "scraper_regex": 807}}, "headline": "Atlanta attorney charged in shooting death of business exec wife", "wordcount_as_scraped": 807, "date": "20161221220000", "story_content": "Last Updated Dec 21, 2016 6:07 PM EST\n\nATLANTA -- A well-known Atlanta attorney has been charged in the\u00a0shooting death of his business executive wife in a case that drew widespread public interest.\n\nClaud \u201cTex\u201d McIver faces a felony charge of involuntary manslaughter and a misdemeanor charge of reckless conduct and was expected to turn himself in Wednesday, Atlanta police spokesman Donald Hannah said.\n\nMcIver\u2019s attorney, Stephen Maples, did not immediately respond to a phone message and email seeking comment on the charges.\n\nMcIver has told local news media he was riding in a rear seat of an SUV on Sept. 25 when a gun he was holding discharged and the bullet hit his wife, 64-year-old Diane McIver, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. She later died at a hospital.\n\nTex McIver, who\u2019s in his 70s, is a partner at a prominent labor and employment law firm and vice chair of the state election board. He also sits on the advisory committee of the American Bar Association\u2019s Standing Committee on Gun Violence. His wife was president of U.S. Enterprises Inc., the parent company of Corey Airport Services, where she had worked for 43 years, according to the company. They lived in Atlanta\u2019s upscale Buckhead neighborhood.\n\nIn the days following the shooting, police told local news media they were working through the investigation slowly because they wanted to get it right.\n\nSeveral days after the shooting, Bill Crane, a McIver family friend, told local media that the couple was returning home from their horse ranch in rural Putnam County, about 70 miles southeast of Atlanta, when the person driving - who was later identified by media as a friend of Diane McIver - exited the highway to avoid traffic.\n\nAs the SUV near an intersection in midtown Atlanta where a homeless shelter is located, the vehicle was approached by several people. The McIvers were nervous about unrest surrounding Black Lives Matter protests and feared a carjacking, Crane told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nThe couple took out a .38-caliber snub-nose revolver wrapped in a plastic grocery bag from the center console. Several blocks later, near Piedmont Park, the SUV hit a bump and the gun fired, Crane said. Tex McIver, who was nodding off when they hit the bump, didn\u2019t remember firing the gun, Crane told the newspaper.\n\nA few days later, Maples told the Journal-Constitution that there had been no concern about unrest. Instead, he said, the McIvers pulled out the gun as a precaution after seeing people in the street in an area where homeless people hang out.\n\nMcIver fell asleep and was jarred awake near the park, Maples said.\n\n\u201cI was suddenly awoken. I lurched and the gun fired,\u201d McIver told the newspaper on Oct. 6. \u201cI must have forgotten it was in my lap. I saw a flash.\u201d\n\nTex McIver said he loved his wife and that the shooting was accidental and left him feeling overwhelmed with grief.\n\n\u201cShe was my life partner,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life as I know it is ruined because of this accident.\u201d\n\nLee Davis, an attorney for Dani Jo Carter, who was driving the SUV, told the Journal-Constitution and WSB-TV that the vehicle was stopped at a red light when the gun fired. Davis said Carter does not believe Tex McIver intentionally shot his wife.\n\nState Sen. Vincent Fort, an Atlanta Democrat, called for McIver to be removed from the state election board because of the initial account that he had been concerned about the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\u201cI believe Mr. McIver\u2019s actions since the tragic death of his wife have called into question his views on the African-American community, and undermine the presumption of fairness he must have to serve as a member of the board,\u201d Fort wrote in a letter to Senate leaders on Oct. 24, according to the Journal-Constitution.\n\nEarlier this month, Tex McIver held a four-day estate sale to unload many items from his wife\u2019s lavish closet, including designer shoes and more than 100 fur coats, according to local media. Maples said McIver is the executor of his wife\u2019s estate and the sale was a step toward settling her affairs.\n\nRoger Quillen, managing partner of Fisher & Phillips, the law firm where Tex McIver is a partner, said in a statement that McIver told the firm Monday that he will retire at the end of this year, rather than next year as planned, according to the Daily Report.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Tex McIver has been charged with a gun crime. He was indicted by a grand jury in 1990 for allegedly shooting into a car of teenagers, reported\u00a0CBS affiliate WGCL. Prosecutors declined to pursue the charges of aggravated assault, possession of a firearm and criminal damage to property.\n\nNo one was injured in that incident.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.9132719039917, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 707, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.31110955471, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.6973125884017, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fort-lauderdale-airport-gunman-esteban-santiago-traveled-to-florida-for-massacre/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1608, 2275, 2560, 3049, 4766, 5011, 5363, 5687, 5817, 5819, 5820, 6050, 6177]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 966, "scraper_regex": 1058}}, "headline": "Fort Lauderdale shooter traveled to Florida for massacre, FBI says", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1058, "date": "20170107190000", "story_content": "Last Updated Jan 7, 2017 6:48 PM EST\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- The Iraq war veteran accused of killing five travelers and wounding six others at a busy international airport in Florida appears to have traveled there specifically to carry out the attack, authorities said Saturday, but they don\u2019t know yet why he chose his target and have not yet ruled out terrorism.\n\nEsteban Santiago was federally charged on Saturday with an act of violence at an international airport resulting in death - which carries a maximum punishment of execution - and weapons charges.\n\nAccording to the charging documents, Santiago confessed to investigators that he planned the attack. He said he claimed his bag, took it to bathroom, loaded it, and put in his waistband.\n\nAuthorities said during a news conference that they had interviewed roughly 175 people, including a lengthy interrogation with the cooperative suspect, 26-year-old Santiago, a former National Guard soldier from Alaska. Flights had resumed at the Fort Lauderdale airport after the bloodshed, though the terminal where the shooting happened remained closed.\n\nFBI Agent George Piro said Santiago spoke to investigators for several hours after he opened fire with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun that he appears to have legally checked on a flight from Alaska. \u201cIndications are that he came here to carry out this horrific attack,\u201d Piro said. \u201cWe have not identified any triggers that would have caused this attack. We\u2019re pursuing all angles on what prompted him to carry out this horrific attack.\u201d\u00a0\n\nInvestigators are combing through social media and other information to determine Santiago\u2019s motive, and it\u2019s too early to say whether terrorism played a role, Piro said. In November, Santiago had walked into an FBI field office in Alaska saying the U.S. government was controlling his mind and forcing him to watch Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, videos, a U.S. law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CBS News.\n\nHe was sent to a mental health facility after police were called, the official said.\n\nPiro, who is in charge of the Miami field office, said Santiago clearly indicated at the time that he was not intent on hurting anyone.\u00a0\n\nA law enforcement source said Santiago had a handgun in his possession when he walked into the Alaska FBI office, CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton reports. It is not known if the handgun was the 9mm handgun that authorities said Santiago used in the Florida attack.\u00a0\n\nThe weapon had been taken away when he entered the FBI reception area and was held while he was interviewed by the FBI, Milton reports. When the Anchorage Police Department transported Santiago to the hospital, they took possession of the weapon. The law enforcement source said that apparently the police department returned the weapon to Santiago after he received a medical evaluation.\n\nSantiago had not been placed on the U.S. no-fly list and appears to have acted alone, Piro said.\u00a0\n\nThe attack sent panicked witnesses running out of the terminal and spilling onto the tarmac, baggage in hand. Others hid in bathroom stalls or crouched behind cars or anything else they could find as police and paramedics rushed in Friday to help the wounded and establish whether there were any other gunmen. Bruce Hugon, who had flown in from Indianapolis for a vacation, was at the baggage carousel when he heard four or five pops and saw everyone drop to the ground. He said a woman next to him tried to get up and was shot in the head. \u201cThe guy must have been standing over me at one point. I could smell the gunpowder,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I was about to feel a piercing pain or nothing at all because I would have been dead.\u201d Santiago had been discharged from the National Guard last year after being demoted for unsatisfactory performance. His brother, Bryan Santiago, said Saturday that his brother had requested psychological help but received little assistance. Esteban Santiago said in August that he was hearing voices, Bryan Santiago said in Spanish on Saturday as he stood outside his family\u2019s home. He said he told his brother then to seek help. \u201cHow is it possible that the federal government knows, they hospitalize him for only four days, and then give him his weapon back?\u201d Bryan Santiago said. His mother declined to comment as she stood inside the screen door, wiping tears from her eyes. The only thing she said was that Esteban Santiago had been tremendously affected by seeing a bomb explode next to two of his friends when he was around 18 years old while serving in Iraq.\n\nSantiago is in federal custody and will face federal charges. He is expected to appear in court Monday, Piro said.\u00a0\n\nIt is legal for airline passengers to travel with guns and ammunition as long as the firearms are put in a checked bag - not a carry-on - and are unloaded and locked in a hard-sided container. Guns must be declared to the airline at check-in.\u00a0\n\nLaw enforcement officials told CBS News\u2019 Jeff Pegues that Santiago was traveling from Alaska to Fort Lauderdale and got in an argument on one leg of the trip. Milton reported that the suspect was flying the red-eye flight out of Anchorage on Delta Air Lines and landed in Minneapolis Friday morning. He then connected to a flight to Fort Lauderdale.\u00a0\n\nHe checked only one piece of luggage: his gun, said Jesse Davis, police chief at the Anchorage airport.\n\nAt Fort Lauderdale, \u201cafter he claimed his bag, he went into the bathroom and loaded the gun and started shooting. We don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Chip LaMarca, a Broward County commissioner who was briefed by investigators.\u00a0\n\nThe gunman was taken into custody after throwing his empty weapon down and lying spread-eagle on the ground, one witness said. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe witness, Mark Lea, told CBSN \u201cpeople were yelling and screaming and frantically trying to get out of any door that they could or hide under chairs, hide behind their luggage or anything else to get out of the line of fire.\u201d\u00a0\n\nLea said the shooter was \u201ccalm as can be. He just walked in. He just started shooting. He wasn\u2019t frantic, wasn\u2019t psychotic.\u201d\u00a0\n\nLea said he was about 50 feet away from the gunman. Lea estimated that the suspect shot about 24 rounds.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.3359684944152805, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 966, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 11, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.010732283459999, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170107190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.24430641821946, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/drug-prices-to-rise-12-percent-in-2017/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [156, 582, 1049, 1182, 1711, 2453, 2821, 3626, 3884]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 696, "scraper_regex": 731}}, "headline": "Prognosis for Rx in 2017: more painful drug-price hikes", "wordcount_as_scraped": 731, "date": "20161230180000", "story_content": "If there\u2019s a remedy for rising drug costs, it\u2019s not likely to be available to many Americans in 2017.\u00a0\n\nPrescription drug costs for Americans under 65 years old are projected to jump 11.6 percent in 2017, or at a quicker pace than the 11.3 percent price increase in 2016, according to consulting firm Segal Consulting. Older Americans won\u2019t get much of a break: Their drug costs are projected to rise 9.9 percent next year, compared with 10.9 percent in 2016. By comparison, wages are expected to rise just 2.5 percent in 2017.\u00a0\n\nDrug prices continue to rise faster than either wages or the cost of living, putting a crimp in many household budgets. It\u2019s not surprising that four out of five Americans say that drug prices are unreasonable, according to a September poll from the non-partisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. The unabated price hikes may be even more discouraging to Americans because congressional investigations into drug pricing has done little to alter the pricing trend.\u00a0\n\nAmericans may have one ally on their side: President-elect Donald Trump, who said he plans to take on the pharmaceutical industry.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bring down drug prices,\u201d Trump told Time Magazine earlier this month. \u201cI don\u2019t like what\u2019s happened with drug prices.\u201d\n\nWhile the transcript of his Time interview didn\u2019t include comments on how he\u2019d accomplish that goal, he talked during his campaign about allowing Medicare to negotiate directly for prices on prescription drugs, something the federal health care plan for seniors can\u2019t currently engage in. He also said he wants to allow Americans to buy drugs from other countries, where they often cost less.\u00a0\n\nThe projections from Segal Consulting are for health plan costs, and so consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs may differ from what their plans pay. Still, those higher prices often trickle down to consumers, with Consumer Reports finding that one out of three Americans were hit with higher drug prices in the previous 12 months.\n\nIn the meantime, some lawmakers are taking aim at drug costs. U.S. Senators Susan Collins, R.-Maine, and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., are urging policy changes such as allowing temporary importation of prescription drugs when drug makers push through major price increases for off-patent drugs, as well as enacting a law that would incentivize competition in generic medications, with the goal of bringing down prices.\u00a0\n\nTheir bipartisan investigation into sudden price hikes in off-patent prescription drugs found that some pharmaceutical companies are acting more like hedge funds seeking outsized returns on investment. Some are creating monopolistic business models that allow wide-ranging pricing power, facilitating \u201castronomical price increases,\u201d their December report concluded.\u00a0\n\nIn a move that will likely renew debate over drug pricing, Biogen (BIIB) said its new Spinraza medication will carry the wholesale cost of $750,000 per patient for the first year of treatment. The medication is the first treatment for a rare and debilitating disorder called spinal muscular atrophy. That price makes it one of the most expensive medications in the world, with Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges predicting the price could be \u201cthe straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back in terms of the U.S. market\u2019s tolerance for rare disease drug pricing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Spinraza pricing decision is likely to invite a storm of criticism, up to and including Presidential tweets,\u201d Porges wrote in a research note. \u201cThe sticker-shock presented in the media could turn Spinraza into the Sovaldi of rare disease drugs.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe hepatitis C medication Sovaldi stirred up a hornet\u2019s nest of criticism when its manufacturer, Gilead, set the price at $1,000 per pill, or $84,000 per year. The cost burdened states\u2019 Medicaid spending and prompted lawsuits and threats of legal action.\u00a0\n\nRising prescription drug costs in 2017 are likely to force more Americans to make tough choices. About one in 10 American adults don\u2019t take their medications as prescribed because of the costs.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, patients are forced to go without vital medicine, and experience dangerous and sometimes life-threatening symptoms as a result,\u201d noted the Senate report on drug pricing. \u201c[Even patients] who still had insurance coverage for the medication reported watching anxiously as prices climbed, knowing they could lose access without warning if the drug were dropped from their insurance plan\u2019s formulary at any time throughout the year, or if their application for patient assistance were denied at any point.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.83727037906647, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 696, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.8624393618639999, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 2, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161230180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.14942528735632, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-donald-trumps-steve-bannon-and-steve-mnuchin-clash-over-banks/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [342, 594, 1882, 2184, 3088, 3313, 4944, 5728, 5867, 6322, 6743]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1061, "scraper_regex": 1140}}, "headline": "Will Donald Trump's two Steves clash over banks?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1140, "date": "20161206110000", "story_content": "Will the tale of two Steves end in warfare within the Trump administration over how to regulate banks? President-elect Donald Trump has tapped two men for powerful posts whose approaches to Wall Street are poles apart: populist firebrand Steve Bannon and establishment Republican Steve Mnuchin.\u00a0\n\nIn a way, the two men embody the two views of Wall Street that Mr. Trump displayed on the campaign trail -- that it\u2019s an elite cabal that has hosed the average American, and a vital business that needs to be rescued from strangling government rules.\u00a0\n\nThe firebrand, Bannon, will be Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist in the White House, an enormously powerful post. Although Bannon once worked for Goldman Sachs (GS), he since has joined the GOP\u2019s populist wing, which is suspicious of what he has called \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d He opposed the bank bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis. Bannon headed the right-wing website Breitbart News, which specializes in trashing the Republican leadership, and he has railed against the party\u2019s establishment wing as \u201cglobalists\u201d and \u201cthe party of Davos.\u201d\n\nA rumpled, unshaven fellow with a fiery temperament, Bannon, 63, endeared himself to Mr. Trump by taking over management of the campaign when it was floundering and refocusing the candidate on his all-out assault against the economic status quo.\n\nThe establishment Republican, Treasury Secretary-designate Steven Mnuchin, is also a Goldman alumnus, but he has stayed more in the storied investment firm\u2019s buttoned-down mode. At Goldman, where he was a partner, Mnuchin ran the mortgage-backed securities trading desk and served as the firm\u2019s chief information officer. He also has been a hedge fund operator and a bank CEO who aggressively foreclosed on delinquent mortgage borrowers -- making him a villain to both the populist left and right.\u00a0\n\nSoft-spoken and reserved, Mnuchin, 53, was the Trump campaign\u2019s national finance chairman and raised tens of millions in small contributions. But while a lifelong Republican, he is hardly a movement conservative, having in the past donated money to Democratic politicians, including Hillary Clinton.\u00a0\n\nOf course, every administration has factions vying to get their way on policy and win over the president. And there\u2019s no evidence to date of any conflict between the two. \u201cThey have always worked well together and are totally in sync with President-elect Trump,\u201d spokeswoman Hope Hicks wrote in an email reply to questions about how Bannon and Mnuchin would interact.\n\nNevertheless,  their pronounced differences have led to rampant speculation that they will end up tussling over policy. The stakes are high enough that the subject bears scrutiny.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s populism versus Goldman Sachs,\u201d said Mike Mayo, banking analyst at international investment firm CLSA. \u201cLooks like there will be some mud-wrestling in the process.\u201d\n\nTo Paul Brace, a Rice University political science professor who has studied the presidency, \u201dBannon is genetically programmed to be a bomb thrower, and this could upset Mnuchin.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn a research note, Cowen & Co. analyst Jaret Seiberg pointed out that Mnuchin probably will have his hands full on Capitol Hill revamping the tax code, with the result that \u201cBannon may play a bigger role on bank policy.\u201d \u00a0\n\nWhose views are more likely to prevail on the banks question? Economist Hugh Johnson, who runs an asset management firm in Albany, New York, opts for Mnuchin. \u201cOver time, I think Trump will learn to appreciate the more thoughtful and balanced approach\u201d of Mnuchin, he said. \u201cTrump cannot be a flamethrower and be successful, so my guess is that Bannon will become less important over time.\u201d\n\nThe two incoming Trump officials have widely contrasting upbringings. Although both are wealthy, Bannon came from a blue-collar background and is self-made -- his father was a telephone lineman. Mnuchin\u2019s father, Robert, was a Goldman lifer, and young Steve had a privileged upbringing. He drove a Porsche while a Yale undergrad.\n\nBannon served as a Navy officer, and his daughter went to West Point. He has expressed resentment at how few well-off types join the armed forces. Mnuchin, like many from his social stratum, didn\u2019t serve in the military. Bannon worked at Goldman for only four years, while Mnuchin did for 17.\n\nAt this early stage, before Mr. Trump takes office, the public has seen only glimpses of Bannon\u2019s and Mnuchin\u2019s thoughts about what specifically they think needs to be done to reform Wall Street. While Bannon\u2019s job isn\u2019t subject to Senate approval, Mnuchin\u2019s is, meaning he must testify before the Senate Banking Committee. That should shed more light on his intentions.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law likely will be at the heart of their differences. Enacted in 2010, the measure requires banks to maintain sufficient capital to offset losses and curbs riskier trading using an institution\u2019s own funds.\u00a0\n\nThe law also set up the Consumer Financial Protection Board, which has cracked down on, among other things, what it sees as abusive lending and credit card schemes. Conservatives and the banking industry in general want to rein in the CFPB.\n\nIn recent TV interviews, Mnuchin has said he wants to pare back Dodd-Frank\u2019s regulatory burden, especially on smaller banks, in a bid to encourage lending to businesses and consumers. He has indicated that the law\u2019s rules were often \u201ctoo complicated.\u201d Note that he did not call for gutting Dodd-Frank.\n\nBannon hasn\u2019t expressed his views on public issues lately, but in the past has been very vocal about Wall Street. At a conference held at the Vatican in 2014, Bannon railed against bailouts of banks during the 2008-09 financial crisis. \u00a0According to a transcript of his remarks, he denigrated \u201cthe Republican establishment, which is really a collection of crony capitalists.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHe lamented that \u201cno criminal charges\u201d were brought against bank executives. And he warned: \u201cTrust me -- they are going to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nExactly what that might mean for bank rules is hard to tell. Bannon called for a restoration of something close to the Glass-Steagall Act, passed in the Great Depression and repealed in 1999. That law separated banks\u2019 lending and investment operations, which Dodd-Frank mandates to a less-stringent degree.\u00a0\n\nCertainly, other actors are involved in this drama. Since the election, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, a former member of the House of Representatives, has been in close contact with congressional leaders to plot legislative strategy. Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has his own ideas on rolling back Dodd-Frank, and his panel has approved his version.\u00a0\n\nUltimately, the White House\u2019s policy will be shaped by Mr. Trump, who has indicated he wants to be a hands-on president who\u2019ll negotiate with Capitol Hill, said economist Gary Shilling, who runs an investment firm in Springfield, New Jersey. Added Shilling: \u201cWhat you\u2019ll hear from the two Steves will largely be a reflection of what Trump thinks.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.46299481391907, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1061, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.7768323777900004, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161206110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.16776625824694, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hero-dogs-nonprofit-helps-military-veterans-disability/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1214, 1960, 2138, 3530]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 582, "scraper_regex": 679}}, "headline": "\"Hero dogs\" offer help to America's heroes", "wordcount_as_scraped": 679, "date": "20161212160000", "story_content": "Of nearly 19 million American military veterans, about one quarter of them live with a disability.

But Donald Trump, as a candidate, showed his contempt for the Federal Reserve and its leader, Janet Yellen. Now, Yellen is fighting back, if ever so subtly.\n\nAt a rally in September, Mr. Trump accused Yellen of doing President Barack Obama\u2019s bidding by keeping interest rates artificially low, to prevent the economy from looking bad. \u201cShe should be ashamed of herself,\u201d he said,\u00a0 \u201cWhat they are doing is, I believe, it\u2019s a false market,\u201d referring to the central bank. He pledged not to reappoint her to a second four-year term once her current tenure ends in January 2018.\n\nBack then, she confined her response to a polite denial that Fed policy was set with elections in mind. \u00a0\u201cI can say, emphatically, that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy,\u201d she said during a press conference following the Fed\u2019s policy meeting that month. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut in her news conference Wednesday, following the\u00a0Fed\u2019s decision to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter-percentage point, \u00a0Fed Chair Yellen stepped up her response, albeit in a measured way. She displayed defiance toward President-elect Trump and some of his policies, and offered a defense of the Fed\u2019s independence.\u00a0\n\nSome speculate that, now that he has actually won the presidency, Mr. Trump has mellowed toward Yellen and the Fed, as he seems to have done\u00a0on some other issues. Since the election, he has remained silent about the central bank and its chief. A query to the Trump transition team about his latest thinking on the Fed went unreturned. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nReporters repeatedly tried Wednesday to entice her into criticizing Mr. Trump. At first blush, she appeared to deflect the questions diplomatically. For instance, asked about his tweets slamming companies, like Boeing (BA), she replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to give the incoming president advice about how to conduct himself in policy.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, piece by piece, at her news conference, she took on Mr. Trump in several key areas:\u00a0\n\nFed independence. Yellen pointed out that the Fed is meant to function apart from both Congress and the executive branch, to insulate it from political influence in its monetary decisions. \u201cShe\u2019ll fight fiercely for that,\u201d said Chris \u00a0Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Wealth. There\u2019s a movement in Congress among the more conservative Republicans to scrutinize the central bank\u2019s deliberations more thoroughly, often dubbed \u201cauditing the Fed,\u201d which some feel is a first step to undermining its independent nature.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a strong believer in the independence of the Fed,\u201d Yellen said Wednesday. \u201cWe have been given the independence by Congress to make decisions about monetary policy in pursuit of our dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and [minimum] inflation. That\u2019s what I intend to stay focused on, that\u2019s what the committee is focused on.\u201d\n\nHer continuity. After Mr. Trump said during the campaign that he wouldn\u2019t keep her on for another term, speculation arose that he would force her out before the end of her tenure, even though he has no authority to remove her. FBR Capital Markets analyst Edward Mills declared: \u201cThe future of Janet Yellen\u2019s chairmanship and the accommodative nature of Fed monetary policy are in doubt.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhile Yellen previously said she would serve out her time as chair, on Wednesday she responded with a tiny bit more lecture-like\u00a0 bite: \u201cI guess the way I think about it is that I was confirmed by the Senate to a four-year term. The term of the Fed chair was not meant to coincide with the president ... I do intend to serve out my four-year term.\u201d \u00a0\n\nShe went on to say: \u201cI haven\u2019t made any decision about the future. I recognize I might or might not be reappointed.\u201d \u00a0But then she noted that her term as a Fed governor -- one of seven whom she presides over as chair -- lasts until 2024, meaning she might stick around in one form or another.\n\nDodd-Frank banking reforms. Mr. Trump has said he wants to dismantle much of the Dodd-Frank law that imposes a heavier regulatory hand on banks. While acknowledging that some of the measure\u2019s requirements have gone too far, Yellen said that it was \u201cimportant\u201d to maintain key provisions. Namely, higher capital-reserve levels at banks, to buffer them in bad times, and \u201cliving wills\u201d on lenders, which lay out the procedures for a troubled institution to close without a federal bailout.\n\nFiscal stimulus. Yellen has long complained that the burden of trying to right the economy after the financial crisis was mostly on the Fed\u2019s shoulders, with little help from sustained government spending in such areas as infrastructure. The absence of a fiscal component in economic stimulus for much of the past eight years was due to a rift between the GOP-controlled Congress and the Obama administration. Now that Mr. Trump is calling for heavier federal outlays to boost the economy, she said it really is no longer necessary: \u201cSo I would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment.\u201d\n\nGDP growth. Mr. Trump wants to double the tepid GDP growth rate to around 4 percent. Yellen\u2019s Fed evidently doesn\u2019t think that is do-able. It projects economic growth of 2.1 percent next year, 2.0 percent in 2018 and 1.9 percent in 2019. And she warned about taking on more federal debt, which Mr. Trump apparently would have to do to meet his spending and tax-cut goals.\u00a0\n\nAlways casting herself as making decisions that are \u201cdata dependent,\u201d Yellen said she needed to know more about the details of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan before knowing how the Fed would respond. On the evidence thus far, she appears to dislike what she sees.

Atheist Preston Smith\u2019s 10-foot tall sculpture lay broken in Sanborn Square at noon. Tire tracks led from the twisted metal to the street. It appeared vandals had attached a chain from a vehicle to the sculpture and yanked it down, dragging it several feet. As local television reporters prepared live broadcasts, two passersby stopped and pushed the sculpture back onto its base before walking away. The sculpture sits about 20 feet from a traditional Nativity scene of Mary, Joseph and the baby Jesus, and is backed by a banner from an atheist group reading \u201cKeep Saturn in Saturnalias,\u201d a reference to the belief that the early Christian church substituted Christmas for a Roman pagan holiday. It is the latest Florida protest against manger scenes on public property, mirroring earlier battles inside the state capitol in Tallahassee. Boca Raton police officer Sandra Boonenberg said the overnight strike was the third attack on Smith\u2019s sculpture and its explanatory banner since he erected the display earlier this month. Someone painted the once-red sculpture black on Monday. Earlier, someone damaged the banner.  Detectives are investigating. Smith, a middle school English teacher, said that as an atheist, he does not believe in God nor Satan, but is using a symbol often associated with devil worship to highlight his belief that religious displays have no place on public property, because they make non-believers \u201cfeel like second-class citizens.\u201d \u201cWe are here to call out Christian hypocrisy and theistic bias in taxpayer-funded public arenas while advocating for the separation of church and state,\u201d he told The Associated Press Monday night, before the latest act of vandalism. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to return the government to its viewpoint neutral stance so that when an atheist takes a stroll through the park we aren\u2019t assaulted by Bronze Age mythology.\u201d He could not be immediately reached Tuesday, but called the earlier acts of vandalism \u201cexamples of mob mentality toward minority faiths.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that government agencies can allow religious displays on public property, but if they do, they cannot discriminate. Both the Nativity scene and the Pentagram were installed with city permits. A group of local religious leaders -- 14 ministers, two rabbis and the president of the local mosque -- placed a banner next to Smith\u2019s sculpture criticizing its placement. \u201cThe use of satanic symbols is offensive and harmful to our community\u2019s well-being,\u201d the banner reads. \u201cWe find it a shameful and hypocritical way to advocate for freedom from religion.\u201d The city issued a statement saying that while it respects Smith\u2019s free-speech rights, it doesn\u2019t support his message. \u201cIn years past, the seasonal, religious displays in Sanborn Square have contained messages projecting the themes of peace, forgiveness and harmony,\u201d it said. \u201cThis display appears to be more about shock value, attention and challenging our commitment to constitutionally protected free speech rather than promoting goodwill, respect and tolerance during the holiday season.\u201d Passerby Judy Hill, a retired information technology worker, decried the vandalism but didn\u2019t think Smith should have erected his sculpture next to the Nativity scene. \u201cI know there is freedom of speech, but there is a time and place for everything,\u201d said Hill, a Methodist. \u201cHe just wanted to get publicity and he got it.\u201d\u00a0\n\nTina Yeager agreed.\n\n\u201cIt is a very precious season and for someone to come and almost make fun of that, to just really negate the time of year, it\u2019s inappropriate,\u201d she told CBS Miami.\u00a0\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, atheists erected protest displays in the Florida capitol after a Christian group placed a manger there.

You know, it makes you wonder what would make indiduals treat somebody like that.\u201d\n\nThe victim, who has mental health challenges, was a high-risk missing person from northwest suburban Crystal Lake. The victim was a classmate of one of the attackers and initially went with that person voluntarily, Cmdr. Kevin Duffin said. CBS Chicago reports the suspects are believed to have stolen a van and taken the victim from the suburbs into Chicago.\n\nGuglielmi says it\u2019s possible the suspects were trying to extort something from the victim\u2019s family. \u00a0The victim\u2019s family reveived text messages from the suspects during the kidnapping, reports CBS Chicago. Eventually, the victim was untied and released.\n\nInvestigators said the victim was with his attackers for up to 48 hours, and the attack left him traumatized.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s traumatized by the incident and it\u2019s very tough to communicate with him at this point,\u201d Duffin said.\u00a0\n\nChicago police said in a statement that while on patrol, they saw the disoriented male walking outside. He was then transported to an area hospital for treatment. \u00a0\n\nAt about the same time, police took several people into custody at a nearby address where they found signs of a struggle and property damage. Investigators determined that the missing man had been at the same address.\n\nWhen asked Wednesday about the racial comments on the video, Duffin said the four people in custody were \u201cyoung adults and they make stupid decisions.\u201d Investigators will have to determine whether the racial remarks were \u201csincere or just stupid ranting and raving\u201d when considering a potential hate crime charge, Duffin said.\n\nPolice haven\u2019t identified the individuals in custody, but said three are Chicago residents and one is from suburban Carpentersville. Guglielmi said the suspects are all age 18 or older, and that police were working with prosecutors on Thursday \u201cto build the strongest case.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -10.7011070251465, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 519, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 5, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.73600591914, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.39499036608863, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/europe-2017-brexit-far-right-surging-russian-threat/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [252, 288, 1202, 2764, 3480, 4784]}}, "headline": "Why Europe's leaders don't expect a smooth ride in 2017", "wordcount_as_scraped": 951, "date": "20161230190000", "story_content": "LONDON -- Europe\u2019s leaders are not expecting a smooth ride in 2017 following a year marked by political upheaval, extremist attacks, unchecked immigration, and a rising military threat from Russia.\u00a0\n\nBritain is suing for divorce, the\u00a0far-right is on the march, some former Soviet satellites seem disillusioned with the West even as Russia seeks to regain its influence, and America will soon inaugurate an untested, seemingly Russia-friendly president who has voiced doubts about the usefulness of the NATO alliance. The uncertainty is thick enough to breathe. It all looks so different from the triumphant panorama presented more than two decades ago when the European Union was expanding. Formerly captive nations freed from Soviet control seemed eager to embrace liberal democracy, capitalism - and substantial subsidies - from their wealthier neighbors. There was rosy talk of an ever-closer union, the development of a single currency, and a cooperative relationship with Russia. It hasn\u2019t turned out that way - the EU, with its touted ideals of shared democratic values and free movement of people, has never seemed so frayed and vulnerable.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe risks for 2017 remain very high,\u201d said Adam Thomson, director of the London-based European Leadership Network research group. \u201cWe Europeans need to recognize that we face a level of risk in the West-Russian confrontation that we have not seen since the 1960s. It is partly because a lot of the security rules of the road have been torn up or suspended, so there are fewer rules and less predictability.\u201d He said most Europeans do not perceive the danger because they have been lulled by the cordial East-West relations that prevailed for years after the Soviet collapse in 1991. \u201cEuropeans have gotten used to 25 years of peace dividend, and a stability they have come to think of as normal but in fact might be the abnormality in Europe\u2019s long history of conflict,\u201d Thomson said. There is deep unease in the Baltics, Scandinavia and elsewhere as Russia moves more military forces to its border regions and even places nuclear capable Iskander ballistic missiles into the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, where they can threaten part of Poland, Germany, and other countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin seems emboldened by the lukewarm international response to his government\u2019s annexation of the Crimea two years ago and his strong intervention in Syria this year - and by the growing support he enjoys among far-right political leaders who are gaining ground in Europe. He has already been making inroads, with a pro-Russia candidate elected president in Moldova and a candidate calling for a European rapprochement with Russia winning in Bulgaria.\u00a0\n\nElectoral focal points in the coming year are France, where voters may bring to power a far-right National Front government that wants to follow Britain out of the European Union, and Germany and the Netherlands, where far-right parties also stand to make gains. The increasing appeal of the far-right has been fueled by public unhappiness with the ongoing influx of migrants, mostly from the Middle East and Africa. Events like the recent extremist attack that killed 12 people at a Christmas market in Berlin - combined with earlier assaults on civilians in Paris and Brussels - have made it more common for Europeans to view the incoming human tide as a potential threat. The coming year will determine whether\u00a0Britain\u2019s surprise decision in a June referendum to walk away from the many benefits of EU membership in favor of establishing firm border controls was an anomaly or a harbinger of things to come. Elections in the Netherlands in March are expected to bring strong gains for Geert Wilders\u2019 anti-Islam, anti-EU Party for Freedom, which could emerge as the biggest party. Even if that happens, he will likely find it very difficult to find enough partners to form a majority government in a country where coalitions are the norm due to the voting system and proliferation of smaller parties. Wilders\u2019 outspoken opposition to Islam has gained traction in a nation long known for its tolerance. He wants the Netherlands, a founding member of the EU, to leave the 28-nation bloc. The first round of French voting in April is expected to bring far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen into the final round against conservative Francois Fillon. Both pose a threat to the European status quo: Le Pen wants to take France out of the EU, end its use of the shared euro currency, and close the border-free zone. Both candidates favor closer ties to Russia, including a lifting of sanctions. Both want to reduce immigration and strengthen border controls, though Fillon prefers to do so from within the EU bloc.\u00a0\n\nGerman elections expected in September are likely to bring the nationalist Alternative for Germany party into the federal parliament for the first time. The party\u2019s strength, stemming from dissatisfaction at the influx of migrants to Germany over the past two years, has put Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s center-right Christian Democrats on the defensive - particularly after the Christmas market truck attack, apparently carried out by an asylum-seeker from Tunisia. Some experts believe a Le Pen triumph in the final round in France in May would deal a fatal blow to the EU. \u201cFrance is the critical one,\u201d said Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe research group. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll win, but if she does I think it would probably mean the end of the EU because she would start to challenge the authority of EU law,\u201d he said. \u201cShe would ignore laws she doesn\u2019t like, unilaterally start to impose border checks, and the sheer fragility of the EU would be brought into sharp relief. People don\u2019t understand how fragile it is.\u201d ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.93679916858673, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 916, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.6792920626999996, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161230190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.49344978165939, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nationwide-protests-against-dakota-oil-pipeline-as-builder-seeks-key-ok/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Nationwide protests against Dakota oil pipeline as builder seeks key OK", "wordcount_as_scraped": 744, "date": "20161116100000", "story_content": "CANNON BALL, N.D. -- The company building the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline has asked a federal judge\u2019s permission to circumvent the Obama administration and move ahead with a disputed section of the project in North Dakota. This, as opponents held protests across the country against the pipeline.\n\nDallas-based Energy Transfer Partners and a subsidiary asked the court Tuesday to let them lay pipe under a Missouri River reservoir, a plan the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says threatens its drinking water and cultural sites. The Army Corps of Engineers said Monday it needs more time to study the impact of the plan.\n\nWhile President-elect Trump, a pipeline supporter, likely would greenlight the project when he takes office in January, the company is trying to win federal approval -- or a court order -- to allow it to go forward sooner. The delay has already cost nearly $100 million, the company said in court documents, \u201cand further delay in the consideration of this case would add millions of dollars more each month in costs which cannot be recovered.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the company blamed the Obama administration for \u201cpolitical interference\u201d in the pipeline review process.\n\nThe Army Corps referred a request for comment to the Justice Department, which declined comment.\n\nProtests were being held Tuesday across the country, from California to Vermont. Activists called for demonstrations at Army Corps of Engineers offices and at banks financing the pipeline construction.\n\nMore than two dozen people were arrested near Mandan, North Dakota, after a group of about 400 protesters put a truck and tree branches on BNSF Railway tracks near a pipeline work staging area and tried to set it on fire, Morton County sheriff\u2019s spokesman Rob Keller said.\n\n\u201cThey had a rope soaked with kerosene,\u201d he said. \u201cA (Highway Patrol) trooper with an extinguisher doused it so it wouldn\u2019t light.\u201d\n\nTrains were delayed three hours, railroad spokeswoman Amy McBeth said. Officers in riot gear used pepper spray and in one instance a stun gun against protesters who refused to leave.\n\nMandan is about 50 miles north of a camp where hundreds of protesters have gathered in recent months to oppose the pipeline. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental attorney and president of the New York-based Waterkeeper Alliance, which seeks to protect watersheds worldwide, visited the camp Tuesday, speaking out against the arrests of protesters and a project he says will benefit billionaires and not the American people.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing here is a crime, an environmental crime, and there are real victims,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Columbus, Ohio, police reported an activist blocked traffic by handcuffing himself under a vehicle at a downtown intersection. In Montpelier, Vermont, more than 100 people gathered outside a bank, chanting, singing songs and holding signs saying \u201cWater is Life\u201d and \u201cStanding With Standing Rock.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may seem hopeless, like David against Goliath, but we believe that if we\u2019re persistent and we recruit, that this movement will grow and hopefully these kinds of projects will stop,\u201d said protester Lee Shen of Thetford Center, Vermont.\n\nThe Corps on Monday called for more study and input from the Standing Rock Sioux before it decides whether to allow the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe. The 1,200-mile pipeline that\u2019s to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois is largely complete except for that stretch, which will skirt the tribe\u2019s reservation.\n\nGov. Jack Dalrymple said Tuesday that an additional delay \u201cdoes nothing but prolong and intensify the public safety issues imposed on Morton County and the state of North Dakota since the beginning of August,\u201d when protests against the pipeline broke out. In his statement, Dalrymple said a decision on the project easement \u201cis long overdue\u201d and that the pipeline would be safe.\n\nThe Corps in July granted Energy Transfer Partners the permits needed for the project, but it said in September that further analysis was warranted, given the tribe\u2019s concerns. Its announcement Monday came amid speculation that federal officials were on the brink of approving the crossing. ETP last week began preparing equipment to bore under the river.\n\nETP disputes that the pipeline would endanger the tribe, and CEO Kelcy Warren noted earlier that Army Assistant Secretary Jo-Ellen Darcy had informed company officials and Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault that the Corps\u2019 previous permit decisions \u201ccomported with legal requirements.\u201d ETP contends that the Corps has no legal justification for the delay.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.9267015457153303, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 710, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.9005556606400003, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161116100000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.66197183098592, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamacare-repeal-warning-massive-job-losses/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [309, 620, 1880, 2243, 2478, 3115, 3479]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 599, "scraper_regex": 653}}, "headline": "Obamacare repeal warning: \"massive job losses\"", "wordcount_as_scraped": 653, "date": "20170106200000", "story_content": "Americans may be split on their feelings about the Affordable Care Act, with some citing concerns about the law\u2019s expense. But a new study finds that getting rid of Obamacare could lead to even higher costs, including the loss of 3 million jobs within four years.\u00a0\n\nThe Republicans are gearing up to repeal the law this month, even though they don\u2019t yet have a replacement plan. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) told CBSN earlier this month that the GOP would focus on the best-known and unpopular parts of the law, such as the penalties and mandates for individual coverage.\u00a0\n\nIf the ACA\u2019s tax credits and Medicaid expansion are repealed without a replacement plan, the hospitals and health care providers would see their uncompensated medical care costs surge by $1.1 trillion from 2019 to 2028, while the country would suffer \u201cmuch broader economic repercussions,\u201d according to the new report from the Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University and the Commonwealth Fund.\n\n\u201cRepealing key parts of the ACA could trigger massive job losses and a slump in consumer and business spending that would affect all sectors of state economies,\u201d said lead author Leighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research and professor of health policy and management at the Milken Institute, in a statement. \u201cCuts in federal funding would not only harm the health care industry and its employees but could lead to serious economic distress for states, including a $1.5 trillion reduction in gross state product from 2019 to 2023.\u201d\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Thursday tweeted that the GOP has plans to come up with something \u201cFAR BETTER\u201d than the current health care law, although it\u2019s unclear what that might be. Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t proposed or endorsed an alternative plan to replace the current law.\u00a0\n\nAmong the economic impact of a repeal would be widespread job losses, the report projected. The economy would shed 2.6 million jobs in 2019, rising to almost 3 million by 2021, the research found. Only a third of those job losses will come from the health care sector, with the majority stemming from industries as wide-ranging as construction and real estate.\u00a0\n\nThe job losses will spiral beyond the health care sector because of the indirect impact of federal funding, which could hinder some workers from using their incomes to pay for food, mortgages and other necessities, the report noted.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFederal funding thus initiates an economic cycle that ripples throughout the economy, both within and across state borders,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe gains from this cycle also generate additional state and local tax revenues. When federal funds are cut, the results play out in the other direction, triggering losses in employment, economic activity, and state and local revenues.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the impact of an Obamacare repeal may not be as dire as projected by the Commonwealth Fund. For instance, changes to tax policy or other health care policy tweaks could abate the impact of eliminating the tax credits and Medicaid expansion.\u00a0\n\nThe study\u2019s forecast of the repeal\u2019s impact on individual states found that the biggest hits will be felt by California, which would lose 334,000 jobs, and Florida, with job losses of 181,000. State treasuries would also be at risk because of shrinking tax revenue, with the study projecting a loss of $48 billion in state and local tax revenue over five years.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe immediate and most visible effect of ACA repeal would be the loss of coverage and access to care for millions of people who have gained insurance because of the law,\u201d said Sara Collins, vice president for health care coverage and access at the Commonwealth Fund, said in a statement. \u201cThis study points to even larger potential economic effects that would be detrimental to the health and well-being of millions more.\u201d\n\nBelow are the 10 states projected to suffer the largest job losses:", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.6199095249176003, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 599, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.1465578727, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170106200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.83973288814691, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/doris-payne-cops-notorious-86-year-old-jewel-thief-career-criminal-strikes-again/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [83, 268, 487, 672, 796, 1098, 1448, 2104, 2197, 2485, 2804, 3103]}}, "headline": "Cops: Notorious 86-year-old jewel thief, \"career criminal,\" strikes again", "wordcount_as_scraped": 589, "date": "20161215010000", "story_content": "ATLANTA --\u00a0An 86-year-old jewel thief who has kept jewelry sellers on their toes since the 1970s has struck again, police say - this time by slipping two $2,000 diamond necklaces into her pocket.\u00a0Doris Payne, who has been the subject of a documentary and casually said during an Associated Press interview earlier this year that \u201cI was a thief,\u201d was arrested Tuesday at a Von Maur department store outside Atlanta.\u00a0Payne was arrested after she put the necklaces in her back pocket and tried to leave the store, Dunwoody police spokesman Mark Stevens said in an email. She faces a shoplifting charge.\u00a0Online jail records did not show any bond information, and it wasn\u2019t clear whether Payne had an attorney who could comment.\u00a0Attorney Shawn McCullers, who represented her last year when she was accused of pocketing a $690 pair of earrings from a Saks Fifth Avenue department store at a mall in Atlanta\u2019s upscale Buckhead neighborhood, said in an email Wednesday that he was not currently representing her in the latest arrest.\u00a0\n\nAuthorities have said Payne has lifted pricey baubles from countless jewelry stores around the world in an illicit career that has spanned six decades. The legend of Payne\u2019s alleged thefts have long fascinated the public and media, with countless news stories and a 2013 documentary film, \u201cThe Life and Crimes of Doris Payne,\u201d detailing her feats.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a day that I went to steal that I did not get what I went to do,\u201d Payne says in the documentary.When asked about her exploits in the interview with The Associated Press earlier this year, she said simply: \u201cI was a thief.\u201d Speaking to CBS affiliate WGCL after a theft arrest in Atlanta last year, Payne said she freely admits to her crime if she\u2019s caught.\n\n\u201cAs any officer \u2013 have I ever been arrested and lied?\u201d Payne told the station.Atlanta police have called her a career criminal, the station reports. Court papers in Atlanta reference six cases prior to the alleged theft last year, mostly in southern California, dating to 1999.\u00a0Payne was raised in West Virginia and moved with her family to Ohio when she was a teenager.\u00a0Authorities have said she has used at least 22 aliases over the years and probably got away more often than she was caught, though she has done several stints in prison. The Jewelers\u2019 Security Alliance, an industry trade group, sent out bulletins as early as the 1970s warning about her.\u00a0Payne told the AP she realized a simple distraction could make it easy to slip out with a fancy trinket in hand after a friendly store owner let her try on watches as a child and then forgot she had the jewelry on.

Tracy Smith has our Sunday Profile:\n\nAdam Driver was the brain-probing bad guy in last year\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d mega-hit, \u201cThe Force Awakens.\u201d\n\nHe was intense and malevolent, sure. But his Kylo Ren was also kind of, well, vulnerable.\n\nClearly, Driver is no \u201cStar Wars\u201d villain, but he might be just as complex.\n\nBefore he ever picked up a lightsaber, Driver was best known as Lena Dunham\u2019s boyfriend in the hit HBO series, \u201cGirls.\u201d The role seems tailor-made:\u00a0 He plays an actor named Adam, who lives in Brooklyn.\n\nDunham: \u201cYou\u2019re not being that nice to me. I don\u2019t really understand why you want to have me around.\u201dDriver: \u201cWhen you love someone, you don\u2019t have to be nice all the time.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBut his latest film is a bit more of a stretch. In Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cPaterson,\u201d Driver is a bus driver who really wants to a port. It\u2019s not your typical Hollywood movie, and isn\u2019t meant to be.\n\nWas Driver worried about doing a movie about poetry?\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s kind of a joke that we talked about on set -- that, you know, \u2018Dozens of people are gonna watch this movie, so we really gotta make it good! Like, a bus-driving poet, that\u2019s gonna be really action-packed! They\u2019re gonna be lining up to see this!\u2019\u201d\n\nSo far at least, critics have been lining up to praise it.\n\nThe film does have a few surprise turns -- and that\u2019s pretty much the story of Adam Driver\u2019s life.\n\nRaised in a middle-class home in Mishawaka, Indiana, he was a slacker student who liked drama and not much else.\n\n\u201cI auditioned for Juilliard when I was a senior in high school,\u201d Driver said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get in. So, I\u2019m like, \u2018Okay, then I just won\u2019t go to college.\u2019 I didn\u2019t apply to anywhere else. That was my genius plan! And if didn\u2019t get into that school, which I heard was, like, a good school to go to for acting, then I just won\u2019t do it, you know?\u201d\n\nAfter Juilliard turned him down, he lived at home, sold vacuum cleaners, and pondered his future.\n\nIt all came to him in a flash in 2001, on September 11th. \u201cI feel like probably most people in the country did at the time, just shock and horror and anger. And wanted, like, retribution and to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m at the age where I can. Nothing is holding me back here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas that actually the cognition, that, \u2018Hey, I can help out here\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it was part of it. And joining the military seemed like a good idea.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSo Adam Driver enlisted In the Marines.\n\n\u201cWas there a moment where you thought, \u2018What did I do?\u2019\u201d Smith asked. \n\n\u201cYeah!\u00a0 These huge dudes, also with shaved heads, are yelling at you. These grown men, you know. And you\u2019re just, you\u2019re alone I guess, essentially.\u201d\n\nBut after a few weeks, he learned to love it. He became a rifleman, highly-trained in ground combat and small arms. But just before he was to ship out for Iraq, he broke his sternum in a biking accident, and was medically discharged from the Corps.\n\nHeartbroken and unemployed, Driver re-applied to Juilliard. This time, he got in -- and had to learn to be a civilian all over again.\n\n\u201cNot that I was spitting on the ground or dragging my knuckles, but like, you know, just used to being very direct,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo you had to tone yourself down a little bit? For the sensitive actors?\u201d\n\n\u201cTone it down, yeah, well, maybe. Yeah. I mean, which is all probably hiding some kind of insecurity in myself, you know? \u2018Is Adam crying in the corner again?\u2019 I mean, I didn\u2019t cry. Crying is for weak people. No!\u201d\n\nKidding aside, Driver found that theatre helped him cope, and figured it could also help his brothers and sisters in arms. So he co-founded Arts in the Armed Forces. The group puts on bare-bones theatre productions for service men and women.\n\nWhen asked if he formed the arts group because he felt a kind of \u201csurvivor\u2019s guilt,\u201d for not going overseas with his fellow Marines, Driver said, \u201cI think there was initially, maybe a high level of guilt that I didn\u2019t get to complete my service. I didn\u2019t get to go overseas and do the job I trained to do with the guys that I trained to do it with.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo what better audience than the people that are protecting our country? Acting is a service industry? Why not service the ultimate service industry, which is being in the military?\u201d\n\nOnce out of school, his acting career took off, with parts in ever-bigger productions, including Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cLincoln,\u201d the Coen Brothers\u2019 \u201cInside Llewyn Davis,\u201d and Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cFrances Ha.\u201d \n\nAnd not long after he was cast in the mother of all franchise films.\n\nSmith asked, \u201cSo when you found out you were going to be the bad guy, what did you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way better. Costumes are better. Lightsabers are better.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one person who can disarm Adam Driver: his non-profit co-founder, Joanne Tucker, whom he married in 2013. They\u2019ve booked military gigs well into the New Year.\n\nIn the meantime, you can see him in another role he really hungered for. In the new Martin Scorsese film \u201cSilence,\u201d Driver is a Jesuit priest who, with Andrew Garfield, is on a dangerous mission to find a lost colleague in 17th century Japan.\n\nDriver physically transformed himself for the role, losing 51 pounds. \n\n\u201cThat was important to me, to get down as much as we could in the time we had to hopefully tell that story.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then after you told that story did you -- \u201c\n\n\u201cAte a lotta food, yeah!\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not exactly a starving actor anymore: Life on his home turf in Brooklyn is pretty good. And he\u2019ll return to the Dark Side for \u201cStar Wars: Episode VIII\u201d next year.\n\nAnd after that? Like every good Marine, Adam Driver knows to be ready for anything.\n\nSmith asked, \u201cWere you worried when you found out that you\u2019d be the guy who would kill Han Solo?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat took a lot of -- I had to think about it for a while. And I also have an allergy to, like, big blockbuster Hollywood movies.\n\n\u201cThere is no guidebook to how you\u2019re supposed to be in your career, the projects that you\u2019re supposed to pick. It\u2019s just follow the things that are personal and interesting to you, and apart from that, everything will fall into place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0For more info: ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.14035081863403, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1006, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 7, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.82842712475, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161225150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.18687872763419, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-foreign-leaders-are-reacting-to-trumps-travel-ban/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1094]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 589, "scraper_regex": 686}}, "headline": "How foreign leaders are reacting to Trump's travel ban", "wordcount_as_scraped": 686, "date": "20170129000000", "story_content": "Last Updated Jan 28, 2017 8:51 PM EST\n\nAfter President Trump signed an executive order pausing travel to the U.S. for refugees and citizens of seven majority Muslim countries, world leaders are pushing back on the White House directives, with at least one affected nation suggesting it could even retaliate with its own ban on Americans. \n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani criticized Mr. Trump Saturday after the executive orders started taking effect, saying that it was \u201cnot the time to build walls between nations.\u201d \n\n\u201cThey have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed many years ago,\u201d Rouhani said in a speech carried live on Iranian state television. \u201cEven if there are walls between nations, they must be removed.\u201d \n\nJavad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, had harsher words for what he termed on Twitter a \u201c#Muslimban.\u201d \n\nHe charged that Mr. Trump\u2019s actions would be considered by history as a \u201cgreat gift to extremists and their supporters\u201d and said it showed the \u201cbaselessness of U.S. claims of friendship with the Iranian people.\u201d \u00a0\n\n#MuslimBan will be recorded in history as a great gift to extremists and their supporters.1/7\u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) January 28, 2017\n\nCollective discrimination aids terrorist recruitment by deepening fault-lines exploited by extremist demagogues to swell their ranks. 2/7\u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) January 28, 2017\n\n#MuslimBan shows baselessness of U.S. claims of friendship with the Iranian people while only having issues with the Government. 4/7\u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) January 28, 2017\n\nIn a statement, Iran\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the ban a \u201cblatant insult\u201d to Muslims and Iranians and seemed to threaten its own retaliatory measures against the U.S. \n\nIran, the statement read, \u201cwill engage in a careful assessment of the short and medium-term impact of the decision of the U.S. Government on Iranian nationals\u201d and \u201cwill take reciprocal measures in order to safeguard the rights of its citizens.\u201d\n\nAlso, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Douglas Silliman, has warned the Trump administration to expect major fallout from Iraq after his executive order, according to one U.S. official.\n\nSpecifically, according to the official, Silliman cautioned that the Iraqi government is considering banning all American passport holders entry to the country -- a decision that could seriously impact the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), with the number of American military and contractors working in Iraq traveling in and out of the country. It\u2019s also possible, the ambassador said, that some Americans inside Iraq could be expelled, according to the official.\n\nOther countries -- even western European nations unaffected by the U.S. travel ban -- have weighed in with their own criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive action. \n\n\u201cThe reception of refugees fleeing the war, fleeing oppression, is part of our duties,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Saturday at a joint news conference with his German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel. \n\nGabriel offered up his own critical views: \u201cThe United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbor is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people...I think that is what unites us in the West, and I think that is what we want to make clear to the Americans.\u201d\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande, who spoke with Mr. Trump Saturday in a phone call, warned the U.S. leader against a trend toward an isolationist foreign policy. \n\n\u201cIn an unstable and uncertain world, turning inward would be a dead end,\u201d Hollande said he told Mr. Trump in their first phone conversation since the president took office last week.\n\nSome European leaders have been reluctant to comment. \n\nWhen British Prime Minister Theresa May was asked her thoughts about the executive order, May told reporters only that \u201cthe United States is responsible for the United States\u2019 policy on refugees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom\u2019s policy on refugees, and our policy on refugees is to have a number of voluntary schemes to bring Syrian refugees into the country, particularly those who are most vulnerable, but also to provide significant financial contributions to support refugees in countries surrounding Syria,\u201d she said.\n\nMay met with Trump Friday in the White House.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.6774191856384295, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 589, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.40698168856, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170129000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.9422750424448205, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/youre-hired-inside-the-interviews-as-trump-picks-cabinet/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [68]}}, "headline": "You're hired?

Several described the meetings as serious, yet conversational, with the president-elect leading the discussion and asking questions extemporaneously, with few notes in front of him.\n\nSenior adviser Steve Bannon and incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus sit in on most of the interviews, occasionally jumping in with their own questions. Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, has also participated in some of the discussions. The meetings, which run up to an hour, are bare-bones affairs, with glasses of water the only refreshment offered.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a cookies and cream kind of deal,\u201d said Sonny Perdue, the former Georgia governor who is in the mix for Trump\u2019s Agriculture secretary. \u201cIt was a business meeting, with a CEO interviewing an applicant for a job.\u201d\n\nIn the month since his victory, Trump has announced picks for about half of the Cabinet, assembling an eclectic group of political insiders, wealthy financiers and campaign loyalists. He\u2019s moving at a faster clip than President Barack Obama, who ran a more traditional and secretive selection process, assigning teams of lawyers to pour through potential nominees\u2019 backgrounds and carefully guarding the names of those being interviewed.\n\nTrump, a one-time reality television star, is carrying out his process with a showman\u2019s touch, at times even deliberating about his choices publicly. Interviewees walk past a gaggle of journalists assembled in the lobby of Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower or on the driveway of his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club before being whisked into their meetings.\n\nThe Manhattan meetings take place in the president-elect\u2019s business office, which features an expansive view of Central Park. Trump sits behind his desk, surrounded by memorabilia and stacks of reading material, the walls dotted with magazine covers and other photos of the real estate mogul.\n\nJohn Allison, the former chairman of BB&T Corp. who was invited to interview for Treasury secretary, said he was not asked to submit any personal or financial information to Trump\u2019s team ahead of the interviews. Still, he said Trump and his senior team had \u201cobviously researched my background.\u201d\n\nOthers who described their interview process to The Associated Press said they, too, were not asked by Trump\u2019s team to provide vetting information, raising questions about how the candidates\u2019 background and financial ties are being scrutinized. Trump advisers did not respond to inquiries about the extent of the vetting process.\n\nPerdue, who was also not asked to submit any personal information, said it appears Trump is interested in the public\u2019s reaction to his potential picks and the issues that surface in the media after their meetings.\n\n\u201cI think they kind of slowly let this stuff out to see what bubbles up,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the process.\u201d\n\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, who is running Trump\u2019s transition, has helped arrange some of the meetings, but is not sitting in on all of them. Those who are invited to meet Trump arrange their own transportation, including secretary of state candidate Mitt Romney, who was spotted waiting in a taxi line at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy airport.\n\nWhile most of Trump\u2019s meetings have been held in Manhattan, Romney\u2019s first meeting with the president-elect took place at the Bedminster golf club. Johnson, the BET founder, also met Trump there, huddling with his longtime acquaintance in a conference room on the property.\n\nJohnson said Trump quickly cut to the chase, asking if he would be interested in joining the Cabinet. Johnson said he didn\u2019t have any interest in working in government but did want to offer his views on issues related to black voters.\n\n\u201cIt ended with me telling him, \u2018I want to be helpful to you if I\u2019ve got an open door to make my case that I think are in the best interests of African-Americans,\u2019 Johnson said.\n\nAllison said his interview focused on economic policy, including taxes and regulation and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, which Trump vowed to dismantle during the campaign. However, Allison said Trump now appears more focused on a major restructuring of the legislation during their hour-long discussions.\n\n\u201cWe agreed that while it would be good to repeal Dodd-Frank, it would be difficult politically,\u201d Allison said.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Trump, Allison said he spent about 20 minutes with Steve Mnuchin, who ran the Trump campaign\u2019s finance operations. Trump ultimately picked Mnuchin for the Treasury job, the one Allison had come in to discuss.\n\nAllison also learned he\u2019d been passed over for the job from Mnuchin.

Others argue the offensive begun by then-President Felipe Calderon on Dec. 11, 2006, unleashed an unnecessary tragedy with more than 100,000 people dead and about 30,000 missing - a toll comparable to the Central American civil wars of the 1980s.\n\nIn some places, homicide rates have lessened. In others, the killings continue unabated. The drawn-out conflict has also had a profound effect on those close to the cross-hairs of suffering: youths inured to extreme violence; adults so fed-up with poor and corrupt policing that they took up arms as vigilantes; and families who banded together in the face of authorities\u2019 inability to find their vanished loved ones.\n\nA law enforcement official in the northern border state of Tamaulipas told The Associated Press he now routinely encounters young cartel gunmen who have few regrets about their vocation. In fact, they see killing as the best way to afford things like smartphones, cars and girlfriends.\n\n\u201cI ask them, \u2018What do you want to be?\u2019 And they say, \u2018To be a chief look-out and have a narco-corrido song written about me,\u201d said the official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name. \u201cAs young as they are, they have no other aspiration in life.\u201d\n\nHe recalled the case of one 16-year-old who kidnapped, killed and mutilated his victims, and then took selfies with the cut-up bodies. A decade into the war, the violence is the only reality his generation has ever known.\n\n\u201cThe kids who are getting arrested now, from about 14 years old and up, they have grown up with crime,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt is something completely normal to them.\u201d\n\nNow the state faces a new challenge: Many of the older cartel gunmen jailed early on were convicted only of lesser weapons charges, as prosecutors are often unable to make organized-crime or money-laundering charges stick, and some are being released and returning to their old ways.\n\nWhile Tamaulipas has calmed somewhat after reaching horrifying murder levels around 2010-2012, there are still shootouts and mass graves and piles of bodies - only no longer as frequently. Arrests and deaths have fractured the hyper-violent Zetas cartel in Tamaulipas, but the result has been a dozen smaller factions at war with each other for control.\n\n\u201cRight now, if there\u2019s anything good in this whole bad situation, it is that these groups don\u2019t have that much power anymore,\u201d former FBI agent Arturo Fontes said. \u201cBut they are divided, and that is why there is a lot of chaos.\u201d\n\nMexico\u2019s armed forces have increasingly been pulled into the conflict because police forces are often corrupt or unreliable. That has had its own toll on the troops, who are frequently ambushed and accused of illegally executing detained cartel suspects in some cases.\n\nDefense Secretary Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos noted that the army\u2019s involvement was only supposed to be temporary while policing was reformed.\n\n\u201cTen years ago it was decided that the police should be rebuilt, and we still haven\u2019t seen that reconstruction,\u201d Cienfuegos said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something that can be solved with bullets. It requires other measures, and there has not been decisive action on budgets to make that happen.\u201d\n\nCalderon launched the drug counteroffensive by sending troops to his home state of Michoacan, where the Familia Michoacana drug gang and later the Knights Templar cartel have dominated many aspects of daily life, such as telling residents when to pick crops and determining what price they would get. Through extortion, the gangs took a cut of every industry in the state.\n\nCitizens formed vigilante groups and largely chased the Knights Templar out, though other gangs have since taken root.\n\n\u201cThings are the same as far as crime,\u201d said Hipolito Mora, the founder of one of the first \u201cself-defense\u201d militias. \u201cThe government has to do more to combat the corruption in itself. If they don\u2019t do that, nothing is going to work. It is the corruption within the government that creates tolerance for organized crime.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Mora, who also owns a lime orchard, said the new cartels no longer try to dictate when he can harvest or burn down the warehouses of people who disobey their orders.\n\nBigger gains can be seen in places like Ciudad Juarez, which is across the border from El Paso, Texas, and where an average of 10 people were killed each day at the height of the city\u2019s violence in 2008-2010. In Chihuahua state, home to Juarez, homicides have fallen by about two-thirds since it began a stepped-up policing effort in 2010.\n\nBut in some places, things seem to be getting worse.\n\nIn the southern state of Guerrero, authorities routinely report grim discoveries: mass graves containing the bodies of kidnap victims, severed human heads dumped in public, federal agents burned to death on a highway. The once-glamorous resort of Acapulco is now one of the world\u2019s deadliest cities.\n\nIn Iguala, Guerrero, where 43 teachers\u2019 college students disappeared in 2014, relatives of other people who have vanished were emboldened enough to form a group to search for their own missing loved ones. So far they have found and gotten authorities to exhume 18 bodies from clandestine graves - a measure of closure at least for those families, when missing-persons cases have long been routinely written off by police.\n\nWhile the government has created support agencies for victims and improved its handling of investigations and bodies, it is grass-roots groups like The Other Disappeared that have mainly been responsible for such small victories.\n\n\u201cIf there has been anything good that has come out of all of this, I would say it is the awakening of the victims,\u201d said group co-founder Adriana Bahena, whose husband disappeared in 2011.\n\nRaul Benitez, a security specialist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said Calderon was right to fight the cartels but argued that the government has failed to stop corruption within its own ranks.\n\n\u201cWithout that,\u201d Benitez said, \u201cthe strategy will always fail.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.08823490142822, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 990, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 14, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.35035858691, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161211210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6363636363636402, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/thousands-protest-trump-victory-across-nation/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [184, 201, 592, 1102, 1375, 1665, 2397, 2704, 3218, 4482, 6563, 7032]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 764, "scraper_regex": 1273}}, "headline": "Thousands protest Trump victory across nation", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1273, "date": "20161110010000", "story_content": "Last Updated Nov 9, 2016 11:53 PM EST\n\nThere were protests throughout the U.S. on Wednesday after Donald Trump\u2019s surprise election victory.\u00a0\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s\u00a0presidential victory set off protests in New York and across the nation Wednesday.\n\nCBS New York reported a small group composed of dozens of protesters grew in numbers that unofficially amounted to between 7,000 and 10,000 \u2013 and the group was still growing by 9 p.m. The protesters took over Fifth Avenue near Trump Tower.\n\nCBS New York confirmed that at least 15 people had been arrested.\u00a0\n\nProtesters started at 6 p.m. in Union Square, and began marching northon Broadway to Sixth Avenue at 7:30 p.m. They eventually ended up at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, and later headed to Trump International Hotel & Tower at Columbus Circle.\n\nThe protesters chanted \u201cNot my president\u201d and \u201chey, hey, ho, ho Donald Trump has got to go.\u201d They held signs that read \u201cTrump Makes America Hate\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Lose Hope.\u201d Some of the protesters cursed out key battleground states that Trump had won to secure victory.\u00a0\n\nOutside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in midtown police installed barricades to keep the demonstrators at bay. Police say the protests have been mostly peaceful. The NYPD tweeted at 8:30 p.m. that they are looking for two men who may have Molotov cocktails at the protest.\u00a0\n\nNYPD looking for two males with possible backpacks full of Molotov cocktails at the anti-Trump protest in Manhattan.\u2014 New York City Alerts (@NYCityAlerts) November 10, 2016\n\nThe signs of his victory were evident in New York, where security barricades were placed in front of Trump Tower.\u00a0\n\nThousands of people are protesting the election of Donald Trump for President of the United States in downtown Los Angeles, CBS Los Angeles reports.\n\nThe protest started at around 7:30 p.m. Wednesday night and may have been organized on Facebook.\n\nCBS Los Angeles was in Sky 9 above the protest that appeared to be disorganized and had no specific start and end point. The crowd was in large numbers on Main Street approaching Temple. There was also a large crowd gathered at the front of City Hall. The Los Angeles police was monitoring the crowd.\n\nAn effigy of Donald Trump was burning but put out quickly.\n\nNo violence has been reported.\n\nProtesters gathered at Philadelphia\u2019s City Hall on Wednesday, CBS Philadelphia reports.\u00a0\n\nHundreds of protesters came together for an event held by the Philadelphia Socialist Alternative. Police say they estimate the number to be around 700.\n\nIn Portland, Dozens of mostly young protesters rallied against President-elect Donald Trump, disrupting traffic and shutting down streets and freeways.\u00a0\n\nDuring the Wednesday gathering people shouted \u201cnot my president\u201d and many carried signs saying things like \u201cLove Trumps Hate.\u201d The Portland Police said a portion of Interstate 5 through the city was briefly closed in both directions because of protest activity. Earlier the protest in downtown drew several Trump supporters, who taunted the demonstrators with signs. At one point, a lone Trump supporter was chased across Pioneer Courthouse Square and hit in the back with a skateboard before others intervened.\u00a0\n\nIn Chicago, hundreds of protesters have gathered outside Chicago\u2019s Trump Tower to express their disapproval of the election results.\n\nAuthorities say police have been stationed outside the hotel and condominium tower since early Wednesday, when it was apparent the Republican Trump had defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in their presidential contest. \n\nThe protest was organized by the groups Freedom First International and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, among others. The organizers contend the protest is designed to show solidarity with Muslims, women, LGBTQ people, poor and working people and Black Lives Matter. \n\nCBS Chicago reports event was billed as an \u201cemergency protest,\u201d and thousands had signed up via Facebook. The demonstration started at 5 p.m. and was expected to last until 9 p.m.\n\nA different event had been planned by another Facebook group \u2014 to \u201cPoint and Laugh at Trump Tower\u201d the day after the election.\n\nThe organizer made some last-minute changes, given Trump\u2019s unexpected victory.\n\nIn Boston, protesters chanting \u201cwe will not be silenced\u201d and carrying signs reading \u201cHe Will Never Be My President\u201d gathered on the steps of the Massachusetts Statehouse following Republican Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory.\u00a0\n\nMany of those chanting and singing hailed from Boston-area colleges and said they were shocked and disillusioned by Democrat Clinton\u2019s loss. Meaghan Schaefer, a 19-year-old political communication student at Emerson College, said she was angry. \n\n\u201cWe were so close to seeing the first woman become president and she lost to a man who has no political experience, who doesn\u2019t represent the majority in this country,\u201d she said. Matthew Bittner said he was in utter disbelief with Trump\u2019s win. \n\nHe said he knows Clinton isn\u2019t perfect, but said he felt like people didn\u2019t want her in office because she\u2019s a woman. \u201cThere\u2019s so much bigotry in this country that we thought was resolved but it was just covered with a blanket,\u201d said the 21-year-old theater student from Suffolk University. \u201cHe wants to bring back a sexist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic society and we will not stand for it.\u201d The two were among hundreds who flocked to the Statehouse holding signs that read \u201cMake Bigots Afraid Again,\u201d chanting \u201cI\u2019m still with her\u201d and singing The Beatles\u2019 \u201cAll You Need is Love.\u201d Massachusetts, a reliably Democratic state in presidential elections, handed its 11 electoral votes to Clinton on Tuesday. The last Republican presidential candidate to win Massachusetts was Ronald Reagan in 1984. \n\nNineteen-year-old Robert Duncan, who is black and a musical theater student at the Boston Conservatory, said he is gay and sees Trump as an oppressor. \u201cHe\u2019s said awful things to people of all different kinds,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cI\u2019m here because I just want to get all my emotions out honestly. I\u2019m sad. I\u2019ve been crying all day.\u201d Many of those protesting said despite Trump\u2019s victory, they have their eyes on the future. \u201cFor the next four years, we just have to do what we can,\u201d Schaefer added. \u201cWe can\u2019t throw away our shot. We\u2019re young. We\u2019re educated. We can make a difference the next time around.\u201d\n\nAt Berkeley, thousands of students walked out of several East Bay high schools Wednesday, protesting Republican Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory, CBS San Francisco reports.\u00a0\n\nStudents at Berkeley High, Bishop O\u2019Dowd, Albany High and Oakland Tech all staged walkouts. Meanwhile, several hundred students staged a noontime rally at San Jose\u2019s Lincoln High School and El Ceritto policesent out an alert at 1 p.m. asking drivers to be careful because walkouts were underway at several Contra Costa County schools.\n\nStudents at a few Phoenix high schools walked out of class Wednesday in protest of Donald Trump\u2019s win, CBS affiliate KPHO reports.\u00a0\n\nAbout 200 students at Carl Hayden High School chanted \u201cOut Donald Trump\u201d as they left school around noon. The high school is located at 35th Avenue and Roosevelt Street.\n\nStudents at Metro Tech, North and Central high schools also staged walkouts.\n\nStudents were seen holding signs and the Mexican flag as they marched to the Arizona State Capitol where they gathered outside the building and then walked a circuit around the plaza. Many of the signs expressed anti-Trump and anti-Sheriff Joe Arpaio sentiments.\n\nArpaio was defeated by Democrat Paul Penzone after 24 years in office.\n\nPhoenix police officers were in the area to keep the students on the sidewalks and unharmed. The protest has remained peaceful.\n\nA small group of students gathered in front of City Hall in downtown Phoenix.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 21, "AuthorityVice": 5, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.34857845306396, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 764, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.828116518119999, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161110010000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998, "FairnessVice": 2, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.581151832460731, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rising-dollar-threatens-trumps-economic-plans/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [56, 2373]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 802, "scraper_regex": 852}}, "headline": "Rising dollar threatens Trump's economic plans", "wordcount_as_scraped": 852, "date": "20161219200000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s ambitious plans to revive exports, return jobs to the United States and increase oil drilling are running up against a home-grown threat: the surging U.S. dollar.\n\nSince the Nov. 8 election, the dollar has shot up 5 percent. An index that tracks the dollar against other major currencies reached a 14-year high after the election before dipping a bit since then.\n\nIn part, the dollar\u2019s gain reflects the U.S. economy\u2019s strength and investor confidence that Trump will accelerate growth by slashing taxes and pumping money into roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The dollar could rise even more now that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates and foresees three more hikes next year. With rates far lower elsewhere in the world, many investors will shift money to the United States to capitalize on higher yields, a shift that could send the dollar even higher.\n\nWhich creates a problem: An expensive dollar makes U.S. goods costlier overseas \u2014 and imports cheaper in the U.S. That\u2019s a recipe for more pain for American manufacturers. A high dollar can also lead some U.S. multinational companies to move operations to countries where their dollars go further.\n\nAnd a high-priced dollar tends to shrink oil prices, thereby discouraging the increased energy production that Trump has made a centerpiece of his economic plans.\n\n\u201cA strong dollar will make it more challenging to boost the international competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing, bring back jobs and increase exports,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nEven before the election, a comparatively strong dollar had slowed U.S. exports for much of the past two years. Exports of goods and services had peaked in October 2014 at $200 billion. The figure fell to $179 billion in March before recovering slightly as the dollar weakened. But then the dollar marched back up and accelerated after Trump\u2019s victory. It was no surprise when U.S. exports fell nearly 2 percent in October, according to the Commerce Department.\n\nConsider what the strong dollar does to U.S. corporate earnings, too: Whatever revenue American companies earn in foreign currencies is worth less once it\u2019s exchanged into U.S. dollars and returned home. In recent weeks, American companies, from Whirlpool (WHR)\u00a0 to Apple (AAPL), have complained that the strong dollar has dented their earnings.\n\nAt Vaughn Manufacturing in Nashville, Tennessee, the company president, Mark Vaughn, is fretting about the dollar\u2019s 11 percent rise against Mexico\u2019s peso since the election. Around 20 percent of Vaughn\u2019s tool-and-die business is done in Mexico. And the company competes with Chinese and Korean companies that aren\u2019t saddled with an expensive currency. \u201cIt\u2019s a concern,\u201d he said.\n\nA rising dollar can encourage U.S. companies to move factories and jobs overseas because it makes foreign investments cheaper. Trump, of course, has pledged to stop American companies from taking operations offshore. He\u2019s even threatened to impose a 35 percent tax on companies that leave America and then ship goods back to the United States.\n\nThe dollar\u2019s rally could also complicate the president-elect\u2019s plans to spur oil drilling by reducing environmental regulations. Oil is usually bought in dollars. So the higher the dollar\u2019s value, the fewer dollars are needed to buy a barrel of oil. The result is that the dollar-denominated price of oil drops.\n\nWhen oil prices drop, energy companies tend to cut investment in drilling and production. Low oil prices are the main reason U.S. business investment plummeted late last year and in the first half of 2016, thereby slowing the economy. Oil prices have risen since Trump\u2019s victory but could retreat again if the dollar keeps rising.\n\nThe Trump transition team didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nWilliam Cline, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said he worries that the strong dollar could incite conflicts between the U.S. and its trading partners \u2014 something that happened during the Reagan administration in the 1980s.\n\nDespite his reputation as a free trader, Reagan used tariffs against Japanese motorcycles and semiconductors, which had enjoyed a price edge in the U.S. market resulting from a sharp rise in the dollar. It took an extraordinary 1985 meeting at New York\u2019s Plaza Hotel to craft an arrangement with Japan, Germany and Britain to reduce the dollar\u2019s value and ease tension.\n\nTrump, who threatened to tear up trade treaties and impose tariffs against Mexico and Japan, might be even quicker to impose sanctions against what he sees as unfair trade practices, potentially triggering a wider trade war. In an analysis it did before the election, the Peterson Institute warned that the United States could lose nearly 4.8 million jobs in a trade war that would result if Trump imposed the tariffs on Mexico and China \u2014 and they responded with equal tariffs of their own.\n\n\u201cThe tricky thing in the case of Trump is if his administration sees trade deficits as the result of unfair trade\u201d and not of economic forces that are pushing the dollar higher, Cline says. \u201cYou could get into a lot of trade conflicts.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.9340158700943, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 802, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.77680184415, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161219200000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 1.9950124688279298, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pearl-harbor-how-fdr-responded-to-the-day-of-infamy/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [453, 739, 1985, 2368, 4475, 4477, 4479]}}, "headline": "Pearl Harbor: How FDR responded to the \"day of infamy\"", "wordcount_as_scraped": 766, "date": "20161204150000", "story_content": "The \u201cDay of Infamy\u201d is how we Americans have come to remember the attack on Pearl Harbor -- and we owe that phrase to the American president who knew exactly what was called for in that moment of crisis. David Martin takes us back:\n\nPresident Roosevelt knew war was coming, but not like this. \n\nOn Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, he was working on his stamp collection in his private study in the White House.\u00a0 It was 1:47 p.m. Washington time.\n\n\u201cThe phone rings at this desk; it is the Secretary of Navy on the line,\u201d said Herman Eberhardt, curator at the FDR Library In Hyde Park, New York. \u201cHe tells the President that the Pearl Harbor naval base is under attack.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s response? \u00a0\u201cFirst reaction was to shout into the phone, \u2018No!\u2019 sort of in a state of disbelief,\u201d Eberhardt said. \n\nThe critical hours that followed were recorded, moment by moment, by the people around the president -- sometimes in hastily-scrawled notes on random scraps of paper, now on display for the 75th anniversary of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe want to take people inside the White House on one of the most important days in American history,\u201d said Paul Sparrow, director of the FDR Library. \u201cIt was the worst day of his presidency. It was the worst military defeat in American history.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think December 7, 1941 is perhaps the most important day in American history,\u201d Sparrow said. \u201cIt is the transition day when we shifted from being an isolationist nation to being a global superpower.\u201d\n\nAt 3:05 in the afternoon, the president convened a war council with his chief military and diplomatic advisors. They described him, Eberhardt said, as \u201cangry but composed. He\u2019s clearly upset, but he is under control and he is processing information, and he\u2019s not losing his cool.\u201d\n\nAt 3:50 -- as Roosevelt noted -- he received this update: \u201cSevere damage. The (battleship) Oklahoma has capsized ... Airfields attacked. Hangers on fire ... Heavy personnel casualties.\u201d\u00a0 Then he turned to his secretary, Grace Tully, to compose a message to the American people.\n\n\u201cShe says that he lit a cigarette, took a long drag on the cigarette, leaned back in his chair and then just began to dictate the speech,\u201d Eberhardt said. \u201cHe dictated most of it without interruption, punctuating, letting her know where the periods and the exclamation points needed to go.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAfter he finished she left the room and typed it up, brought it back to him. And then FDR himself did all of the editing in pencil to his own speech.\u201d \n\nAnd here it is -- edited by Roosevelt in his own hand. Two-and-a-half pages in length, it begins with what would become one of the most famous sentences in American history.\n\n\u201cHe takes that first sentence, which originally read, \u2018Yesterday, December 7, 1941, a date which will live in world history,\u2019 he strikes out \u2018world history,\u2019 changes that to \u2018infamy,\u2019\u201d Eberhardt said. \u201cAnd in the process transforms that sentence into one that really rings down through the decades to us today.\u201d\n\nSparrow said, \u201cSome of his advisors, the Secretary of State, Secretary of War, wanted him to deliver a much longer speech.\u201d\n\nThe State Department drafted a 17-page speech rehashing the history of U.S.-Japanese relations, but Roosevelt set it aside and went with his gut.\n\n\u201cHe knew that the American public wanted to hear that we had been wronged and that we will find a way to victory,\u201d Sparrow said. \n\n\u201cNo matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.\u201d\n\nFor all his public confidence, Roosevelt also had moments of private despair. \u201cHe felt that he was going to go down in history as a terrible president, that this would ruin his place in history,\u201d Sparrow said.\n\nWhen he addressed the joint session of Congress, Roosevelt -- who was paralyzed by polio from the waist down -- insisted on walking to and from the podium.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s supporting his weight as he did in public on a cane and on his son\u2019s arm,\u201d Eberhardt said. \u201cBy holding his weight in that manner, he\u2019s able to pitch his body forward slowly and walk to the rostrum to deliver the speech.\u201d\n\nSparrow added, \u201cHe put the weight of the world on his paralyzed legs and carried America from the past into the future, and changed us from an isolationist nation into a global superpower.\u201d\n\nThe speech lasted just 6 1/2 minutes. But it transformed the nation from a state of shock into a state of war.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For more info: ", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.0764331817627, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 730, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 10, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.09892009983, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161204150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.7397260273972597, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/issues-that-matter-2016-election-obamacare-premium-health-care-costs-david-agus-steven-brill/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [313, 738, 1388, 1710, 2630, 3256, 3786, 4192]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 667, "scraper_regex": 725}}, "headline": "Issues That Matter: Dr. David Agus, Steven Brill on rising health care costs", "wordcount_as_scraped": 725, "date": "20161103200000", "story_content": "In this installment of our series \u201cIssues That Matter,\u201d CBS News contributor Dr. David Agus and Steven Brill, author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bitter Pill,\u201d join \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d to discuss the costly health care issues facing the next president. \u00a0\n\nSkyrocketing premium prices have made the Affordable Care Act a hot topic on the campaign trail. Some states have seen double-digit percentages and by next year, some popular plans will increase by an average of 25 percent \u2013 more than three times this year\u2019s increase. Major insurance companies are also cutting back on participation in the exchange program. \n\nSo what\u2019s going wrong with Obama\u2019s signature health care law?\u00a0\n\n\u201cOne of the premises is young people who never get sick would enter the system, contribute their dollars and it would subsidize the people because as you get older, you get more and more ailments and it would start to even out. These young people said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to pay a fee, I don\u2019t want to enter,\u2019 because the prices are going too high,\u201d Dr. David Agus explained on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d Thursday. \u201cSo when you don\u2019t have that angle, that seesaw tips.\u201d\n\nStill, Agus thinks Obamacare is \u201cgreat\u201d because it got the principle right \u2013 that everyone should have a right to health care. Twenty million more Americans now have health care coverage.\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut any policy needs to be refined,\u201d Agus said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just put out a policy and it\u2019s going to work from day one, especially something as complex as health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut beyond Obamacare, premiums are going up for those of us that aren\u2019t even on Obamacare,\u201d co-host Norah O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cHow is that justifiable?\u201d \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s justifiable if we continue to be the only country in the developed world that doesn\u2019t control the price of prescription drugs that allows so-called \u2018nonprofit hospitals\u2019 to make exorbitant profits, charging ridiculous prices in paying exorbitant salaries to its non-doctor executives,\u201d Brill said.\n\nBrill, too, agrees that Obamacare has kept its promise to make health care accessible to more people. But he said it hasn\u2019t kept its second promise. \n\n\u201cIt also promised kind of vaguely \u2013 because it was a promise they could never keep \u2013 that it was going to do something to control the cost of health care. It has done nothing to do that.\u201d\n\nOn Obamacare, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump stand on opposite ends of spectrum. Clinton wants to expand the act and help people buy into Medicare earlier. Trump wants to repeal it all together and drop the requirement that everyone buy insurance or pay a penalty.\u00a0\n\nDr. Agus is against the latter idea. Instead, he argues, we should reform it by getting more people into the system, so that a small proportion of sicker people don\u2019t deplete its financial stability.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is 5 percent of people spending 50 percent of the dollars in the Affordable Care Act. And so a number of people who are very ill are taking a disproportionate portion of the resources,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut that not just Obamacare. That\u2019s true in general,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\n\n\u201cAnd it is not new, we\u2019ve known that,\u201d co-host Charlie Rose jumped in.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve seen those figures jump out at us,\u201d Agus responded. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s because people are getting older and we still have the same system before which is the more tests the doctor does, the more exams, the more everybody gets paid, and Obamacare does have some pilot project to try to go after that, they haven\u2019t really been successful so far,\u201d Brill responded.\n\nFor Brill, the \u201ccore issue\u201d is to address the rising price of health care, which he called a \u201cmonopoly market.\u201d \n\n\u201cI think the summary really is that the Affordable Care Act helps people. Both candidates want to change it\u00a0but this is a bipartisan issue. Health care is not partisan and I think that is really the message,\u201d Agus said. \u201cIt is partisan because you have abortion \u2013 yes, no. It\u2019s partisan because they want the term kicked out. No matter how you do it, you\u2019re not going to be able to remove health care from 20 million people. So the parties have to work together.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be repealed,\u201d Brill agreed. \u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.541271984577179, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 667, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.8203457071699995, "HarmVirtue": 14, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161103200000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.8980509745127403, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/melvin-laird-defense-secretary-under-richard-nixon-has-died-at-94/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Melvin Laird, defense secretary under Nixon, has died at 94", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1006, "date": "20161117000000", "story_content": "MARSHFIELD, Wis. -- Melvin Laird, a former Wisconsin congressman and U.S. defense secretary during years when President Nixon struggled to find a way to withdraw troops from an unpopular war in Vietnam, died on Wednesday, his family said. He was 94.\n\nHis grandson, Raymond Dennis Large III, said that Laird died in Florida.\n\nLaird left a legacy that included a telephone call that eventually played a role in one of the biggest political stories of the century - the Watergate scandal that drove Nixon from office.\n\nLaird was Nixon\u2019s counselor on domestic affairs in October 1973 when Nixon had to replace Vice President Spiro Agnew, who had resigned in scandal. Laird called his good friend, Michigan Rep. Gerald Ford, to ask if he would be interested in replacing Agnew.\n\n\u201cFrankly, the question came like a bolt out of the blue,\u201d Ford said in 1997, recalling his conversation with the \u201ccan-do conservative\u201d from Wisconsin.\n\nFord accepted. About a year later, Nixon resigned because of Watergate and Ford became president. Ford pardoned Nixon, and two years later, Ford lost the presidential election to Jimmy Carter.\n\n\u201cI thought Ford was the right person to bring the country together after the Watergate fiasco,\u201d Laird once said, taking credit with Bryce Harlow for persuading Nixon to pick Ford.\n\nFord once praised Laird as a patriot before a partisan.\n\nHis grandson Large, who is the son of Alison Laird Large, called his grandfather \u201cone of the lions of our republic.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe truly was someone that worked across party lines,\u201d Large said. \u201cHe was a very dedicated Republican but he was able to see the human in everyone. His work speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nFormer Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, is married to Laird\u2019s niece Jessica. He said that Laird remained engaged with public issues until the end of his life.\n\n\u201cEven at the end Jessica would get two, sometimes more, letters a week from him, handwritten letters. I think last week she had one discussing the election, public issues, his views of things.\u201d\n\nLaird, the son of a Presbyterian minister, was 30 when he was elected to the U.S. House in 1952. He represented Wisconsin\u2019s 7th District - mostly dairy-farming or lumber-producing counties in central Wisconsin - for nine terms, and was credited with helping spearhead the vast expansion of medical research and health facilities in the U.S.\n\nNixon appointed Laird as the nation\u2019s 10th defense secretary in 1969 and the first to come from Congress. The Vietnam War raged, with no end in sight for the 550,000 troops stationed in the Southeast Asian country as America lost its resolve for the fighting.\n\nLaird coined the term \u201cVietnamization\u201d to describe Nixon\u2019s policy of assigning an ever-increasing combat role to South Vietnamese troops, allowing the pullout of U.S. forces.\n\nWhen Laird stepped down as defense secretary in January 1973, there were about 69,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam.\n\n\u201cAs a consequence of the success of the military aspects of Vietnamization, the South Vietnamese people today, in my view, are fully capable of providing for their own in-country security against the North Vietnamese,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nHowever, Saigon fell under communist control in 1975. But the problem, Laird wrote later, was not Vietnamization but the United States\u2019 failure to provide continued financial support while the Soviet Union was sending Hanoi far more than the limit it had agreed to.\n\n\u201cWe grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory ... when Congress cut off the funding for South Vietnam that had allowed it to continue to fight on its own,\u201d he wrote in 2005 in the publication Foreign Affairs.\n\nWhile at the Pentagon, Laird ended the military draft and established the all-volunteer force. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very successful program,\u201d he said in 1997. \u201cI am very proud that I was there as secretary of defense to start it.\u201d\n\nDoyle said Laird will be viewed \u201cthrough the crucible of Vietnam\u201d but it shouldn\u2019t be lost on people that he ended the draft. He was also proud to be a politician and viewed it as an honorable profession, Doyle said.\n\n\u201cHe was a Republican that really believed government was a worthy cause, that politics was a worthy effort,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 1973, Nixon brought Laird to the White House as counselor on domestic affairs. Several months later, the Watergate crisis deepening, Laird resigned.\n\nThe Laird Center, a complex for medical research at Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin, is named after Laird, who grew up in Marshfield.\n\nLaird often said Marshfield Clinic doctors encouraged him to get involved in health issues after he was elected to Congress, including his involvement in legislation that made health maintenance organizations possible.\n\nLaird was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on Sept. 1, 1922, and the family moved to Marshfield when he was a young child. He graduated from Carleton College in Minnesota in 1942 and served aboard the Navy destroyer U.S.S. Maddox in the Pacific during World War II.\n\nLaird was elected to his first political office in 1946, when he succeeded his late father, Melvin Sr., as a state senator in the Wisconsin Legislature. At the time, Laird, only 23, was the youngest state senator in the United States.\n\nWhen the Laird Center was dedicated, Henry Kissinger recalled the many power struggles he had, as Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, with Secretary of Defense Laird, needling him on a day when political nostalgia and good humor filled the air.\n\n\u201cI always sent deputies to deal with him, and I would give them several pieces of advice,\u201d Kissinger said in his deadpan voice. \u201cFirst, you must remember Mel Laird is extremely smart. Second, he knows he is extremely smart. Third, he will let you know he is extremely smart. Fourth, it is much less painful to let him do what he wants. Fifth, when he says, \u2018You know what I mean,\u2019 there is no conceivable way you could know what he means. And sixth, when he calls to complain about a newspaper story, you know he has put it out himself.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.387972831726074, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 977, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.05343349443, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161117000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 3.2753326509723597, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/muslim-backlash-georgia-lawmaker-change-no-mask-law/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "After Muslim backlash, Georgia lawmaker drops change to no-mask law", "wordcount_as_scraped": 722, "date": "20161118160000", "story_content": "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Advocates accused a Georgia lawmaker of targeting Muslim women with proposed changes to a 1951 state law passed to unmask the Ku Klux Klan, creating a backlash that prompted the Republican legislator to quickly discard the idea.\n\nState Rep. Jason Spencer came under fire from the American Civil Liberties Union and Muslim advocacy groups who called his proposal a veiled attempt to ban Muslim women from wearing scarves and other religious headgear that covers their faces in public - just as the law has prohibited Klan members from wearing masks during rallies and marches on public property.\n\n\u201cIt is a naked and despicable attempt to exploit the current wave of anti-Muslim sentiment by targeting Muslim women,\u201d Heather Weaver, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, said Thursday.\n\nSpencer said the bill he introduced for next year\u2019s session of the Georgia Legislature would simply be \u201cadding clarity\u201d to a law passed decades ago to safeguard against what he called \u201cthreats from masked terrorists.\u201d And he insisted he wasn\u2019t targeting any specific group.\n\nBut by Thursday evening Spencer announced in a statement posted on the Georgia House website that he was withdrawing his proposal \u201cdue to the visceral reaction it has created.\u201d He confirmed the decision in an email to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWhile this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created,\u201d Spencer\u2019s statement said. \u201cMy objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety.\u201d\n\nOne thing neither side mentioned amid the controversy: Georgia\u2019s highest court has narrowly interpreted the 1951 law to apply only when one wears a mask to intimidate others.\n\nSpencer\u2019s bill made no mention of Islam or religious garments, but it clearly took aim at women. Although the existing law states that a person commits a misdemeanor \u201cwhen he wears a mask\u201d or other face-hiding garment on public property, Spencer\u2019s version would amend it to read \u201che or she.\u201d\n\nThe proposal also would have banned people from wearing anything that conceals their faces in photographs used for Georgia driver\u2019s licenses and other official state IDs - something the Georgia Department of Driver Services already prohibits.\n\n\u201cIt makes it clear the law is targeted at people of faith, especially women who wear face veils,\u201d said Edward Ahmed Mitchell, executive director of the Georgia chapter of the Council of American-Islamic Relations. \u201cThis is a slap in the face of Georgia Muslims.\u201d\n\nAisha Yaqoob, executive director of the Georgia Muslim Voter Project, said the lawmaker\u2019s proposal came at a frightening time considering \u201cthe rhetoric we saw during the election season.\u201d\n\nKnown as the \u201cAnti-Mask Act,\u201d the original law was approved 65 years ago when masked Klansmen used threats and violence to intimidate blacks and other minority groups in Georgia. Supporters of the law argued masked hoods allowed Klan members to terrorize in anonymity. Victims of Klan violence could rarely identify their attackers for prosecution.\n\nThat law has never been used to stop people from covering their heads or faces for religious reasons. And it doesn\u2019t look like that would have been allowed even if Spencer\u2019s bill became law.\n\nIn 1990, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected a suing Klan member\u2019s argument that the anti-mask law \u201ccriminalizes a substantial amount of innocent behavior\u201d such as wearing a ski mask in the winter or wearing sunglasses.\n\nIn upholding the anti-mask law, Georgia\u2019s high court ruled it applied \u201conly to mask-wearing conduct\u201d that \u201cprovokes a reasonable apprehension of intimidation, threats or violence.\u201d\n\nUnder the court\u2019s narrow interpretation, the lawmaker\u2019s proposed changes wouldn\u2019t apply to Muslim women \u201cbecause they\u2019re not wearing their gear to intimidate anybody,\u201d said Michael Perry, a law professor at Emory University who specializes in constitutional law and religion.\n\n\u201cThe only effect there of adding \u2018she\u2019 is it makes clear what was already known - that the law applies to female Klan members as well as male Klan members,\u201d Perry said.\n\nSpencer\u2019s proposal to prohibit face-covering garb in driver\u2019s license photos was essentially redundant. The Georgia Department of Driver Services allows people to wear religious headgear in their photos - but its rules say any headscarves or other coverings must be adjusted to make the entire face visible.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.77867746353149, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 689, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 16, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.48136637959, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161118160000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.644412191582, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/education-pick-betsy-devos-argues-for-school-choice-disavows-conversion-therapy/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 583, "scraper_regex": 624}}, "headline": "Education pick Betsy DeVos argues for school choice, disavows conversion therapy", "wordcount_as_scraped": 624, "date": "20170118020000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON -- Education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos said Tuesday that American parents must be able to send their children to high-quality schools, including charter, magnet and religious schools, if public schools are failing.\n\nResponding to fierce criticism from teachers unions that the Republican donor and school choice activist is working against public education, DeVos told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that she will be \u201ca strong advocate for great public schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cif a school is troubled, or unsafe, or not a good fit for a child - perhaps they have a special need that is going unmet - we should support a parent\u2019s right to enroll their child in a high-quality alternative.\u201d\n\nCommittee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., a former education secretary, expressed confidence that DeVos is an \u201cexcellent\u201d choice for the job. \u201cShe is on the side of our children,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Sen.

She and her family have donated millions of dollars to Republican politicians and groups over the years, including campaign contributions to several committee members.\n\nMurray, in a statement, said she wants DeVos to answer questions about her \u201cextensive financial entanglements and potential conflicts of interest\u201d and also to provide additional information about her finances, calling her disclosures incomplete.

But decades-old programs that millions of Americans rely on every day, such as Social Security and Medicare, also will be in the crosshairs as congressional Republicans seek to shrink both the size of the federal budget and the bureaucracy in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot to do - and a lot to undo,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said in a letter to fellow Republicans.\n\nDemocrats will try to block the far-reaching conservative agenda by swaying public opinion and using the power they have in the Senate to filibuster legislation. But that strategy has its political limitations. Twenty-three Senate Democrats are up for re-election in 2018, including 10 from states won by President-elect Donald Trump, and they could break ranks and side with the GOP.\n\n\u201cWhat we will always do is hold the president-elect and his Republican colleagues in Congress accountable,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in prepared remarks Tuesday. \u201cWe will be a caucus that works to make sure the president-elect keeps his commitment to truly make America great, in its finest sense and tradition.\u201d\n\nObama plans a rare trip to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with congressional Democrats and discuss strategy for saving the health care law. Vice President-elect Mike Pence will meet with Republicans.\n\nThe first week of the new Congress will be a preview of the hectic pace planned by Republicans.\n\nThe House will vote on Tuesday on a rules package that would gut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, placing it under the purview of the lawmaker-run House Ethics Committee. Democrats and watchdog groups angrily denounced the notion of Congress\u2019 self-policing.\n\nThe rules package, which Republicans drafted behind closed doors without public debate Monday, also would give GOP leaders the tools to punish lawmakers if there is a repeat of the Democratic sit-in last summer over gun control.\n\nVotes also are expected on resolutions to denounce the United Nations for condemning the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Republicans blasted the Obama administration for refusing to veto the decision. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., pledged \u201cto reverse the damage done by this administration, and rebuild our alliance with Israel.\u201d\n\nJames Clapper, the director of national intelligence, is scheduled to testify Thursday before the Senate Armed Services Committee on an intelligence community assessment that Russia interfered in the U.S. election by hacking into Democratic email accounts. Allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. political process will be examined by individual congressional committees, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has rejected a bipartisan call for a special, high-profile select panel to investigate.\n\nObama last week slapped Russia with sweeping penalties over the hacking allegations, yet Trump has not publicly accepted the conclusion Moscow was behind the election year intrusions. Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that \u201cthere doesn\u2019t seem to be conclusive evidence\u201d that the Russians were responsible.\n\nThe House is slated to vote Friday to certify Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election over Democrat Hillary Clinton. She is the fifth presidential candidate to win the popular vote and lose the Electoral College. She received nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump, according to an Associated Press analysis, giving her the largest popular vote margin of any losing presidential candidate and bringing renewed calls to abolish the Electoral College.\n\nOther must-do items on the GOP\u2019s agenda are an overhaul of the U.S. tax code. Conservatives also want to scuttle rules on the environment and undo financial regulations created in the aftermath of the 2008 economic meltdown, arguing they are too onerous for businesses to thrive.\n\nThe Senate plans to begin repealing Obama\u2019s health care law on Tuesday, with consideration of a procedural measure that will shield the initiative from Democratic filibusters.\n\nLawmakers will then spend the next few months working on legislation canceling broad swaths of the law. Likely to go are its mandate that people buy health insurance or face IRS fines, and its expansion of Medicaid coverage to more lower-earning Americans. But several elements of the repeal likely wouldn\u2019t go into effect for two to four years.\n\nAmid the busy legislative schedule, the Senate will exercise its advice and consent role and consider Trump\u2019s picks for his Cabinet.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.73291921615601, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 741, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.5767846496199995, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170103130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.7786774628879907, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nycnew-jersey-bombing-suspect-ahmad-rahimi-pleads-not-guilty-attempted-murder/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [612, 952, 1410, 1522, 1942, 1944, 1962, 2738]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 560, "scraper_regex": 598}}, "headline": "NYC, N.J. bombing suspect Ahmad Rahimi pleads not guilty to attempted murder", "wordcount_as_scraped": 598, "date": "20161220160000", "story_content": "ELIZABETH, N.J.- The man accused of setting off bombs in New Jersey and New York, injuring more than 30 people, has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges.\n\nAhmad Khan Rahimi, 28, made his first in-person court appearance Tuesday to face charges he tried to kill police officers before they captured him Sept. 19 outside a bar in Linden, New Jersey.\n\nAn attorney previously entered not-guilty pleas when the Afghan-born U.S. citizen was hospitalized with gunshot wounds from the shootout.\n\nHe remains held on $5.2 million bail. \u00a0\n\nHe is accused of detonating a pipe bomb along the route of a scheduled Marine Corps charity race in the New Jersey shore town of Seaside Park and a pressure cooker bomb in New York City on Sept. 17. No one was injured in the New Jersey blast, and 31 people were hurt in the New York blast. A second pressure cooker bomb did not explode. \u00a0\n\nDuring a video court appearance on Oct. 13, he was read his rights by Judge Regina Caulfield and answered \u201cyes\u201d in a faint voice to a series of questions.\n\nOn the night of the bombing, investigators said a car left Rahami\u2019s home in Elizabeth, New Jersey, drove through the Lincoln Tunnel and arrived in Manhattan around 6:30 p.m. Surveillance video apparently shows Rahami walking down 23rd Street about 37 minutes before a blast ripped through the block.\u00a0 A short time later, he allegedly turned up on 27th Street where an unexploded pressure cooker bomb was found. \u00a0\n\nWhen he was arrested, Rahami was carrying a journal with handwritten praise for Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan, radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden. The journal also contained references to martyrdom, pipe bombs and pressure cooker bombs.\n\nRahami allegedly wrote: \u201c[God willing,] the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gunshots to your police. Death to your oppression.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWhile officials\u00a0say Rahami traveled to Afghanistan multiple times, and at least once to Pakistan, it\u2019s not clear at all what exactly he did while in those places. An Afghan official told CBS News that during Rahami\u2019s last trip there, in 2014, he is believed to have traveled over land from Pakistan, as there is no record of him having entered through Afghanistan\u2019s airports.\n\nNew Jersey state Rep. Albio Sires said Rahami called his office in 2014 seeking help getting his wife a U.S. visa because her Pakistani passport was expired.\n\nSires said his office wrote a letter to the U.S. embassy in Pakistan to check on the status of the case and that the woman eventually received a visa. He says he doesn\u2019t know if she ever came to the country and the FBI didn\u2019t answer when asked on Monday. \u00a0\n\nRahami wasn\u2019t on any terror or no-fly watch lists, though he had been interviewed for immigration purposes traveling between the U.S. and Afghanistan.\n\nRahami and his family lived above their restaurant - called First American Fried Chicken - in Elizabeth, N.J. and the family has clashed with the city over closing times and noise complaints, which the Rahamis said in a lawsuit were tinged with anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nThe lawsuit was terminated in 2012 because one of Rahami\u2019s brothers had pleaded guilty to blocking police from enforcing closing hours at the restaurant.\n\nA childhood friend, Flee Jones, said Rahami had become more religious after returning from a trip to Afghanistan several years ago. Still, some of the family restaurant\u2019s customers said Rahami was more likely to talk about his interest in cars than to mention faith.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.6051778793335, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 560, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.31110955471, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161220160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.7857142857142903, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-effectively-bars-two-democratically-elected-hong-kong-lawmakers-from-office/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 712, "scraper_regex": 756}}, "headline": "China effectively bars two democratically elected Hong Kong lawmakers from office", "wordcount_as_scraped": 756, "date": "20161107040000", "story_content": "BEIJING -- China\u2019s top legislature effectively barred two democratically elected separatist lawmakers from taking office in Hong Kong with a ruling Monday on the city\u2019s constitution, an intervention into a local political dispute that\u2019s likely to spark further turmoil in the southern Chinese city.\n\nThe National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee in Beijing said it adopted an interpretation of an article in Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution on oath-taking. It acted after a provocative display of anti-China sentiment by two newly elected pro-independence Hong Kong lawmakers at their swearing-in ceremony last month.\n\nThousands of people protested in Hong Kong on Sunday, demanding that China\u2019s central government stay out of the political dispute, saying the move would undermine the city\u2019s considerable autonomy and independent judiciary. Police used pepper spray and batons to contain some of the demonstrators, arresting two.\n\nIn issuing the interpretation, the National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee said talk of independence for Hong Kong is intended to \u201cdivide the country\u201d and severely harms the country\u2019s unity, territorial sovereignty and national security.\n\nThe interpretation says that those who advocate for independence for Hong Kong are not only disqualified from election and from assuming posts as lawmakers but should also be investigated for their legal obligations.\n\nLee Cheuk-yan, a former pro-democracy lawmaker who was among the protesters, said Hong Kong residents were concerned that Beijing was encroaching on their relative freedoms, such as freedom of speech and expression.\n\n\u201cWe may not agree with the two (newly elected lawmakers), their language, but we have to protect their rights because they are elected members,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIf (Beijing) can deprive them this time, they can deprive others because of other speeches or language or protest.\u201d\n\nAfter the protest march, several thousand people protested in the evening outside Beijing\u2019s liaison office. Police used pepper spray and batons on demonstrators amid some scuffling.\n\nSome protesters wore face masks and hoisted open umbrellas -- symbols reminiscent of student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 that swelled to such numbers they blocked key Hong Kong streets.\n\nHelmeted police officers with shields stood in several rows, creating a blockade against the protesters. \u201cOpen the road! Open the road!\u201d the demonstrators chanted, as police warned them not to charge.\n\nSenior police superintendent Tse Kwok-wai said police arrested two men, aged 39 and 57, one for obstructing police work and the other for failing to show his identity card. \u201cPolice strongly condemn protesters for breaking the law,\u201d Tse said.\n\nDemonstrators held signs reading \u201cDefend the rule of law\u201d and calling for the city\u2019s Beijing-backed chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, to step down.\n\nSome said that if China\u2019s top legislative panel issued its own interpretation on oath-taking, it would effectively undermine a Hong Kong court\u2019s ongoing review of the case.\n\n\u201cIn (the) long run, that will damage our confidence in the court,\u201d said Alvin Yeung, a legislator.\n\nThe legislative panel in Beijing said the words and actions of the two Hong Kong lawmakers - Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching - \u201cposed a grave threat to national sovereignty and security,\u201d Xinhua reported.\n\nIf such a situation were to persist, the Standing Committee said, it would hurt the interests of Hong Kong\u2019s residents and China\u2019s progress. \u201cThe central government cannot sit idly and do nothing,\u201d it said.\n\nThe interpretation involves an article in Hong Kong\u2019s constitution, known as the Basic Law, that covers oaths taken by lawmakers.\n\nLast month, Leung, 30, and Yau, 25, who are from the radical Youngspiration party, altered their oaths to insert a disparaging Japanese term for China. Displaying a flag reading \u201cHong Kong is not China,\u201d they vowed to defend the \u201cHong Kong nation.\u201d Leung crossed his fingers, while Yau used the F-word in her pledge.\n\nTheir oaths were ruled invalid, but subsequent attempts have resulted in mayhem in the legislature\u2019s weekly sessions.\n\nSaturday\u2019s comments indicated that the Standing Committee intended to use its interpretation of the article to send a strong message against separatism - and could ultimately lead to the democratically elected lawmakers\u2019 disqualification from office.\n\nSuch an outcome would be favorable to China\u2019s Communist leaders, who are alarmed by the former British colony\u2019s burgeoning independence movement, but is also likely to plunge their troubled relationship into fresh turmoil.\n\nMaria Tam, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People\u2019s Congress, told reporters in Beijing on Saturday that the Standing Committee has the \u201cfinal say\u201d on the dispute, and that Hong Kong\u2019s highest court would accept the panel\u2019s interpretation as binding.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.21994876861572, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 712, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.27454472785, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161107040000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.23033707865169, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-year-celebrations-times-square-2017/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [282, 356, 987, 1238, 1251, 1446, 1447, 2812, 4782, 7511]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 647, "scraper_regex": 1295}}, "headline": "\"The energy here is like out of control\": Times Square kicks off American New Year celebrations", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1295, "date": "20170101060000", "story_content": "Last Updated Jan 1, 2017 3:15 AM EST\n\nNEW YORK CITY -- An estimated 2 million people ushered in the new year in Times Square, screaming and kissing as the glittering crystal ball dropped.\u00a0\n\nAnd millions more tuned in to watch Mariah Carey\u2019s botched performance.\u00a0\n\nThe celebration came as a major terror attack struck a New Year\u2019s celebration overseas.

It\u2019s so fun. The energy here is like out of control. You\u2019re just like with tons of other crazy people \u2013 it\u2019s totally worth it!\u201d\n\nSome revelers got in before noon \u2013 and even before dawn \u2013 to see the festivities.\n\nMeghan and Madison are in town from Atlanta with friends. Last year, they arrived too late to get in, so this year, they got to the party nice and early \u2014 at 6 a.m.\n\n\u201cLast year I was late. I got here at 7 p.m. so I missed it all,\u201d Meghan said.\n\nStefania Moran, from Puebla, Mexico, and five friends traveled to New York to secure a coveted spot in one of 35 metal pens where re-entry was prohibited.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come to New York, and this is one of the must-dos before you die,\u201d she said. Dozens of 20-ton sanitation trucks weighted with an extra 15 tons of sand blocked off streets leading to the celebration zone to avoid the possibility of a truck attack like those in Germany and France in recent months. About 7,000 police officers, along with specially armed counterterrorism units and bomb-sniffing dogs, were on guard. \n\nNYPD Commissioner James O\u2019Neill told CBS New York that his department is well-prepared.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely ready for it. We\u2019ve been preparing for this since January 2 of 2016. This is an event that we do well. We\u2019re well-versed in this. We have a lot of large events in New York City every year, and this is one of the biggest along with Thanksgiving and Fourth of July,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.\n\nChief of Department Carlos Gomez explained the tight security this year \u2013 including the sanitation trucks full of sand and much more.\n\n\u201cWe have thousands of officers here in Times Square, as well as in other venues throughout the city. As you see, you walk nearby, you\u2019ll see an officer within 10 or 15 feet. We have several ways of screening \u2013 you get screened before you enter Times Square, and before you enter the pen, you will be screened,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nO\u2019Neill noted that his own family was coming to Times Square Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing some of my nieces and nephews down to Times Square tonight. My two sons are busy \u2013 they\u2019re doing other things \u2013 but I look forward to it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re coming down here, just know that the NYPD is going to do what they get paid to do, and that\u2019s to keep the people of this city safe.\u201d\n\nIn Las Vegas, federal officials have ranked the celebration just below the Super Bowl and on par with the festivities in Times Square, CBS affiliate KLAS reports. FBI and Secret Service agents will work alongside local police departments that are putting all hands on deck for the big night. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned about safety,\u201d said 35-year-old tourist Jonathan Potwana, who was visiting Las Vegas from South Africa and snapped a picture with a group of uniformed officers milling outside of downtown bars. \u201cWhen we see visible policing, we feel much safer.\u201d The heart of the Las Vegas Strip was closed to vehicle traffic starting Saturday evening so pedestrians could stroll the famous boulevard in the misty weather that was expected to drop to the mid-40s around midnight. \n\nPolice ramped up barriers this year to prevent cars from reaching partiers, and a new county ordinance prohibited large bags, strollers, backpacks and glass bottles on the Strip for the party. Las Vegas police spokeswoman Laura Meltzer said there were no significant incidents reported as of two hours before the new year, but officers had to remind people of the bag rule, which aimed to prevent people from hiding dangerous items. Clark County fire officials said they took seven people from the Las Vegas Strip area to the hospital over the course of the evening, although none of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening. A fireworks show synchronized to music - including the standard Auld Lang Syne and Prince\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d - was planned for midnight. Revelers can watch the spectacle from unusual vantage points, including from the windows of a helicopter tour and the cabin of the High Roller, the world\u2019s tallest observation wheel. Casinos are pulling out all the stops for the holiday. Headliners at Las Vegas\u2019 swanky nightclubs include DJ Calvin Harris, rappers T-Pain and Kendrick Lamar and artists Drake and Bruno Mars. At a lower-key celebration in downtown Las Vegas\u2019 casino-flanked Fremont Street Experience, bands played under a video canopy while visitors sipped giant beers. Ken and Linda Troyan of Peoria, Illinois were decked in a light-up \u201cHappy New Year\u201d hat and \u201c2017\u201d glasses as they took in a concert. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to a new adventure in our career,\u201d said Linda Troyan, 54. She added, \u201c2017\u2019s going to be awesome.\u201d The couple said they\u2019re excited to expand their carpet cleaning business and do renovations on their home in the new year. Some tourists said 2016 was a year of disappointment. Colorado Springs resident Virginia Quill, 54, said she wished she had a better-paying job in 2016 and wasn\u2019t thrilled that Donald Trump won the presidency. But even those who troubled by the political climate were finding a silver lining as they looked toward 2017. \u201cOur president-elect has got to stop running his mouth ... he looks like he wants a war,\u201d said Albany resident Mike Mogavero, 47, who was spending New Year\u2019s Eve with his wife Marissa. \u201cThat same bravado might actually get things done.\u201d\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.3986014127731299, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 647, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.42330370614, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170101060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5548686244203997, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/yahya-jammeh-gambia-exile-adama-barrow/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [703, 5394]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 843, "scraper_regex": 887}}, "headline": "Gambian leader, who once vowed to rule 1 billion years, flees into exile", "wordcount_as_scraped": 887, "date": "20170122030000", "story_content": "BANJUL, Gambia -- Gambia\u2019s defeated leader Yahya Jammeh and his family headed into political exile Saturday night, ending a 22-year reign of fear and a post-election political standoff that threatened to provoke a regional military intervention when he clung to power. As he mounted the stairs to the plane, he turned to the crowd, kissed his Quran and waved one last time to supporters, including soldiers who cried at his departure. The flight came almost 24 hours after Jammeh announced on state television he was ceding power to the newly inaugurated Adama Barrow, in response to mounting international pressure for his ouster.\u00a0\n\nThough tens of thousands of Gambians had fled the country during his rule, Jammeh supporters flocked to the airport to see him walk the red carpet to his plane. Women shouted: \u201cDon\u2019t go! Don\u2019t go!\u201d Jammeh landed in Guinea an hour later. He and his family then took off for Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea, according to an airport official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak to the press. Equatorial Guinea, unlike Guinea, is not a state party to the International Criminal Court. \u201cWhat is fundamental here is he will live in a foreign country as of now,\u201d Barrow told The Associated Press earlier Saturday. Barrow won the December elections, but Jammeh contested the results as calls grew for him to be prosecuted for alleged abuses during his time in power. A regional force had been poised to force out Jammeh if last-ditch diplomatic efforts failed to persuade him to leave. The situation became so tense that Barrow had to be inaugurated in neighboring Senegal at the Gambian Embassy on Thursday, after Jammeh\u2019s mandate expired at midnight. Barrow told The Associated Press he would return to Gambia once it is \u201cclear\u201d and a security sweep is completed. Shortly after Jammeh\u2019s departure, the United Nations, African Union and the West African regional bloc, ECOWAS, issued a declaration saying that any country offering him and his family \u201cAfrican hospitality\u201d should not be punished and that he should be free to return to Gambia in the future. It said Jammeh was leaving \u201ctemporarily.\u201d The joint statement did not include promises of amnesty but said the world and regional bodies \u201ccommit to work with the government of the Gambia to prevent the seizure of assets and properties lawfully belonging to former President Jammeh or his family and those of his Cabinet members, government officials and party supporters.\u201d Jammeh, who seized power in a coup in 1994, once vowed to rule for a billion years. He represented one of a dwindling number of West African leaders staying in office without apparent limit. The success in getting him to leave peacefully may help the vast region move toward more stable transfers of power. His departure has brought an end to the political crisis in this impoverished nation of 1.9 million, which promotes itself to overseas tourists as \u201cthe Smiling Coast of Africa\u201d while being a major source of migrants heading north toward Europe. As Jammeh prepared to leave the country after hours of last-minute negotiations with the leaders of Guinea and Mauritania, human rights activists demanded that he be held accountable for alleged abuses, including torture and detention of opponents. \u201cJammeh came as a pauper bearing guns. He should leave as a disrobed despot. The properties he seeks to protect belong to Gambians and Gambia, and he must not be allowed to take them with him. He must leave our country without conditionalities,\u201d said Jeggan Bahoum of the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy in Gambia. An online petition urged that Jammeh not be granted asylum and should instead be arrested. Barrow, though, cautioned that was premature. \u201cWe aren\u2019t talking about prosecution here, we are talking about getting a truth and reconciliation commission,\u201d Barrow told the AP. \u201cBefore you can act, you have to get the truth, to get the facts together.\u201d In recent days, Jammeh had been holed up in his official residence in Banjul, increasingly isolated as he was abandoned by his security forces and several Cabinet members. The West African regional bloc had pledged to remove Jammeh by force if he did not step down. The group assembled a multinational military force that rolled into Gambia on Thursday, after Barrow\u2019s inauguration and a unanimous vote by the U.N. Security Council supporting the regional efforts. The joint statement late Saturday announced a halt to the military operation in Gambia. But the force already in Banjul would stay to secure the capital before Barrow\u2019s arrival, Marcel Alain de Souza, chairman of the regional bloc, told reporters in Senegal. Gambia\u2019s unrest had more than 45,000 people fleeing the country, the United Nations said. But when Jammeh left, the deserted streets came back to life. Restaurants opened, music played and people danced in the streets. \u201cIt\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve in Gambia. We are just about to start a new democratic Gambia,\u201d said Momodou Janneh. \u201cFor the Gambia to truly move on, President Barrow must reside in State House and begin the task of governing,\u201d Jeffrey Smith, executive director of Vanguard Africa, wrote in an email. \u201cIn an ideal scenario, Jammeh will also face justice for the many crimes he has committed since 1994.\u201d\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.53583240509033, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 843, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.6386356538499998, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170122030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.15183867141162, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-un-pick-has-a-national-reputation-as-healer-in-chief/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 774, "scraper_regex": 834}}, "headline": "Trump's UN pick has a national reputation as healer-in-chief", "wordcount_as_scraped": 834, "date": "20161123220000", "story_content": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Gov. Nikki Haley has developed a national reputation as a racial conciliator who led the charge to bring down the Confederate flag at the Statehouse and guided South Carolina through one of its darkest moments, the massacre at a black church.\n\nNow the 44-year-old American-born daughter of Indian immigrants is about to take her role as the state\u2019s healer-in-chief to a world stage, as U.N. ambassador.\n\nOn Wednesday, Haley became the first woman and first minority chosen by President-elect Donald Trump for his Cabinet.\n\nIf the Senate confirms her, she could find herself in the awkward position of being the international voice for an administration that has belittled the United Nations, promised to build a wall along the Mexican border and endeared itself to the alt-right movement, even though Trump has repudiated such groups.\n\nHaley may have offered a glimpse Tuesday of how she will approach the job.\n\n\u201cFaith with action and kindness and love will always take us where we want to go,\u201d the Republican governor said at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, where a white man gunned down nine black parishioners in June 2015.\n\nHaley drew wide praise for her leadership after the attack, as she conveyed the state\u2019s grief and successfully led calls to bring down the Confederate flag that had flown on the Statehouse grounds for 54 years. The shootings were motivated by \u201cpure hate,\u201d she said then, and will \u201cforever change the way I live my life.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, churches across the state honored Haley\u2019s request for prayer vigils amid the nearly simultaneous murder trials of the defendant in the church massacre and a white former police officer accused of fatally shooting a black motorist in the back.\n\nHer handling of the racially charged events bolstered her national image, said longtime GOP operative Richard Quinn.\n\n\u201cIt became a national example of how you can deal with racial issues peacefully,\u201d he said.\n\nOther crises Haley has grappled with over the past two years include historic flooding in 2015, an elementary school shooting last September, Hurricane Matthew last month and wildfires that continue to rage in the state\u2019s northwestern corner.\n\n\u201cThe one constant is when things we didn\u2019t understand happened, the action was people stood hand in hand and loved each other. They didn\u2019t look for someone to blame, or hate. They looked for someone to love and lift people up,\u201d she said Tuesday, in calling for the same approach as the trials and the disaster recovery play out.\n\nBorn Nimrata Nikki Randhawa in rural Bamberg, South Carolina, Haley was raised a Sikh. She says she converted to Christianity before marrying her husband, Michael, in 1996. They have two children, ages 18 and 15.\n\nHaley has recalled that as a youngster, she and her sister were disqualified from the segregated Little Miss Bamberg Pageant because organizers couldn\u2019t figure out whether the girls should compete in the white or the black contest.\n\nShe confronted religious slurs over her Sikh roots during her 2010 campaign.\n\nThe second-term governor, who can\u2019t seek a third term, was a Trump critic during the White House campaign. She asked Americans to resist \u201cthe siren call of the angriest voices\u201d in how the nation treats immigrants.\n\nBut she has also fought the Obama administration on both legal and illegal immigration. Last December, she asked that no Syrian refugees be relocated to South Carolina because of \u201cgaps in available intelligence\u201d on those fleeing the civil war.\n\nHaley, the second U.S. governor of Indian heritage, is the first South Carolina governor who is not a white man. She is also the nation\u2019s youngest governor.\n\nShe brings limited international experience to one of the U.S. government\u2019s most important international assignments. Almost all of her exposure on the world stage has been in pursuit of luring jobs to South Carolina.\n\nMichelin, Bridgestone, Continental, Trelleborg and Giti Tire all have announced new or expanded operations in recent years, bolstering South Carolina\u2019s reputation as the nation\u2019s tire capital.\n\nHer trips abroad to lure jobs include a 2015 secretive trip to Sweden, which was followed weeks later by an announcement that Volvo would build its first U.S. auto plant in South Carolina in exchange for more than $200 million in state incentives.\n\nIn 2014, Haley took an economic development trip to India, her first visit to her parents\u2019 native country since she was 2. Her parents emigrated from India in the early 1960s.\n\nHaley graduated from Clemson University in 1994 with an accounting degree. But she says her business experience started at age 13, when she became the bookkeeper of her family\u2019s clothing store, a job she returned to after college.\n\nIn 2010, she was a three-term state House member, little known across the state. Still, Haley won the GOP primary for governor that year against a South Carolina congressman, an attorney general and a lieutenant governor. She prevailed in the general election and was easily re-elected four years later.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.74013924598694, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 774, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.98758403627, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "cbsnews.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161123220000, "PurityVirtue": 5, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.39276485788114, "C_SOURCE": 1}}}
