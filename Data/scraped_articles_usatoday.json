John Carney; Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons; and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester.\n\nLooking sharp and well-rested in a blue-and-white tie, Biden was penned in by Secret Service agents so he couldn't do his usual meet-and-greet on the train.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Biden expressed optimism over the changing of the guard, noting that the people won't easily relinquish hard-fought civil rights protections. He also noted that there is no inherent conflict between progressive ideology and that of working people.\n\n\"This is one of the great hallmarks of American democracy, and it was a peaceful transition of power,\" he said of the inauguration.\n\n\"I just think we've got to give this administration a chance,\" he said. After meeting with President Trump and Vice President Pence on foreign policy matters, Biden said: \"I know they know the subject, but they may not know the nuance.\"\n\nBiden said planned to spend the weekend with family, before returning to Washington to handle his post-VP business Monday.\n\nOn Inauguration Day, Biden left the vice presidential residence at the Naval Observatory for a spectacular homecoming. A public rally is scheduled Friday afternoon at the Chase Center on the Riverfront, with remarks by Carney, Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki and members of Delaware's congressional delegation.\n\nAt the head of the line, Tracey Vanderloo waited outside the Chase Center for three hours to get first access to the event. She said Biden is a \"bright spot\" in the nation's future and she looks forward to his work with the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Delaware.\n\n\"It's wonderful to have Joe Biden home,\" said Vanderloo.\n\n\"He's a giant among men. There'll never be anybody able to replace him,\" says Wilmington community leader Bernadette Winston.\n\nFor Biden, homecoming is a bit of a misnomer. The Washington insider always knew where his home was.\n\nVP Joe Biden, Sen.

Colin Powell.\n\nA buoyant septuagenarian, Biden has occupied the spotlight longer than Kanye West and Kim Kardashian have been alive. Now, opponents of Trump are looking to call on his working-class roots and trademark braggadocio to connect with the disaffected male voters who helped elect a self-described blue-collar billionaire.\n\nIn recent weeks, Biden has implored Trump to \"grow up\" and warned the commander-in-chief that his public frustration with the intelligence community could undermine national security.\n\nEarlier this month, Biden tweeted he would return to Wilmington on the train: \"Jan 20, Jill and I will head home to Delaware the same way I have for 44 years: by train. Serving this country has been our greatest honor.\"\n\nJan 20, Jill and I will head home to Delaware the same way I have for 44 years: by train.

Occasionally, the 7:30 a.m. Acela to Washington would experience \"mechanical delays\" so that Delaware's most famous resident had time to board after dropping the kids off at school.\n\n\"Amtrak Joe's\" round trips, totaling roughly 8,000 over his 36-year Senate career, basically ended when he assumed the vice presidency. In 2009, Biden, in a nod to Abraham Lincoln, hopped the train to D.C. with then-president-elect Barack Obama three days before they took the oath of office. Lincoln similarly traveled by rail to the capital before his inauguration in 1861.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, Wilmington station was officially renamed the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station. Last year, Biden announced a $2.45 billion loan to Amtrak from the Department of Transportation, the largest loan in the department's history.\n\nThe Bidens plan to find a small house in Washington to remain close to the Obamas and to Jill Biden's teaching job at a community college in northern Virginia, according to The New York Times.\n\nBut then it's back to work for the elder statesman, partnering with the University of Delaware on domestic and economic policy issues and the University of Pennsylvania on foreign policy matters. In between, he'll attempt to find a cure for cancer through the \"cancer moonshot\" initiative he's spearheading.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.22805017232894897, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 767, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.5089442791400005, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170120200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.60756192959583, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/13/digging-dirt-so-common-russia-theres-even-word/96536252/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 900, "scraper_regex": 837}}, "headline": "Digging dirt so common in Russia, there's even a word for it \u2014 'kompromat'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 837, "date": "20170113170000", "story_content": "President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov called on journalists Friday to stop discussing an unsubstantiated dossier, claiming Russians had dirt on Donald Trump.\n\nThe dossier, initially posted online by Buzzfeed, claims that Russia has compromising information on the U.S. president-elect, including, among other things, a variety of sexual and financial allegations.\n\nThe unverified report, purportedly prepared by a former British intelligence agent hired by Trump's political opponents, has been roundly denounced by Trump, who tweeted on Friday: \"Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 FAKE NEWS! Russia says nothing exists...\"\n\nTotally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans - FAKE NEWS! Russia says nothing exists. Probably...\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2017\n\nThe Trump allegations aside, the Russian intelligence, service known as the FSB, regularly traffics in compromising material, Gennady Gudkov, a retired FSB colonel and a former opposition parliamentarian, told USA Today.\n\n\"Say a person stayed at a room in a hotel that was already bugged and started doing things he shouldn't be doing. And then it turns out the person was famous. It's a matter of luck for (the security services), and material like this can surface on anyone,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't even have to be a person of interest. They just gather everything like a vacuum cleaner and then see what they can use.\"\n\nRussia's government, meanwhile, has persistently denied using such tactics. \"Pulp fiction,\" Peskov said earlier this week about the allegations involving Trump.\n\nGiven the opportunistic tendencies of the Russian security services, just how paranoid should business people or tourists traveling here be?\n\n\"The moral of the story is don't book the most expensive rooms and suites \u2014 which are most likely to be used by the rich and powerful \u2014 if you want discretion,\" said Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian security at the Institute of International Relations in Prague in the Czech Republic.\n\n\"Seriously, the FSB hardly monitors foreigners with quite the same profligate enthusiasm as the KGB, but it will make an exception for powerful and influential people. I'm not convinced they would have regarded Trump as worth watching in the earlier years, but he may well have put himself in the spotlight simply by his high-doling habits.\"\n\nThe more pervasive practice is gathering dirt as a means of internal repression \u2014 and a number of opposition figures have borne the brunt of deliberately-orchestrated sex scandals.\n\nIn 1999, a sex video featuring someone who looked like the then-prosecutor general, Yuri Skuratov, and two prostitutes was aired on national television. It came shortly after Skuratov launched a number of corruption probes. against officials in then-president Boris Yeltsin's government.\n\nThe scandal ended when Skuratov was dismissed the following year amid pressure from the newly-elected Putin, who had been head of the FSB when the videotape emerged.\n\nIn 2010, Ilya Yashin, a prominent opposition leader, said he wasn't too surprised when a girl he had been dating for a few weeks turned out to be a honey trap.\n\n\"It was a surprise when she invited me to her apartment and there was [another girl] and they both dragged me to bed,\" he wrote of the incident on his blog. \"I would be lying if I said I resisted.\"\n\nYashin knew something was afoot when Katya Gerasimova, his girlfriend, brought out a bunch of sex toys.\n\n\"That was the first time I thought it was a provocation. 'Should I smile? Are we being filmed by a hidden camera?'\" he wrote.\n\nThey were being recorded and Yashin became one of a number of opposition figures \u2014 including the liberal Viktor Shenderovich and the nationalist Eduard Limonov \u2014 who were shown on national television having sex. The same woman \u2014 Gerasimova \u2014 featured in all the videos.\n\n\"Our security services are using these tactics to discredit government opponents,\" Gudkov said. He added that methods that are supposed to be used to protect the government from its \"foreign enemies\" are being turned on its own citizens.\n\n\"This surveillance is in violation of the constitution. This information is then given to certain media outlets and then the rumor mill starts,\" he said.\n\nEven if the \"dirt\" is innocuous, as it was with Yashin, the way the information is spun causes popularity ratings of the politicians involved to plummet, Gudkov said.\n\nLast April, Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime minister and leader of the liberal People's Freedom Party (PARNAS), was shown by the pro-Kremlin NTV channel having sex in a hotel room just as his party was preparing regional campaigns for parliamentary elections.\n\nThe video sought to expose not just the sex (Kasyanov is married), but his conversations with his partner Natalia Pelevina, an opposition activist, in which they plotted building a front against fellow oppositionist, Alexei Navalny.\n\n\"As a result of this propaganda, the opposition's negative rating is higher than its positive rating,\" Gudkov said. \"This is reflected in the political campaigns.\"\n\nWhile gathering dirt may be a staple of intelligence agencies everywhere, its aggressive use in Russia has been taken to a new level.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.34645676612854, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 900, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 5, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.0489868490200003, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.77777777777778, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/11/09/why-women-making-gynecologist-appointments-post-election/93553266/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 687, "scraper_regex": 885}}, "headline": "Why women are making gynecologist appointments post-election", "wordcount_as_scraped": 885, "date": "20161110000000", "story_content": "Get your feet in the gynecologist's stirrups \u2014 now. \"You have 70 days.\" That's the message women are sending each other online after Tuesday's presidential election.\n\nHere's why: Under Obamacare, women have access to 18 FDA-approved types of birth control at no out-of-pocket cost. It is unclear if the availability and cost of birth control will change after the new administration settles into the White House. But women are taking to social media to voice their fear that under a Trump presidency, birth control costs will go up and access to services like Planned Parenthood will be limited. Planned Parenthood serves 2.5 million people annually, offering birth control and services including STD testing, cancer screenings, counseling, pap smears and abortions.\n\nLadies make sure you stock up on birth control, free condoms and take advantage of free STD testing while Planned Parenthood still exists\u2014 Samantha (@SammanthaKellyy) November 9, 2016\n\nIm about to stock up on 4 years worth of birth control cuz I aint riskin my healthcare rights\u2014 Tia (@tia_malise6) November 9, 2016\n\nThe fear stems from the Republican party's push to repeal Obamacare and Trump campaign's alignment with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who as governor of Indiana championed a bill to block federal funds from Planned Parenthood, and later fought to pass a law restricting abortions in what was considered an already restrictive state.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump said he would not fund Planned Parenthood while he's president, \"as long as you have the abortion going on.\" In a letter to pro-life leaders, Trump wrote that he would take several steps to restrict abortions and funding to organizations that provide abortion services. He also wrote that he was committed to nominating pro-life justices to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, Ginny Ehrlich, CEO of The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy says there is widespread support nationwide for birth control. A recent study by the organization shows 81% agree that those who oppose abortion should strongly support birth control \u2014 74% of Republicans and 86% of Democrats.\n\n\"The vast majority of the public across political parties, across demographic groups and across religious identities support birth control access for women,\" Ehrlich says. \"There is a public will around this issue and it's not a wedge issue.\"\n\nBut cost and coverage matter. Ehrlich says more than 20 million women across the country have access to publicly-funded contraception. \"Coverage matters. It matters a lot,\" Ehrlich says. \"It's no secret that we've seen unprecedented declines in teen pregnancy and birth rates, and in unplanned birth rates across all age groups and coverage is a big part of that.\"\n\nGet your IUD. If you have light periods, opt for a Paragard, which can last 10-12 years. Get your birth control that will outlast Trump.\u2014 grimalkin (@grimalkinrn) November 9, 2016\n\nIn fear of what might come after Jan. 20 \u2014 Inauguration Day \u2014 women are encouraging each other to learn more about one birth control method in particular: an intrauterine device or IUD.\n\nIt's a T-shaped piece of plastic or copper that is placed in a women's uterus to prevent pregnancy and can last between three and 12 years \u2014 which in most cases, women are noting, would outlast a four-year presidential term. Once an IUD is implanted, there is no additional cost or maintenance, except for removal or complications.\n\nThe IUD consultation, device and insertion can cost up to $1,000 without insurance. Under the Affordable Care Act, many women were able to get an IUD heavily subsidized or free. The birth control pill can cost an uninsured woman up to $50 a month, according to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"It's a significant cost every month that, if not covered, adds up \u2014 especially for women that are living on a fixed income,\" Ehrlich says.\n\nWomen: look into getting an IUD in the next 3 months. You may not be able to get affordable birth control next year and IUDs last min 3 yrs\u2014 Brooke Ballengee (@brookeballengee) November 9, 2016\n\nBut women likely can't just go to the doctor and ask for a presidential term's worth of birth control. \"It depends on what state you live in,\" Ehrlich says. \"There are some states that allow women to get a year of pills, in other states it's discretionary.\"\n\nEhrlich says there is not a one-size-fits-all method for birth control, and to be safe, women need access to information and all of their options. \"If we think about this as a basic health care issue for women, we have to ensure that women really have full access to the full range of methods available.\"\n\nIf you want a birth control method that will last you four years, an IUD is your best bet, she says.\n\nFor Ehrlich, the post-election frenzy around birth control is not all negative. \"The silver lining here is that everybody loves birth control,\" she says. \"The fact that women are focusing on this issue the day after the election \u2014 it shows that this matters.\"\n\nRemember @PPact bills on a sliding scale if you don't have insurance.

Last year's numbers have not yet been released.\n\nAttacks on refugees and refugee shelters have increased nearly fivefold since 2014, according to Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office. For 2016, 921 attacks were recorded, up from 199 in 2014, the police office said.\n\nBut Richter argued the evidence shown in court failed to connect the NPD to recent anti-immigrant attacks. Some critics of the party agreed.\n\n\"That violence was never committed by the NPD \u2014 they always knew that would be a danger to the party's existence,\" said Timo Reinfrank, head of the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, an organization that fights right-wing violence in Berlin.\n\nInstead, these attacks are linked to supporters of anti-immigrant groups like the grass-roots PEGIDA (Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West), and the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party, Reinfrank said. Both groups have distanced themselves from the NPD's neo-Nazi ideology.\n\nReinfrank also said the NPD's declining membership, vacant leadership positions and recent electoral losses suggest the party isn't powerful enough to merit a ban by the court, a move that could make martyrs out of the party's diehards.\n\n\"The NPD was thrown out of its last state legislature in elections in the state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania last year,\" Reinfrank said. \"Now I don't see a reason to ban the NPD. It has no importance anymore.\"\n\nChristian Kirchberg, a constitutional lawyer in Karlsruhe, said German history might be a factor in the court's decision, despite the NPD's marginal role in politics.\n\n\"Germany could be justified in reacting decisively and timely against a revival of national socialist or 'v\u00f6lkisch' ideologies,\" said Kirchberg, using a German term for racist nationalism.\n\nRichter said the proposed ban was an attempt by Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government to look tough on neo-Nazis after failing to stop a series of killings committed by a right-wing terrorist group, the National Socialist Underground (NSU) in the mid-2000s.\n\nGerman police originally blamed the deaths \u2014 dubbed the \"Kebab Killings\" \u2014 on the Turkish mafia because many victims were of Turkish origin. But the discovery of the NSU in 2011 became an embarrassing scandal for Merkel after an investigation found that German police had connections to the group.\n\nA clear connection between the NPD and NSU has never been found.\n\nEven if the Constitutional Court does ban the NPD, Richter said the party plans to appeal at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, which has overturned bans on other political parties.\n\n\"The European Court upholds a clear criteria for a ban \u2014 that a party has to demonstrate a degree of danger to the state,\" Richter said. \"That isn't evident here, so I'm confident a potential ban would fail\" in the Strasbourg court.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.12016725540161, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 825, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 15, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.70975776254, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170115210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.0, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/07/anchorage-police-investigated-fla-airport-shooting-suspect/96302054/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 907, "scraper_regex": 830}}, "headline": "Anchorage police investigated Fla. airport shooting suspect", "wordcount_as_scraped": 830, "date": "20170108020000", "story_content": "ANCHORAGE \u2014 Authorities in Alaska who last year referred for mental evaluation the man charged in the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting said Saturday he was allowed to retrieve his gun in early December.\n\nEsteban Santiago, who police say killed five people and wounded six others Friday in the shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, could not be denied his weapon because he was not declared \"adjudicated mentally ill,\" Alaska U.S. Attorney Karen Loeffler said during a news conference. Federal law prohibits the mentally ill from possessing weapons, but only if they've been formally declared adjudicated.\n\nSantiago approached the FBI office in Anchorage in what authorities described as a walk-in complaint to say he was \"having terroristic thoughts,\" according to descriptions of the incident by authorities at the time.\n\n\"During the interview, Mr. Santiago appeared agitated and incoherent, and made disjointed statements,\" FBI Anchorage Field Office Special Agent in Charge Martin Ritzman said. \"Although he stated he did not wish to harm anyone, as a result of his erratic behavior, our Joint Terrorism Task Force special agents contacted local authorities, who took custody of Santiago and transported him to a local medical facility for evaluation.\"\n\nSantiago had a loaded magazine cartridge with him at the time, although he did not bring a weapon with him into the FBI office, Anchorage Police Chief Christopher Tolley said.

He had broken no laws when he came into our office making disjointed comments about mind control,\" Ritzman said.\n\nAnchorage police responded to a series of calls about Santiago last year, Tolley said. He was arrested and charged with criminal mischief after police received a call about a physical disturbance in January. He was ordered as a condition of his release to stay away from his girlfriend and the apartment they lived in, but was arrested again in February when police found him there during a routine check, Tolley said.\n\nIn March, police received another physical disturbance call, but officers \"were not able to establish probable cause for an arrest\" of Santiago, Tolley said.\n\nPolice received another domestic violence call on Oct. 15 concerning Santiago, but officers were told by a municipal prosecutor not to arrest him, Tolley said. On Oct. 21, police received a call accusing Santiago of strangulation, but officers could not establish probable cause for an arrest, Tolley said.\n\nTolley did not identify who called police about Santiago or who accused him. Court records show Santiago's girlfriend was the victim in the January incident.\n\nLocal, state and federal authorities in Alaska have executed two search warrants for residences where Santiago has stayed, Ritzman said. There is no threat to the local community, he said.\n\n\"While we are early in this investigation, there is currently no indication Mr. Santiago was working with any other individuals when he planned and carried out yesterday's attack,\" Ritzman said.\n\nAuthorities in Florida investigating the shooting said Saturday they have not ruled out a terrorism motive. Santiago traveled from Anchorage to Fort Lauderdale to carry out the shooting, FBI officials said.\n\nRitzman said authorities could not comment on what mental-health facility released Santiago or what his diagnosis was prior to the airport shootings. Tolley said he had not confirmed that the weapon used in the airport shooting Friday was the same weapon retrieved by authorities after Santiago walked into the FBI office in November, but it was believed to be the same gun.\n\nResidents at the small apartment complex where Santiago lived said Saturday they didn't know him. He lived in a small half unit behind the complex. A mailbox listed his name, his girlfriend's name and another name.\n\nEric Brown was leaving his unit in the complex after warming up his car for 15 minutes in the sub-zero temperatures, just after the sun came up at about 10 a.m. Saturday. Brown said he didn't know Santiago and had never met his girlfriend. He said the small complex is made up of people who mostly keep to themselves.\n\n\"We all work odd hours here and don't see much of each other,\" Brown said.\n\nAlaska National Guard officials released more details Saturday of Santiago's service. He joined the Puerto Rico National Guard on Dec. 14, 2007. He was deployed to Iraq from April 23, 2010, to Feb. 19, 2011.\n\nHe later was in the Army Reserves prior to joining the Alaska Army National Guard on Nov. 21, 2014. He served as a combat engineer and received a general discharge as a private first class from the Alaska guard on Aug. 16 for unsatisfactory performance.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 23, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.09554147720337, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 907, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.84056930597, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 23, "mft_sum": 50, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170108020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.51267916207277, "mft_mean": 4.54545454545}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/11/07/unprecedented-act-china-bars-2-hong-kong-lawmakers/93412428/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 736, "scraper_regex": 548}}, "headline": "China bars 2 Hong Kong lawmakers in unprecedented act", "wordcount_as_scraped": 548, "date": "20161107110000", "story_content": "China took the unprecedented action Monday of barring two of Hong Kong's newly elected, pro-independence lawmakers from taking office.\n\nThe move by China's top legislative panel shows how the communist government wants to maintain control over Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous city, and could prompt more protests.\n\nMonday's ruling by the National People's Congress Standing Committee in Beijing blocks the two lawmakers \u2014 Sixtus Leung, 30, and Yau Wai-ching, 25 \u2014 from a second opportunity to take their oath of office.\n\nThey were elected to Hong Kong's Legislative Council in September, but when they took their oaths last month, they deviated from the script by using a derogatory pronunciation of China and making other disparaging gestures, including displaying a flag reading \"Hong Kong is not China.\"\n\nTheir oaths were declared invalid, and the council president scheduled a redo, prompting mayhem in the council's weekly sessions, the Associated Press reported. Hong Kong's special administrator, handpicked by Beijing, then stepped in to bar the two from taking the oath again until the government's legal challenge was settled.\n\nBeijing's top committee decided to act quickly, ruling on a section of Hong Kong's Basic Law, or mini-constitution, covering oaths taken by officials.\n\nIn the interpretation published Monday, the committee said talk of independence for Hong Kong is intended to \"divide the country\" and severely harms the country's unity, territorial sovereignty and national security.\n\nIt also said those who advocate for independence for Hong Kong are not only disqualified from an election and from assuming posts as lawmakers but should also be investigated for their legal obligations.\n\nMonday's action was the first time Beijing stepped in to block elected Hong Kong lawmakers from taking office. It's also the first time that Beijing has interpreted the Basic Law before a Hong Kong court has delivered a ruling, the AP reported.\n\nLeung and Yau represent a powerful push for freedom driven by Hong Kong's youth. Many of the pro-independence candidates took part in the Umbrella Revolution of 2014, when youthful protesters took to the streets to express anger over efforts by Beijing to pre-screen candidates for office in Hong Kong.\n\nVoters in Hong Kong further fueled the challenge to Beijing's authority in the September election, when pro-democracy candidates won about 40% of the legislature's 70 seats. That provided veto power over central government edicts.\n\n\"For the young people this is going to definitely create a backlash. This is going to further fuel the independence movement,\" Samson Yuen, a politics lecturer at the Open University of Hong Kong, told the AP.\n\nLi Fei, a deputy secretary general of the standing committee, denied that the central government was escalating its interference in Hong Kong's affairs.\n\nHe said the Basic Law stipulates that Beijing holds the legal power to make interpretations. He also warned that promoting independence was not a matter of freedom of speech.\n\n\"Breaking 'one-country two-systems' is violating the law, not voicing a political view,\" said Li, referring to a principle under which Beijing is supposed to let Hong Kong keep its capitalist economic and political system separate from mainland China's until 2047, the AP reported.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said the government will implement the committee's ruling, saying the two elected politicians had advocated independence for Hong Kong and insulted China with their words and actions.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.42804431915283, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 736, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.42234774445, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161107110000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 6, "pct_mft_words": 3.5326086956521703, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/27/trumps-high-energy-presidency-week-one/97137740/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00f1": [1723]}}, "headline": "Trump's 'high energy' presidency, week one", "wordcount_as_scraped": 668, "date": "20170127190000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump swooped into the presidency with a flurry of executive actions and saber-rattling that upended establishment thinking but also triggered uncertainty and in some cases, alarm, about what lies ahead in the next four years.\n\n\"High-energy, high-impact,\" senior aide Kellyanne Conway tweeted Friday. \"Washington still adjusting.\"\n\nIn seven days, Trump made clear that he intends to make good on his \"America First\" mantra and fulfill campaign pledges to the \"forgotten men and women\" who helped put him in office. He issued directives targeting manufacturing regulations, expediting permitting reviews \u2014 including for the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines \u2014 and officially withdrawing U.S. support for a Pacific trade deal negotiated by the Obama administration.\n\n\"We've been talking about this for a long time. A great thing for the American worker, what we just did,\" Trump said when he signed the memorandum Monday.\n\nHe also signed orders directing agencies to find ways to ease the burdens of the Affordable Care Act while awaiting a plan to repeal and replace the health care law, and to target illegal immigration, which he called a \"clear and present danger.\"\n\nExecutive orders\n\nIn a pair of executive orders Wednesday, he kick-started construction of the southern border wall, directed the hiring of 5,000 new border patrol agents and 10,000 immigration officers, and shutting off federal funds for so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to inform federal officials about undocumented immigrants in their custody.\n\nHow to pay for the wall, however, has so far tripped up the new administration. After Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto made clear his country will not pay for it and canceled a planned meeting with Trump, the White House said Trump would slap a 20% tax on imports from Mexico, but later said that was only one option as criticism mounted, including from Republicans in Congress.\n\n\"Border security yes, tariffs no,\" Sen.

Seemingly stung by losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, Trump promised a \"major investigation\" of voter fraud, and continued to proffer widely debunked assertions that millions voted illegally.\n\n\"You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states.

That fire has burned more than a month and is just 20 percent contained.\n\nA total of 74 aircraft, including Black Hawk helicopters and BAE tanker jets, have been used.\n\nThe Southern Coordination Center in Atlanta has overseen the fire response, coordinating efforts with a myriad of federal, state and local agencies and fire departments. The center's Dave Martin said he can't be sure if the extent of the fires is unprecedented, but it is the biggest he can remember.\n\n\"It has been quite a while since we had had this number of large fires at this many locations,\" he said. \"The last time it was comparable was in 2001 and even then it wasn't this busy.\"\n\nStates that have been dealing with fires are Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. The fires taken together are even starting to rival the mammoth blazes of the west. The Big Sur fire in late July burned around 132,000 acres.\n\nA severe drought that has gripped the South -- in some areas since spring -- has been the big catalyst.\n\n\"The lower humidity and significant lack of precipitation for more than three months have made a perfect environment for fires to spread,\" said the center's Adam Rondeau. \"It makes them faster and stronger.\"\n\nRondeau said there have been 50 major fires \u2013 fires that burn more than 100 acres.\n\nNo lives have been lost. Only minor injuries and minimum property damage have been reported, Martin said.\n\nSeveral structures have been damaged including one residence, a house near Trenton, Ga.\n\nHowever, the smoke, especially dense in the Tennessee Valley in cities like Knoxville and Chattanooga, has sent hundreds of people to emergency rooms with respiratory problems.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality Index has in the past few weeks occasionally placed affected cities in the red \"unhealthy\" level, an indication that \"everyone may begin to experience health effects.\"\n\nThe Appalachian Trail is closed in parts of Georgia and North Carolina. Campfires have been banned in the 655,598-acre Cherokee National Forest that straddles the North Carolina-Tennessee line with stretches both north and south of the Great Smoky Mountains National Forest, which is also closed to burning.\n\nAnd, the drought and forest fire situation could go on for months, experts say.\n\n\"The forecast for December, January and February show the odds of below-normal precipitation are high for the Southeast,\" said Matthew Rosencrans, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nMeanwhile, beef cattle aren't getting their hay in East Tennessee and cattlemen are selling off some stock. Farmers from the cotton fields of north Alabama to the tobacco farms of North Carolina are taking their hits.

She was 80, and had fought a long battle with diabetes.\n\nMoore was a leggy brunette dancer from Brooklyn. Her first TV job came soon after she graduated high school in 1955, when she played Happy Hotpoint, a dancing elf in an appliance commercial.\n\nThat same year, the aspiring actress, whose family had moved to Los Angeles, married 27-year-old Dick Meeker, a cranberry-products salesman. For Moore, the nuptials were a ticket out of an unhappy household with a devoutly Catholic father, an alcoholic mother and a neighbor who sexually abused her when she was young. Meeker and Moore's son Richie was born in 1956.\n\nIn 1961, Moore's career began to take off as she landed the role of Laura Petrie, the suburban New York wife of Van Dyke's Rob, a TV writer, You can still hear Moore's flustered, singsong voice saying, \"Oh, Rob!\"\n\nShe was only 23 when she landed the role, but she was the perfect foil for Van Dyke, and proved herself to be his comedic equal. The chemistry between them was perfect; America loved their believable and humorous portrayal of a married couple.\n\nAnd the show was a departure for sitcoms: Moore's trademark Capri pants and flats caused a stir in an era when other television housewives were still wearing dresses and heels.\n\nBut it was the situational comedy, the brainchild of series creator Carl Reiner, that made for such laughs, along with a cast that also included Morey Amsterdam (Buddy) and Rose Marie as Sally, Rob's colleagues.\n\nHer sitcom family included her friends at the WJM newsroom. Ed Asner played gruff news director Lou Grant, Gavin MacLeod was unflappable as the newswriter Murray Slaughter, Ted Knight was the blowhard anchorman Ted Baxter and Betty White played Sue Ann Nivens, the station's flirty \"Happy Homemaker.\" Neighbors in Richards' apartment building were Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) and Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman).\n\nThe final episode made history as it brought closure to the characters when they were all fired (except for Ted). The final scene: a big group hug, and Mary turning out the lights for the last time.\n\n\"It has surprised me year after year from the last episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show that it was revered and continues to be, but I think I've become used to it,\" Moore told The Toronto Star in 1997. \"I treasure the esteem with which the public holds Mary Richards \u2014 and Mary Tyler Moore, who helped create her. It's a great feeling.\"\n\nMoore never really found another hit show like that one, though Moore spawned several spinoffs, including Lou Grant, Rhoda and Phyllis.\n\nWhat followed in the years after were TV movies, including Heartsounds (1984), Finnegan Begin Again (1985), Gore Vidal's Lincoln, 1988 and Stolen Babies, a 1993 project for which she won another Emmy.\n\nTwo attempts to recapture her sitcom glory on CBS (Mary in 1985 and Annie McGuire in 1988) were unsuccessful. Viewers seemed unwilling to accept her in a comedy as anything other than a facet of Laura Petrie and Mary Richards.\n\nWhile onscreen she had found a way to play the happy housewife and mother, in real life her story was more soap opera than sitcom.\n\nAfter her early marriage to Meeker ended in 1961, she married NBC programmer Grant Tinker, and the two founded the successful MTM Enterprises in 1969. With that company, Tinker produced many memorable TV series through the years, including Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, The Bob Newhart Show and WKRP in Cincinnati.\n\nThey seemed quite the Hollywood TV couple and stayed together until splitting in 1981. (The company was sold in 1990). But later Moore would say that Tinker was more a father figure than a husband.\n\nIn 1983, Moore changed that behavior pattern and married Robert Levine, a cardiologist 18 years her junior.\n\nBattling what she called \"a social drinking habit,\" Moore entered the Betty Ford clinic in 1984. She was also diagnosed as having diabetes early in her life, and she was a longtime vegetarian and animal rights activist.\n\nShe had to cope with much tragedy in her personal life: the death of only son Richie at 24, in 1980 of a self-inflicted gunshot, and the death of her 21-year-old sister in 1978 from an overdose of drugs and alcohol.\n\nThrough the years she used her fame to help the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, and, as a devoted animal lover, she served on the boards of several animal welfare organizations, including the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n\nHer success on TV helped give her a platform for those causes.\n\nTV historian Tim Brooks once said, \"Mary Tyler Moore must be counted, along with Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett, as one of the great comediennes of American television.\"\n\nAlthough Moore sometimes seemed to wish she could separate herself from those two famous characters, she once said when she found herself unable to sleep, she would sometimes watch old episodes of The Dick Van Dyke Show or The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\n\n\"Without any trouble at all, I'll lose myself in the episodes,\" she said when she was in her 60s. \"It's been so long I can hardly remember what the plots were, so it's almost fresh to me. They're always so wise. They have a lesson, small ones and happy ones. They give you hope that there's a better future.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.6469038724899299, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1354, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.97926720149, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4771048744460902, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/nletter/short-list/2016/11/15/short-list-tuesday/93929980/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "The problem with Donald Trump's kids", "wordcount_as_scraped": 577, "date": "20161117060000", "story_content": "Donald Trump may have an ethics problem.

Chris Christie met with Trump in mid-afternoon. After the meeting at 4:30 p.m., the two shook hands, and in response to a question from pool reporters about how the meeting went, Trump said: \"Very well. Very good.\"\n\nWhen asked about how the meeting was, Christie said: \"Great.\"\n\nSunday's meetings were anything but great to the small band of protesters outside the golf club. The group was part of Action Together NJ in association with Pantsuit Nation New Jersey, which represents some individuals who, in the wake of the presidential election, decided to channel their disappointment over the election outcome into action, according to Amie Babischkin, group administrator. The group organized Sunday's March for Women to demonstrate support against the divisiveness represented by the upcoming administration and Trump, she said. The small rally was aimed at offering unity and solidarity for all regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity.\n\nThe protesters drew honks of supports from some motorists passing by on the rural two-lane roadway with homes set far off the road. One man driving a black Volkswagen was heard yelling out \"Trump rules\" as he drove past.\n\n\"I think it's important that we oppose Trump at every step, otherwise we normalize his position. One of his first selections was a white nationalist. Then he's got (U.S. Sen.) Jeff Sessions, who previously said that grabbing a woman by the pussy was not a sexual assault. So he's going to be the attorney general,\" said Otis.\n\nColleen Channer of Scotch Plains said Sessions also called a black congressman \"boy.\"\n\n\"Too racist to serve on the federal bench in 1986, but 2016, it's all good,\" said Otis, adding she wants Trump to see he does not have a mandate. \"He didn't win New Jersey. He didn't win Somerset County. Unfortunately, he did win suburban college white women, but not me. And I think it's important that we continue to make our voices heard.\"\n\nAmalia Duarte of Mendham said a lot of Facebook groups have popped up in the wake of the election results. She learned about Sunday's protest through one of the groups.\n\n\"I've been watching what's been happening in New York and other cities and this feels like something where I need to have my voice heard. What disturbs me about Mr. Trump is his rhetoric,\" she said. \"He talks about coming together and still is very divisive.\"\n\nDuarte said Trump started his campaign talking about immigrants as criminals and rapists, then make fun of (U.S. Sen.) John McCain, then made fun of a reporter with a disability, then said no more Muslims should come into the country.\n\nWhile people can have a difference of opinion and policy, she feels that Trump has crossed a line, and she wanted to connect with other people who feel the same way she does.\n\nPamela Brug of Westfield, who helped organize the event, said the protest was to show Trump women have something to say and they don't agree with what he stands for.\n\n\"Our voices need to be heard. We are not going away,\" she said, adding as an African American she wants to see more movement on issues related to racial injustice.\n\nFor Brug, Trump's decision to relocate the transition team to Bedminster indicated he was running away from the protests in New York City. She sees the golf course site being used more and more before he takes office.\n\nChris Piccone of Bedminster, and his daughter, Lena, 8, also participated in the protest.\n\n\"Trump has done nothing to calm the temperament of the nation,\" said Piccone, adding he wants his daughter to get involved at a young age and to see that her father is active in what concerns her.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 25, "AuthorityVice": 5, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.20125794410706, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 854, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 7.010028235880001, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 25, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161121020000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.332552693208431, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/05/north-korea-nuclear-missile-trump-column/96205990/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 814, "scraper_regex": 754}}, "headline": "Trump should confront Kim over ICBM tests: Column", "wordcount_as_scraped": 754, "date": "20170105210000", "story_content": "One of the most critical foreign policy challenges President-elect Donald Trump will face in the early days of his administration is what to do about the nuclear saber rattling that continues to emanate from North Korea.\n\nRinging in 2017 with a New Year's Day address, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told the world that the year ahead would see North Korea test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), perhaps one capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.\n\nBecause North Korea denies most information to the outside world, no one knows for sure whether Kim's claim is true or whether North Korea possesses the technological know-how to launch a missile on a suborbital trajectory and have it return to Earth on target. Last year, it tested its intermediate-range missile and failed seven out of eight times.\n\nTrump has signaled that he has a plan, but it remains under wraps. He did tweet that \"North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!\"\n\nWhether successful or not, an ICBM test by North Korea would be very much against U.S. interests, and Trump should act to counter it as early as possible. A turn to the basics of deterrence would be the path most likely to succeed.\n\nFor deterrence to be effective, the United States should make it clear to North Korea and its autocratic 33-year-old leader that no benefits will flow from an ICBM test \u2014 that it will neither empower the regime nor advance its nuclear capability.\n\nWhen North Korea threatened ICBM development in 2006, former Defense secretary William Perry and Ashton Carter, who now holds the job, recommended that the United States destroy any test missile on its launch pad. That plan, however, was considered too escalatory and raised fears that North Korea might respond by firing artillery at U.S. allies in the region, such as South Korea or Japan.\n\nInstead, Trump could announce a plan to use U.S. missile defenses to shoot down any test ICBM after its launch. Shooting down North Korea's test vehicle would be a spectacular demonstration of the futility of the regime continuing to pursue its nuclear ambitions, and far less escalatory than dropping bombs on North Korea.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration could threaten to undermine the Kim regime's power through new information operations if North Korea tests an ICBM. Trump also could pressure China to intervene, though Presidents Obama and George W. Bush had similar hopes and China never delivered.\n\nTrump made clear his dissatisfaction with China's failure to intervene in a recent tweet: \"China has been taking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!\"\n\nBut China might be more willing to intercede with North Korea if it knows that the United States is prepared to take major action against the Kim regime to stop its testing of ICBMs.\n\nKim has parallel goals in pursuing nuclear weapons. One is to distract his people from the many economic and social failures of the Kim family regime by showing the world that North Korea is a nuclear peer of the United States. The other is to demonstrate his ability to strike the USA with nuclear weapons. He hopes to thereby coerce U.S. agreement to a peace treaty with North Korea to end the 1950s Korean War, which could lead to an eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea. Without U.S. forces in South Korea, Kim might be emboldened to pursue the only form of reunification he supports \u2014 North Korean conquest and absorption of South Korea.\n\nThough a test is merely a test, if Kim orders enough of them during 2017, the North could succeed in resolving the many problems its missile program has encountered. That's why a strong U.S. response is needed now.\n\nThere clearly are risks to any response that could provoke the mercurial Kim, but the risks of allowing North Korea to have a proven ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear payload are far greater. If even a single nuclear-armed North Korean ICBM were to strike a U.S. city, it could kill or seriously injure several hundred thousand Americans.\n\nTrump should be clear on how he would respond, not just to the threat of attack, but also to the tests that could make such an attack possible in the future. Kim should know that testing ICBMs will bring no benefits but will instead extract costs.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.09481811523438, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 814, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.6095818353499998, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.57985257985258, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/11/dylann-roof-sentencing/96460324/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "'Justice has been served,' families say to Dylann Roof", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1216, "date": "20170111230000", "story_content": "CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 To the convicted murderer who sat just feet in front of them, a few family members demanded he look at them, calling out with a sharp, \"Dylann Storm Roof!\" in frustration that he would not meet their eyes.\n\nOthers addressed the self-admitted white supremacist, one whose violence took the lives of nine African American parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church here, with a more familiar \"Dylann,\" in what felt like a subtle commentary on how he had become intertwined in so many lives.\n\nNot once did the 22-year-old turn his head. He did not look to see who called him evil or wished God might grant mercy on his soul or who wanted to recount the profound loss of a loved one.\n\nOn Wednesday, a day after a jury determined Roof should pay with his life for his June 17, 2015 attack, Judge Richard Gergel of U.S. District Court sentenced him following more than four hours of victim-impact statements from nearly three dozen people who in emotional statements spoke of grief, anger and love.\n\nGergel sentenced Roof to 18 death sentences and 15 life sentences, the statutory maximum for each of the 33 federal counts lodged against him.\n\nBefore Roof, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted of 30 counts of murder in 2015 for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that ultimately killed four victims, had been the most recent person convicted of federal capital crimes. Sixty-three people, all but one of them male, are now on Death Row in the federal system.\n\nAfter Gergel made his announcement, Roof asked the judge to replace his defense team as he begins his appeal.\n\n\"I just don't trust them,\" Roof said about the team of capital defenders that is widely regarded as among the best in the country.\n\nGergel denied the motion, saying his lawyers had been competent and loyal and zealously worked to defend him.\n\nBut the bulk of the day was devoted to hearing from those left behind after the shootings.\n\nDenise Dillegard Smalls, a niece of Roof's oldest victim, invoked the names of three relatives she lost, including Susie Jackson, 87; Tywanza Sanders, 26; and Ethel Lance, 70.\n\n\"All I want you to hear is \u2014 could you look at me?\" Dillegard Smalls said, interrupting herself as Roof refused to turn toward her. \"OK, I'm going to accept that.\n\n\"Understand at Susie's house, at Tywanza's house, at Ethel Lance's house, at all the nine houses, at Mother Emanuel's house, at the statehouse, at the White House, always remember justice has been served,\" Smalls said. \"Remember, what you got yesterday, you deserve it.\"\n\nThe morning began with Felicia Sanders, who survived the attack and shielded her 11-year-old granddaughter as Roof fired more than 70 gunshots around them.\n\nShe addressed him as Dylann Storm Roof, saying he deserved the respect that he did not show to her beloved Aunt Susie Jackson and son, Tywanza Sanders, whom she called \"my baby.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know you. You are in my head. I can't hear balloons pop. I can't see the fireworks. I can't hear an acorn fall out of a tree,\" Sanders said of the sounds.\n\nThen she talked about the moment when Roof pulled out his .45-caliber Glock as parishioners bowed their heads.\n\n\"Most important, I cannot shut my eyes to pray,\" she said. \"I have to keep my eye on everyone around me.\"\n\nForgiving Roof has been the easy part, Felicia Sanders said. She worries about the granddaughter she cares for who survived that horror and showed those in the courtroom her battered and torn Bible, the same one she carried to that Wednesday night Bible study.\n\nThe pages had been cleaned of blood, she said, but the words remained intact.\n\n\"You can't help someone who don't want to help themselves, and that is you,\" she said to Roof, adding, \"May God have mercy on your soul.\"\n\nFelicia Sanders' daughter, Shirrene Goss, told Roof that he neither started the race war he had wanted nor managed to rid the world of black people or any of the other groups he had maligned in his writings.\n\n\"You are going to realize you didn't have to do this, and it's going to bring you to your knees. You're going to ask \u2014 no you're going to have to beg \u2014 for mercy,\" she said. \"You deserved every bit of the sentence you received.\"\n\nThe Rev. Sharon Risher of Dallas, who lost her mother, Ethel Lance, and has advocated for gun reform since the attack on Mother Emanuel, told Roof that she had taken an unpopular stance on his punishment.\n\n\"Dylann, I was very vocal about you not getting the death penalty,\" Risher said.\n\n\"I still don't want you to die. I want you be to be able to sit in that cell,\" she said. \"You have made them martyrs. You have made them the face of America. You have opened doors and given me a platform I would have never had.\"\n\nShe said she would go to her grave illuminating the lives lost.\n\nOn the night of the shooting, Myra Thompson, 59, was leading the Bible study for the first time and took the small group through the parable of the sower from the Gospel of Mark 4:3-20 about seeds that are cast on fertile vs. barren soil. Like most of the slain, she was shot multiple times as she tried to take cover beneath folding tables.\n\nThompson's sister, Blondell Gadsen, told the court she continues to have questions about Roof but knows they will not be answered.\n\n\"I am so glad he's convicted and making us believe and know there's nothing mentally wrong with him,\" Gadsen said, referencing Roof's decision to serve as his own attorney. The move blocked his defense team from presenting mental health evidence. \"When you're heart is empty, there's no way to give and receive love.\"\n\nLike several other speakers, she thanked the court, jury and prosecutors for their service, comments that prompted the judge to note that he plans to release information related to two closed-door competency hearings regarding Roof.\n\nDefense lawyers had requested the hearings because of concerns that Roof was not able to represent himself.\n\n\"You will know that,\" Gergel said. \"You will get access to all of that.\"\n\nThe last person to speak was the Rev. Eric Manning, the present pastor of Mother Emanuel, which lost the Rev. Clementa Pinckney in the attack.\n\n\"For the past 19 months, Mother Emanuel has gone through its struggles its challenges,\" Manning told the court, saying that in the quiet of the lower-level room where so many lost their lives, parishioners can hear the echoes of the Holy Spirit. \"As we have tried our best to move forward, at times we have made several mistakes. At times we have questions.\"\n\nBut where some speakers called Roof evil, subhuman or an animal, Manning extended an olive branch, saying God still finds value in him, not for material things \"but because you are you. He would go any distance and pay any price just to possess you. In fact he did, not just for you but for all of us, when he gave his only begotten son.\"\n\n\"God still loves you,\" Manning said, addressing Roof directly. \"If you repent and seek his forgiveness, he will surely do that for you.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.3667621612548797, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1256, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.1465578727, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 4, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.70700636942675, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/25/donald-trump-sanctuary-cities-immigration/97043106/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "How Trump can defund 'sanctuary cities' protecting undocumented immigrants", "wordcount_as_scraped": 803, "date": "20170125190000", "story_content": "Trump vowed to \"crack down\" on those cities during a speech at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\"These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic,\" Trump's executive order said.\n\nA showdown between Trump and local governments over \"sanctuary cities\" likely will result in legal challenges testing how far the White House can go in dictating its priorities.\n\nTrump will be armed with a range of powerful options, including federal lawsuits and the power to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in grants that states and cities rely on.\n\n\"The Trump administration can largely get the results it is seeking and a real meaningful end to most of these sanctuary policies through a combination of carrots and sticks,\" said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, who has advised the Trump transition team on immigration enforcement options. \"The point is not to go around whacking all these little cities and counties, it's to get them to do the right thing. And for the die-hards, to confront them.\"\n\nLocal communities are digging in for a fight. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel created a task force to help undocumented immigrants and pledged $1 million for a legal defense fund. \"Chicago always will be a sanctuary city,\" he said.\n\nSome cities \u2014 including San Francisco, Chicago and New York \u2014 proudly declare themselves sanctuaries and have enacted policies that prohibit municipal employees from turning over residents or information on them to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nOther cities more narrowly restrict police from inquiring about the immigration status of detained suspects. There also are cities that work with federal immigration authorities but refuse to hold suspects in jail solely so ICE agents can pick them up.\n\nBeyond city governments, institutions that include churches and universities vow to fight federal efforts to round up undocumented immigrants on their grounds.\n\nHere are the two most powerful weapons the Trump administration will have to fight back:\n\nLAWSUITS\n\nIf Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., one of the most outspoken critics of illegal immigration, is confirmed as attorney general, he will be able to sue cities on the grounds they are violating federal law by refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement.\n\nTheresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said that kind of lawsuit fits Trump's \"big and showy style,\" but the law is murky.\n\nThe Justice Department under the Obama administration ruled last summer that local law enforcement agencies are required by federal law to at least share that information. However, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled in 2014 that local police departments are not required to hold undocumented immigrants for ICE.\n\n\"Justice could spend all of its time and resources going after these cases,\" Brown said.\n\nGRANT MONEY\n\nThe two most likely federal agencies that could cut off funding are Justice and Homeland Security. They provide grants for local law enforcement agencies to hire officers; bolster prosecutions, courts and jails; provide drug treatment, prepare for terrorist attacks, and assist crime victims and witnesses.\n\nThe Trump administration has the power to cut off much of that funding. For example, Justice's State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, or SCAAP, distributed $165 million in 2015 to local agencies that detained undocumented immigrants in its jails.\n\nLaurie Robinson, a former assistant attorney general under Presidents Clinton and Obama who headed the Office of Justice Programs, which oversees grants, said the statute implementing SCAAP gives an attorney general broad power to decide who gets money.\n\n\"They could cut off drug programs, domestic violence grants, violence against women grants,\" she said.\n\nOther grants won't be as easy to end. Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services program distributed $208 million in 2015 to local agencies. But that money is distributed using a formula established by Congress, meaning an attorney general can't revoke grants without lawmakers' approval.\n\n\"Unless Congress were to change something, the executive branch cannot really decide on its own to cut off a grant that is by statute designated to go to a local jurisdiction,\" said Robinson, now a criminology professor at George Mason University.\n\nHelp won't be hard to find. Republicans in Congress, including Rep. Duncan Hunter of California and Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, have tried in recent years to pass laws establishing those kinds of cuts, but they always faced a veto threat from Obama. Republicans filed similar bills this week, and those have a far better chance of becoming law now that Republicans control Congress and the White House.\n\nRosemary Jenks, director of government relations for NumbersUSA, which favors lower immigration levels, said it's impossible to know how nasty the fight will get over sanctuary cities given the raw emotions on both sides. \"I'm not going to rule anything out,\" she said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.5605289936065696, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 828, "FairnessVirtue": 6, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.14901900309, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 15, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 57, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.8840579710144905, "mft_mean": 5.18181818182}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/10/national-park-honoring-underground-railroad-heroine-harriet-tubman-made-official/96394704/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "National park honoring Underground Railroad heroine Harriet Tubman made official", "wordcount_as_scraped": 501, "date": "20170110190000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON -- Sites where Underground Railroad conductor Harriet Tubman lived and worshiped in Auburn, N.Y., officially became a national park on Tuesday, adding to growing recognition for the abolitionist and activist.\n\nThe Harriet Tubman National Park commemorates her post-Civil War advocacy for women's suffrage and other causes. It includes her residence, a home she helped establish for elderly and indigent African Americans, and the historic Thompson Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church and rectory, located near the cemetery where she is buried.\n\nA memorandum, signed by Interior Secretary Sally Jewell during a ceremony, established the park as the 414th unit in the National Park System.\n\n\"She's a true American hero because she didn't just secure the blessings of liberty for herself, she risked her life to secure it for others and passionately fought to change her country to secure it for everyone,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., during the ceremony with other New York lawmakers, community and church members.\n\nBorn on Maryland's Eastern Shore, Tubman was enslaved for 30 years before escaping in 1849 to Philadelphia. She then led hundreds of slaves to freedom in the North over a 10-year-period and became known as \"Moses\" by African American and white abolitionists.\n\nA sister site in Cambridge, Md. -- the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park -- became a national park in December 2014 and its visitors center is expected to open in March.\n\n\"I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger,\" she's been quoted as saying.\n\nTubman worked for the Union Army during the Civil War as a cook and nurse, and later as a scout and spy. After the war, she cared for patients at the Home for the Aged she helped establish and she became active in the women's suffrage movement. She spent the last 50 years of her life in Auburn where she died in 1913.\n\nHer legacy has received greater attention in recent years. In April, the U.S. Treasury Department announced a plan for Tubman to replace Andrew Jackson as the portrait on the $20 bill.\n\nJewell said she can \"hardly wait\" to go to the ATM and find Tubman's likeness on a $20.\n\n\"The country is taking steps, slowly but surely,\" she said.\n\nYvonne Baskerville, a lay leader in the A.M.E. Zion Church, said Tubman's recognition is \"long overdue.\"\n\n\"It's unfortunate because a lot of children don't even know the name 'Harriet Tubman,'\" she said.\n\nThe National Park Service is partnering with Harriet Tubman Home, Inc., and the A.M.E. Zion Church -- which owns some of the properties -- to operate the park. The Auburn site's designation as a national park follows a lengthy legislative effort, beginning in 2000 with a law authorizing a study of how to best preserve her legacy.\n\nAuburn resident Judith Bryant, Tubman's great-great-great grandniece, said she was thrilled to see the park finally come to fruition.\n\n\"I'm just happy that it got done on President Obama's watch,\" she said. \"It's truly significant for the country.\"\n\nFollow @ngaudiano on Twitter.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.49501657485962, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 527, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.09577689354, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 5, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.64136622390892, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2017/01/15/wolff-publishing-business-business/96552830/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Wolff: The publishing business is a business", "wordcount_as_scraped": 884, "date": "20170116010000", "story_content": "Simon & Schuster is publishing a book by Milo Yiannopoulos, the Breitbart News right-wing provocateur, and for that has been roundly cursed by liberals, and accordingly mounted a free speech defense.\n\nBuzzfeed published the dossier of unverified charges against soon-to-be President Trump and was roundly attacked by Trump partisans, and, as well left many journalists, to say the least, uncomfortable. The site took to the talk shows to makes its case for open information.\n\nIn a not unrelated development, Facebook, widely criticized for its willing, if unwitting, distribution of fake news, has announced new, if not particularly convincing, measures to develop ways to qualify its content.\n\nThe same question is at the heart of each of these media tempests: how much is a publisher responsible for what it publishes?\n\nThe traditional view, at least since publishing, in the late Victorian age, became a money-making and therefore respectable industry, is that if you publish it, you own it. You were not only legally responsible for it, but it firmly attached to your reputation. This led to protocols about editing, fact checking, and the development of a long cannon of journalism standards and ethics. It also led to the idea of publishing brands. What you published defined you in the community and in the marketplace.\n\nThe Yiannopoulos book is a particularly good example of the breakdown of this view. Book imprints were once the staunchest cultural gatekeepers, with issues of taste and sales closely twinned, and with the decision to publish resting, often, on a small group of editors, or even on a single shoulder. You knew who was responsible. But then a massive consolidation of the business occurred, mixing and mashing brands, and, with new financial dictates, in essence, commoditizing books.\n\nAny book that makes financial sense to publish, no matter its nature, will, practically speaking, be published by any publisher. Beyond a book's financial bona fides, there is no real vetting, or editing, or concerns about taste. Most of the book industry is now a business focused on creating products\u2014often novelty products connected to a celebrity\u2014for specific market segments. A new crop of conservative publishers were suddenly making lots of money publishing conservative books. Hence, every major publisher hurried to established its own conservative imprint \u2014 the Yiannopoulos book is published by Simon & Schuster's Threshold Editions\u2014often run by liberals. In a sense, this is an example of the media overcoming its bias. In another sense, it's purely cynical: we believe none of this, but the money's good.\n\nBuzzfeed when it launched in 2006, was an effort to use new technology to help harness certain digital behaviors and amass large amounts of traffic, algorithms combined with cat videos. In a positioning slight of hand, it added a news organization to burnish its brand and distinguish it from the lower-end content producers starting to fall out of favor with social media distributors, notably Facebook. But Buzzfeed News, while a change in brand, was not a change in Buzzfeed's business model: mass, undifferentiated, traffic.\n\nBuzzfeed's editor, Ben Smith, made a journalism argument for publishing the raw Trump dossier (CNN published a report on the dossier, but not the actual material). Information can't be controlled, he argued, therefore it is the responsibility of the media to contextualize it. But this was really a market argument: Buzzfeed, competing in a world where everything would be published anyway, only realized an advantage if it published the inevitable first.\n\nThere are many examples of this as a historic publishing approach\u2014pictures of Elvis in his coffin or Jackie in the nude come to mind. But the model was circumscribed by brand. What you published defined you and your value\u2014if you published tabloid stuff you were a tabloid, with clear market implications, not least of all among advertisers. Buzzfeed is in a more complex position: it must, to some extent, defend its publishing status for the sake of its blue chip investors, but at the same time its value is wholly related to its traffic\u2014its advertisers (many who, buying traffic through automated systems, don't know they are on Buzzfeed) care only about and pay only according to the traffic it delivers. Hence, Ben Smith became the tortured face of having to justify his immense traffic windfall.\n\nMaybe it is good that the publishing world still believes that there is a need for some kind of rationalization about what it publishes. Facebook certainly seems to think it has to come up with some system or procedure or technology or method by which it can more artfully justify a model in which it takes no real responsibility for its content.\n\nCertainly, there are countervailing and cautionary winds out there. Trump, for better or worse, is suggesting that the media ought to be more accountable. The shuttering of Gawker, the gossip site, following its loss of a privacy suit, directly challenges the digital conceit that all hurdles to publishing have flattened. This election year has roundly been a debate about accuracy and meaning\u2014and responsibility.\n\nAnd yet, business is business.\n\nIf publishing no longer works as a set of brands, as an act of identity, as a pursuit of an idea, as standing for something but is only about commodity, then the deluge has just begun. Then there is no publishing business.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.45989298820496, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 848, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.8272501129299998, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170116010000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.0047169811320797, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2017/01/13/hack-proof-your-life-5-key-steps-boost-your-safety-online/96222110/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [2461]}}, "headline": "Take these 5 steps to boost your safety online", "wordcount_as_scraped": 906, "date": "20170113170000", "story_content": "At this moment, someone wants your information.

But where do you start? Follow these five steps to boost your safety online instantly.\n\nI've heard it a million times: \"I know that I shouldn't use the same password at every site, but I do.\" or \"Every time I set a new password, I forget it.\"\n\nWell, get over it. Relying on a weak password is asking to be hacked. Your passwords are either your first line of defense against hackers, or they're an open window that lets them slip through. In cybersecurity, there is no middle ground.\n\nHow dangerous is it? A lowercase, six-character password takes a hacker around 10 minutes to hack. Add four more characters, and you extend the time of that heist by 45,000 years.\n\nReady to give your passwords the strength of Fort Knox? Here's a quick to-do:\n\nCreate a unique and complex password that isn't hard to remember. One trick is a \"passphrase,\" which is both a statement and a complex series of characters, cases, and numbers. Make a phrase that's specific to you like, \"MySonWasBornOnAug12!\"\n\nChange your password regularly, but not too often. I recommend that you change your password at least once every 12-month period. If one of the services you use is involved in a data breach, you'll want to update your password for that account.\n\nI wrote an entire tip about tools and tricks to remember hard-to-guess passwords.

Two-factor identification is a fancy name for adding another step to the login process. A login page may ask for your first car or your favorite food. The website might even send a text message with a special code, to make sure you are who you claim to be.\n\nTwo-factor identification adds an important layer of protection to your account. For hackers, the coup de grace is setting up instant alerts when your account is accessed from an unfamiliar device or location. Usually, this is you because you're logging into your email account from an internet caf\u00e9 in London, or you're checking your bank balance on a trusted friend's phone.\n\nOther times, it's a hacker who is trying to figure out your credentials. You will receive a notification by email or text saying that there was a login from an unrecognized machine or someone asked to reset your password. The login will not be authorized or the password reset without having the special code included in the email or text.\n\nIf you do nothing else on this list, click here for the steps to turn on two-factor authentication on Google, Facebook and other sites you use.\n\nYou've probably encountered this before. Some spammy message shows up in your inbox, allegedly send from your beloved Aunt Joan. Why does Aunt Joan want you to click on this strange-looking link? Why is she suddenly interested in giving you a limited-time discount on a Rolex watch? These messages are sure signs of a hacked account.\n\nThe rule of thumb is this: Old accounts contain more personal data than you realize, no matter how short-lived and no matter how long it's been abandoned. Have too many online accounts to remember them all? Click here for a site that provides you with the steps you need to close down the accounts you're no longer using.\n\nSometimes, you may want to delete accounts simply because you've lost trust in the company that's storing your private information. After reports of Yahoo's multiple data breaches, I recommend that you close your Yahoo account for Yahoo Mail and other related services such as Flickr, Tumblr, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Messenger, Yahoo Shopping, Yahoo Music, etc. Click here for a step-by-step guide for the steps you need to take right now if you're a Yahoo customer.\n\nNow you're on a mission to boost your security. But what about data that's already been stolen? How do you find out whether an account has already been broken into?\n\nAt least one trusted site is dedicated to precisely that: HaveIBeenPwned sifts through your accounts in search of security breaches. Just run your email address and username through the search field, and it will tell you if your login information has been linked to any past breaches.\n\n\"Encryption\" used to be a word reserved for international super-spies, but not anymore. What you're looking for is \"end-to-end encryption.\" This method scrambles your messages so that they can't be read if someone other than the intended recipient gets it.\n\nSignal Private Messenger One encrypts all messages end-to-end by default. The service also doesn't keep any user information, such as address books or messages, on its servers. It lets you use your existing phone number and contacts list.

It's standard policy for officers to patrol alone, police said, It's also standard policy not to get the dogs \u2014 which are trained for narcotics and bomb sniffing \u2014 out and to use them to control a subject.\n\nIt is unclear why Rose was in the area, which is off campus. Wayne State police are also sworn Detroit police officers and patrol the area around campus.\n\nPolice have not said if Rose was responding to a 911 call that the manager of a nearby apartment building said she had made. Betty Evans, manager of the Lincoln Apartments, said she had argued with a man on a bicycle, who didn't live there and called 911 when he wouldn't leave the area. She said she looked outside as an officer arrived to confront the man on the bike.\n\n\"He was outside, in front. The officer was trying to get his hands behind his back. We heard a shot and the officer went down, and we heard two more shots,\" Evans said.\n\nThe suspect is known to the Wayne State police and other area departments. In 2011, he was charged with two charges of felony assault involving a police officer, one causing injury, and pleaded guilty, resulting in a 53-day jail sentence, the records show. There also was an incident in 2014, Holt said, although he didn't have details of that.\n\nThe shooting is hitting the 65-member police department hard, university President M. Roy Wilson said at a press conference Wednesday. Many Wayne State officers, visibly shaken, gathered in the back and exchanged long hugs with each other at the press conference.\n\nRose was a 2010 graduate of Ferris State University and was one credit short of completing his master's degree in police administration at Wayne State. His first job was with the Richland police department in western Michigan.\n\nRose had worked and done and conducted training all over the state, Holt said. He was also heavily involved in organizing memorials for other slain police officers in the area. Members of many Detroit-area police departments showed up at the hospital following the shooting.\n\nPeople who live near the scene where Rose was shot said the suspect is a regular recipient of meals handed out three evenings per week from the I Am My Brothers Keeper Ministry about a block away.\n\n\"He's just eat his food and took off,\" said a man who identified himself as Angelo L. \"(He would) go outside, smoke a cigarette and just vanish. That was it, just like everybody else that comes down there to eat.\"\n\nHe said he'd seen the man in the area regularly for the past five to six years.\n\nAngelo L. said he was familiar with Rose, who would regularly speak with and help people in the neighborhood, and that he feels \"very, very bad for him.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.8978495597839395, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 680, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.44975744746, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161124000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.08823529411765, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/28/iran-retaliates-canada-opens-arms-after-trump-immigration-ban/97189224/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 513, "scraper_regex": 655}}, "headline": "Iran retaliates, Canada opens arms after Trump immigration ban", "wordcount_as_scraped": 655, "date": "20170128230000", "story_content": "World leaders reacted harshly Saturday to President Trump's executive order suspending immigration and visas for citizens from certain countries with majority Muslim populations.

Once the damaged sewer line dries out, officials can get inside the 11-foot pipe to determine what caused the sinkhole.\n\nMiller continued to urge 300,000 residents in 11 communities in the drainage district to restrict water usage so raw sewage does not have to be discharged into the Clinton River and basements don't back up, especially a problem during heavy rains.\n\nMiller and Jason Edberg, vice president of NTH Consultants Ltd. of Detroit, which was contracted to investigate the sinkhole and did the same for the 2004 sinkhole, said the cause of both sinkholes might be connected to holes bored in 1979 when the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department owned the line.\n\nMacomb County's public works department bought the line in 2009 and it was inspected in 2010, Miller said.\n\nIn 1978, a sewer line collapsed on 15 Mile between the two sinkhole sites when the city of Fraser tried to hook in, Miller and Edberg said. Eleven holes were bored in a segment of the line not used after the collapse, and a bypass line was created around the collapsed area.\n\nHowever, in 1979 during the follow-up investigation of that collapse, the contractor also bored two other holes in the sewer line outside the collapse area to determine how far the collapse spread.\n\nThe 2004 and 2016 sinkholes are located at the sites of those two holes, both of which are on a segment of the line that has been in service to carry sewage since the 1970s, Edberg said.\n\nAll of the holes were believed to be patched with grout, but the patches may have failed, allowing groundwater to get into the pipe, carry soil out and erode the soil under the sewer pipe, Edberg said. The holes may not have been visible to the naked eye because the line always contains about 3 feet of water.\n\nIf this collapse turns out to be similar to the one in 2004, officials will know how to fix the problem, Miller said. But it's possible they may never know for sure what caused the sinkhole.\n\nMacomb County Executive Mark Hackel said he is talking with other officials to determine how to help the affected families, including the possibility of buying the condemned homes.\n\nBills already are coming in, Miller said. Supervisors at the scene are keeping an electronic field book with time, material and equipment used.\n\nThe former GOP congresswoman was elected in November to the public works commissioner post \u2014 which covers Huron, Lapeer, Sanilac and St. Clair counties; northern Macomb County; and eastern Tuscola County \u2014 defeating a Democrat who had been in the position for 24 years. She officially took office Sunday and said she plans to contract with a company this month to do a forensic audit of the public works office accounts.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.15212535858154, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 805, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.28720949911, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.3602484472049703, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/11/fact-check-russian-hacking-report-election-trump/96461526/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1054, "scraper_regex": 698}}, "headline": "Fact check: Spinning the intel report on Russian hacking and the election", "wordcount_as_scraped": 698, "date": "20170111230000", "story_content": "Ever since U.S. intelligence agencies released a report on Russia's attempts to influence the U.S. presidential election, President-elect Donald Trump and his top aides have made false and misleading comments about the report's findings:\n\n\u2022 Kellyanne Conway, Trump's choice for White House counselor, falsely claimed that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper \"makes very clear that there was no impact on the election.\" Actually, Clapper said there was \"no way for us to gauge\" the impact of Russia's attempts to influence the election.\n\n\u2022 Similarly, K.T. McFarland, Trump's pick for deputy national security adviser, claimed that Clapper said \"that nothing the Russians did had any effect on the outcome [of the election].\" Again, that's not what Clapper said.\n\n\u2022 Trump himself tweeted that the intelligence community \"stated very strongly that there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results,\" because voting machines were not hacked. But the fact that no machines were hacked does not mean that the hacking did not affect the election results.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Jan. 6 released a declassified intelligence report that said \"Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.\" Among other things, the report said, Russian intelligence services gained access to Democratic National Committee computers for nearly a year, from July 2015 to June 2016, and released hacked material to WikiLeaks and other media outlets \"to help President-elect Trump's election chances.\"\n\nFrom the day the report first dropped, Trump and his supporters have hammered the misleading talking point that the report showed Russian tampering didn't affect the results of the election.\n\nOn Jan. 7, Trump tweeted that the report showed there was \"absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results.\"\n\nIntelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017\n\nThat point was taken up repeatedly by top Republicans on the Sunday talk shows. On CBS' Face the Nation on Jan. 8, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell argued that the Russian effects, \"really, in the end, made no difference \u2026 [T]here's no evidence whatsoever that it changed the outcome of the election.\"\n\nOn NBC's Meet the Press, Conway insisted the intelligence report showed Russian efforts to sway the election toward Trump \"did not succeed.\"\n\nNevertheless, Conway later in the same show made the same claim.\n\nShe is right about McCain, but wrong about Clapper. Here is the exchange between the Arizona senator and the director of national intelligence at the Jan. 5 Senate hearing.\n\nLater in the hearing, Clapper added that election analysis \"certainly isn't the purview of the U.S. intelligence community.\"\n\nThe report itself stated that the intelligence community \"did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcomes of the 2016 election.\"\n\nIn a Senate Select Intelligence Committee hearing on Jan. 10, Clapper reiterated that the report \"does not \u2014 repeat does not assess the impact of Russian activities on the actual outcome of the 2016 election or draw any conclusions in that regard one way or the other.\"\n\nBut Trump's team has continued with the inaccurate talking point.\n\nA Washington Post story on Jan. 10 quotes K.T. McFarland, Trump's pick for deputy national security adviser, saying that Clapper said \"that nothing the Russians did had any effect on the outcome [of the election].\"\n\nAgain, the intelligence report takes no position on whether the Russian hacks swayed voters to cast votes for Trump.\n\nWe certainly can't say whether the information revealed by WikiLeaks influenced voters. But prior to the election, Trump used the WikiLeaks documents as a campaign pitch. At campaign rallies, Trump repeatedly made reference to the leaked emails. He read excerpts from Hillary Clinton's paid speeches that were part of the hacked information and cited hacked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, twisting the facts about Clinton's speeches and making a false claim about Podesta's email.\n\nTrump is entitled to his opinion that the Russian influence campaign did not change the results of the election. But he and his aides can't say that that is the conclusion of Clapper and the intelligence community's report.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1054, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.74994562822, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.3719165085389, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/11/21/short-list-monday/94218458/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [4181]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 767, "scraper_regex": 727}}, "headline": "There is one way Trump is sticking with presidential tradition", "wordcount_as_scraped": 727, "date": "20161121230000", "story_content": "For the president-elect, the tweet goes on\n\nIf Twitter is any indicator, Donald Trump will be unlike any president the country has ever seen. Sure, Obama has a Twitter account, but it is a carefully curated White House tool. Trump's account has functioned as an angry stream of consciousness and as president-elect he isn't showing any signs of slowing down. His latest social media invectives were directed at the Broadway hit Hamilton and Saturday Night Live. He also created controversy with his initial presidential appointments \u2014 particularly Jeff Sessions and Steve Bannon \u2014 but there are indications he may be more moderate in his future appointments. One area where Trump plans to stick with tradition: He will be living in the White House, although Melania and Baron won't join him until after the end of the current school year. Of course, the White House move is still a couple months off; in the meantime, Trump is taking a break from the transition to enjoy Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\n'The uniform was the target'\n\nA manhunt was underway across Texas for the unidentified man who fatally shot a San Antonio police officer Sunday, a bloody day for police officers across the nation. On Sunday, three police officers were wounded and two suspects killed in shootings in St. Louis and Gladstone, Mo., and Sanibel, Fla. James Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, said four attacks on officers in one day is another alarming a sign of the times. Think back. In July, five officers were killed in Dallas by a heavily armed sniper who opened fire at a peaceful protest against police-involved shootings. In Baton Rouge less than two weeks later, three officers were killed and three others wounded in an ambush.\n\nPope says God's mercy can even 'wipe away' sin of abortion\n\nPope Francis announced he is extending the special permission he granted priests last year that allows them to absolve the \"grave sin\" of abortion. Although he condemned abortion because it \"puts an end to innocent human life,\" Francis added \"there is no sin that God's mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father.\" The pope made the announcement as the Holy Year of Mercy \u2014 a jubilee in which Catholics can obtain special indulgences, or remission for their sins \u2014 came to end. Since becoming pope, Francis has angered some conservative Catholics with his calls to make the church more inclusive on social issues, including greater toleration of non-traditional families and homosexuals.\n\nConfessed killer of Jacob Wetterling gets 20 years in porn case\n\nDanny Heinrich was sentenced to 20 years in prison for possessing child pornography, a crime that led to the discovery of remains of Jacob Wetterling, a boy he abducted and killed more than 27 years ago. Heinrich, 53, pleaded guilty to the child porn charge and admitted abducting and murdering Wetterling. As part of the plea agreement to the federal child porn charges, Heinrich will not be prosecuted for Wetterling's murder. That plea also included an admission by Heinrich that he kidnapped and sexually assaulted Jared Scheierl 10 months before the Wetterling abduction. The statute of limitations prevents any prosecution of Heinrich for that crime. In the Minneapolis court, Jacob's mother, Patty Wetterling, was the final speaker before Heinrich, telling him that he would not win, and that she will leave the negativity and fear in court. \"I won't wonder about you or waste a moment of time concerning myself from this day forward. And we're taking Jacob with us.\"\n\nWhat is going on with Kanye?\n\nNo one really knows. But Kanye West has canceled the rest of his Saint Pablo Tour after two controversial concerts. The first of which was on Thursday when he told concertgoers that he didn't vote in the presidential election, but he \"would've voted on Trump.\" He said Trump's campaign approach was \"absolutely genius,\" and confirmed that he was still considering a presidential run for 2020. On Saturday, at a concert he cut short, he ranted about Beyonc\u00e9, criticized Jay Z, Hillary Clinton, Mark Zuckerberg and radio stations, the latter for not giving air time to artists such as Frank Ocean and Kid Cudi, who joined him onstage.

Not only that, a wall would send a \"negative\" message that would undermine years of economic and diplomatic cooperation between the two countries that contrary to public perception has benefited both countries.\n\nThat cross-border relationship includes the creation of more than 100,000 jobs in Arizona.\n\n\"We have said time and again Mexico is not paying for the wall,\" Carlos Manuel Sada Solana, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., said Wednesday during a meeting with reporters and editors at The Arizona Republic, azcentral.com and La Voz.\n\n\"That is something that has been said several times by the president of Mexico, the secretary of foreign affairs, secretary of economy, the secretary of finance,\" he continued. \"So we are not paying for the wall.\"\n\nSada also balked at Trump's suggestion that he may try to force Mexico to pay for a border wall by taxing money transfers, called remittances, from workers in the U.S. to their families in Mexico.\n\nAttempting to tax remittances would raise \"legal issues\" that Mexico would fight, Sada said.\n\n\"There is also legal issues that are at stake, and if that is one of the alternatives, we will find out what we have to do in that case. But this is not a deliberate action for Mexico to pay for the wall,\" he said.\n\nSada also pointed out that fencing and other types of barriers already exist along 700 miles of the 2,000-mile-long border, including in Arizona. Building an actual wall could hurt the environment and curtail trade between the two countries.\n\n\"We fear that there is going to be consequences regarding environmental issues,\" he said. \"It's also going to be sending a very negative message. What we say is we like to build bridges.\"\n\nHe noted that 85% of trade between the U.S. and Mexico is trucked through 58 border crossing points. \"We need to do better on that.\"\n\nHe said he would prefer to see the U.S. pass immigration-reform legislation, which has been stalled in Congress for years.\n\nThat would allow Mexicans who come to the U.S. to work to enter legally rather than illegally, and therefore improve border security along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"It is in our interests to have a safe and efficient border,\" Sada said.\n\nSada, previously the consul general of Mexico in Los Angeles, was named Mexico's ambassador to the U.S. by Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in April to respond to Trump's negative portrayal of Mexico and Mexican immigrants.\n\n\"Mexico is not the enemy. It is the partner\" of the U.S., Sada said Wednesday.\n\nDuring his visit to Phoenix, part of a two-day trip to Arizona that included stops in Nogales and Tucson, Sada defended the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Trump has threatened to end the agreement, blaming it for the loss of manufacturing jobs in rust-belt states.\n\nOn Wednesday, Carrier Corp. announced that it had reached an agreement with Trump to keep about 1,000 jobs in Indianapolis instead of moving forward with plans to move all of its Indianapolis operations to Mexico.\n\nSada said the Mexican government is open to \"modernizing\" NAFTA. But he credited the agreement with creating 5 million to 6 million jobs in the U.S., including about 100,000 jobs in Arizona, due to exports to Mexico.\n\nMexican investment in Arizona has created another 10,000 jobs, he said.\n\n\"For us, it is important that it is well-understood the relationship between Mexico and the United States because we think there is a perception that does not always correspond to the reality,\" Sada said.\n\nHe pointed out that Mexico is Arizona's top trading partner. Mexico accounts for about 40% of the state's foreign trade, he said.\n\nUnder the 22-year-old NAFTA, trade between Mexico and the U.S. has grown from a \"very modest\" $80 billion to $360 billion, he said.\n\nAs an example, he pointed to Tuesday's announcement by California-based Lucid Motors to build a $700 million plant in Casa Grande to produce electric cars to compete with electric-vehicle maker Tesla. Parts for the new vehicles would be produced in Sonora, Mexico, and then shipped to the plant in Casa Grande.\n\n\"So it has been a remarkable success from the perspective of how things have been evolving and this is something we have built together,\" Soda said, referring to NAFTA.\n\n\"We are not just buying and selling, we are producing together.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.585480093955994, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 767, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.16661368869, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161201040000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.1290743155149903, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/23/trump-election-womens-march-protest-riots-inauguration-reynolds-column/96923492/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Elections matter too much: Glenn Reynolds", "wordcount_as_scraped": 817, "date": "20170123210000", "story_content": "One of the most striking things about Donald Trump's accession to the presidency has been the over-the-top reaction of his opponents. One would need a heart of stone not to laugh at some of the expressions of dismay exhibited by Democrats, such as the now-famous protester who simply screamed \"Noooo!\" as the oath was taken, or Madonna saying she \"thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.\"\n\nBut in fact, this reaction to an election loss \u2014 by anyone, to any candidate \u2014 is not entirely irrational. Elections matter, after all. In fact, these days they matter too much. In the wake of the 2008 election, writer Jerry Pournelle observed: \"We have always known that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom. It's worse now, because capture of government is so much more important than it once was. There was a time when there was enough freedom that it hardly mattered which brand of crooks ran government. That has not been true for a long time \u2014 not during most of your lifetimes, and for much of mine \u2014 and it will probably never be true again.\"\n\nIn other words, if Americans increasingly find it intolerable that their political opponents control the government, that's because government controls too much.\n\nThen, of course, there was the weaponization of the IRS. When it was Tea Party groups being harassed, nobody cared much. But now Democrats fear that under Trump, the IRS might target them. And they should: Going back at least as far as FDR, as Jonah Goldberg noted in his book, Liberal Fascism, presidents have used the IRS and other parts of the bureaucracy to target opponents.\n\nBut now, of course, we've just finished eight years of a president who claimed the legal right to kill Americans, without a trial, anywhere in the world outside the United States. One who spied on journalists, and imprisoned those who leaked to them. One who openly boasted that with his pen and a phone he didn't need Congress.\n\nAnd that was fine with Democrats, until the other team took power. Then, as libertarian Bretigne Shaffer notes, everything changed: \"I understand that a lot of people are worried, upset, even frightened over the prospect of a Trump presidency. Good. They should be. But they should have been worried eight years ago, or at the very least, four years ago. . . . It cannot be that all of these people only see evil when it wears the other team's uniform. It cannot be that they are more upset by offensive speech than by a man claiming the right to kill any human being on earth at his whim. These things simply cannot be. And yet it sure looks like they are.\"\n\nWell, I'm certain that, as my old law prof Stephen Carter has predicted, with Trump in power \"the left will swiftly rediscover the virtues of limited government and, in particular, strong constitutional restrictions on the independent exercise of authority by the executive. In a further turnaround, the left will celebrate corporate power as a check on government.\" But the truth is, no president should have as much power as presidents enjoy now.\n\nThe trouble is, if people only support restraints on government when they're out of power, those restraints will never happen, since \"out of power\" means, well, out of power. So I have a proposal.\n\nLet those Democrats unhappy with the power possessed by Trump get together with those Republicans who were unhappy with how much power was possessed by Barack Obama and propose some real limits. Since they have to be limits that will apply no matter who is in power, they have to be limits that can't be overturned by an election: Constitutional limitations. We need amendments to the Constitution that will reduce the power of the government back to the point where, as Pournelle remembers, it doesn't matter much which gang of crooks is running things. Maybe we should have a constitutional convention to discuss them.\n\nAs a libertarian myself, I'd strongly support such limits no matter who is in power. I hope that the Democrats \u2014 who are now worried \u2014 and the Republicans \u2014 who've been talking about smaller government for as long as I've been alive \u2014 will support them too.\n\nAnd for anyone who doesn't want to limit the power of the government over its citizens? That will make clear that their only real worry is that their own \"gang of crooks\" isn't in power.

Every Nov. 1-2, his family would visit the cemetery where his relatives were buried. They would clean the tombs, making them look as good as new. There would be music, tequila and mezcal. And food, lots of food.\n\n\"It was a party,\" says Garcia, who lives in the Ahwatukee Foothills neighborhood. \"Everybody in town would come to the cemetery to spend time with the dead. I remember meeting and seeing all of my friends at the cemetery on that day. It was like a celebration of life.\"\n\nAnd, he stresses, there was never any fear.\n\n\"Part of our tradition in Mexico is to not be scared of death and to smile at it. It's a celebration of our ancestors as they were when they were on this earth, alive. It was never a sad thing or a scary thing.\"\n\nDay of the Dead survives, celebrates life\n\nLike the memory of a loved one that never fades, Dia de Los Muertos also survives. It may change and evolve, but it never vanishes. The Spaniards learned that when they arrived in central Mexico in the 16th century. They viewed the ritual, which was started by the Aztecs some 3,000-years-ago, as sacrilegious. But the festival couldn't be quashed.\n\nNot only did it survive, it thrived, moving from southern Mexico and spreading north. It also merged with elements of Christianity. Originally celebrated in the summer, it moved to Nov. 1 and 2 to coincide with All Saints Days and All Souls Day.\n\nDay of the Dead is still celebrated throughout Mexico and has even gone Hollywood: Daniel Craig's James Bond pursued a baddie through Mexico City during a massive Day of the Dead carnival in 2015's Spectre. The 2014 film The Book of Life features a Day of the Dead theme and animation filled with calacas (skeletons) and calaveras (skulls).\n\nIt has also moved to certain regions of the United States. In Arizona, for example, there are more than a dozen events that mark the occasion to honor the dead.\n\n \n\nAt the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, their annual celebration has turned into one of the organization's signature events. There is an exhibition of ofrendas, or offerings to the deceased on altars, as well as music, storytelling and a procession.\n\nKen Schutz, executive director at the garden, said their event \u2014 now in its 13th year \u2014 has grown annually, something he sees as a natural progression.\n\n\"Nationally, you hear more and more about Day of the Dead,\" he says. \"Our country and our state is becoming more multicultural, and it's higher on everyone's radar. It's becoming part of the national consciousness.\"\n\nThe garden designed its festival to appeal to people who connect with the spiritual aspect as well as those who are more into the playful aesthetic of sugar skulls and dancing skeletons.\n\n\"That's important for me on a deep level,\" Schutz says. \"People can plug in in different ways. For some folks, it's a party. That's true in Mexico, and that's true here. But for the indigenous communities, it's a very important holiday, and we try to stay true to that spirit.\"\n\nSchutz has experienced the power of Day of the Dead first-hand. Several years ago, he spent a week in Oaxaca in southern Mexico during the annual celebration.\n\n'A profound experience'\n\n\"It's a profound experience,\" Schutz says. \"It can be shocking at first, when you go beyond the color and look at the deeper meaning. It was a time of happiness, a time of cooking. There was lots of decorating and bringing colors and flowers into the home. Families would come together to prepare an altar.\"\n\nLike Garcia, he went to a cemetery at night. And, like most people born and raised with an American sensibility, it was initially an unsettling concept.\n\n\"To me, it was the most culturally unfamiliar part of the experience: To sit in a cemetery all night with a mariachi band and a picnic basket at the graveside. The whole thing \u2014 it's a whole different way to look at what it means to be alive. It was life-changing for me. I think that's one of the beautiful things about living in a multicultural society: You have the privilege of seeing and sharing perspectives with other cultures.\"\n\nOliverio Balcells, who originally is from Guadalajara, Jalisco, is very familiar with the tradition. As a child, he grew up in a \"very Christian-Catholic\" home, he says, and Day of the Dead was a regular part. There would be trips to the cemetery. In school, children would create skeleton-themed crafts to prepare for the holiday.\n\nNow, however, \"I don't really follow with the religion anymore,\" the Tempe man says with a chuckle. \"I just explain to my kids: I don't go to church or to cemeteries anymore.\"\n\nTribute to loved ones\n\nBut Day of the Dead is a key part of the art he creates. He has made ofrendas for years. This year, he has a display at the garden of a spectacular ofrenda that stands 6-feet. Dominated by black and vibrant purples, it features a large butterfly and a symbol of a cocoon. In Mexico, monarch butterflies appear in November, and many believe they carry the souls of ancestors.\n\nBalcells laughs when he says it's not obvious what was on his mind when he created the ofrenda. But his mother, Marta Delgado, died last year. The altar is a tribute to her.\n\n\"You wish this person was here with you,\" he says. \"You want to remember this person, and that's why you do it.\"\n\nMaking the piece was \"difficult,\" he says. \"I could not keep my emotions separate. Making an ofrenda is not something that is going to cure you of that feeling of sadness. But the feelings and the memories and all those things? When you finish, and you say, 'It's done,' and you know the purpose and meaning behind it, it's good to have this expression. And that helps you cope with the other parts.\"\n\nAs Day of the Dead has expanded, there could be some fear that certain aspects \u2014 the spirituality, in particular \u2014 could get lost. Marco Albarran, an exhibit developer at Arizona State University, says evolution is natural.\n\nStill a spiritual holiday?\n\n\"Here in the United States, they're just trying to connect to something,\" he says. \"All humans celebrate something that is very similar, but everybody in each place has their own kind of twist, so it becomes more a humanistic celebration than a specifically Mexican one.\"\n\nStill, there are some elements that bother him about the commercialization of the days.\n\n\"Just go to the 99 cents store,\" he says. \"You're going to see Dia de Los Muertos mixed in with Halloween. And then you go to a festival, and you look at Dia de Los Muertos art and it's made in China? That's not right.\"\n\nHe says he will hear people criticize certain Dia de Los Muertos celebrations, saying they're not traditional.\n\n\"But even what people perceive as traditional isn't traditional,\" he says. \"I came from a family that was very traditional, and when we came to the border (in Sonora), that tradition still continued, but not as strong. It became very weak.\n\n\"Here, it's almost kind of lost. It's hard to connect with family the way we did when we were young, because everybody's doing different things. If it wasn't for Facebook, I don't know what we'd do.\"\n\nGarcia knows that feeling. When he came to the United States, annual visits to cemeteries stopped. After all, he had no relatives buried here. He might go with friends, but it wasn't the same thing.\n\nKeeping tradition\n\nBut now that his daughter, Frida, is 6 years old, he and his wife, Briseida Silva, have decided she can be introduced to the meaning behind the art that he does.\n\n\"I've been waiting for this moment so we can teach her about Dia de los Muertos,\" he says. \"At an earlier age, they don't understand it completely. Now, she has her own opinions, her own understanding of the celebration. She can understand it, and she doesn't think it's boring. For us, it's as important as teaching her Spanish.\"\n\nThey talk about the grandparents and great-grandparents Frida never knew, and she listens intently.\n\n\"That's the beautiful part,\" he says. \"When you see her eyes and she's trying to soak in these people and to understand they've passed away and we're celebrating what they did, their way of life, what they used to eat, their favorite pastry \u2014 that's the important thing.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 20, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.5098721981048602, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1483, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.86205052551, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161101130000, "PurityVirtue": 3, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.22521915037087, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/22/donald-trump-executive-orders-monday-jerusalem-president/96920966/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 691, "scraper_regex": 761}}, "headline": "Trump prepares for busy Monday, pledges NAFTA changes, other executive orders", "wordcount_as_scraped": 761, "date": "20170122210000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, having declared post-inaugural Monday the true opening day of his new administration, spent Sunday pondering a string of executive orders on topics ranging from immigration to Israel to the economy, including what he called a re-working of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nSupervising the swearing-in of 30 new White House staff members, Trump said he will soon meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto to discuss changes to NAFTA, the trade deal he claims has shipped U.S. jobs to those other countries.\n\n\"We will start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA. Anyone ever hear of NAFTA? I ran a campaign somewhat based on NAFTA,\" he said. \"Mexico has been terrific, actually, and the president has been really quite amazing.\"\n\nTrump's public schedule for Monday includes separate meetings with corporate and union leaders, an intelligence briefing, lunch with Vice President Pence, a reception for congressional leaders and a one-on-one meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan. And in the morning, he's set aside time to ceremoniously sign executive orders.\n\nTwo days after his inauguration, Trump also spoke with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the Situation Room, and prepared to meet with law enforcement and first responders who worked during the inaugural weekend.\n\nTrump said his conversation with Netanyahu was \"very nice,\" but declined to elaborate. The White House later said the two men discussed Iran, the Islamic State, and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and that Trump invited Netanyahu to Washington in February. Netanyahu said he accepted.\n\nNot mentioned in the White House summary of the call: A possible plan to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Trump had pledged to do so during his campaign \u2014 bucking 20 years of precedent by Democratic and Republican presidents \u2014 although press secretary Sean Spicer said the White House was \"at the very beginning stages of even discussing this subject.\"\n\nThe Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 requires the president to move the embassy to Jerusalem unless he certifies every six months that it's not in the national interest. Every president since Bill Clinton has done so, including President Obama most recently last Dec. 1 \u2014 giving Trump until the end of May to make a formal decision.\n\nOther executive actions will likely come Monday. Trump told Fox News last week that \"Monday is really the day that we start signing and working and making great deals for the country.\"\n\nExpected executive orders in the coming days give Trump a chance to put his initial stamp on his administration, including plans to roll back chunks of President Obama's agenda. Trump and aides said orders are being designed to reverse Obama-backed restrictions on carbon emissions of energy production, as well as changes in immigration policy.\n\nTrump has also talked about taking actions to change trade policy, including shelving the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership with Asian nations as well as changes to NAFTA. Other possible topics of looming executive action include health care and national security.\n\nDuring his first weekend as president, Trump served repeated notice that he will continue to employ the outspoken tactics he used during his successful presidential campaign.\n\nIn a brief inaugural address, Trump attacked the political establishment for leaving behind an \"American carnage\" in the former of lost jobs and crime-ridden neighborhoods. During Saturday remarks to CIA officials, he criticized media coverage of various aspects of the inauguration. The new president maintained his Twitter feed, sending out messages ranging from more media attacks to television ratings for the inaugural.\n\nBut on Sunday, during his first public appearance in the formal East Room of the White House, Trump returned to a more conventionally presidential tone. \"As I said in my inaugural address, this is not about party. It's not about ideology. It's about country, our country, and it's about serving the American people,\" he said. \"We're not here to help ourselves. We're here to devote ourselves to the national good.\"\n\nDuring the ceremony, Trump said he received a \"beautiful letter\" from Obama, as is tradition when a new president moves into the White House. \"It was really very nice of him to do that. We will cherish that,\" he said. \"We won't even tell the press what's in that letter.\"\n\nLater, Trump held a reception for law enforcement agencies and first responders who worked to protect his inaugural events on Friday. He spotted FBI Director James Comey, who many Democrats blame for tipping the election by making public his investigations of Hillary Clinton's emails.\n\n\"He's become more famous than me,\" Trump quipped.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.527704477310181, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 691, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.25500250727, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170122210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.7626628075253303, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/01/30/advocacy-groups-leverage-anger-target-trump/97240668/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 506, "scraper_regex": 617}}, "headline": "Advocacy groups leverage anger to target Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 617, "date": "20170130200000", "story_content": "The massive protests that swept the nation in answer to President Trump's executive order on Muslim travel have encouraged advocacy groups to press their case on other issues.\n\nTrump's executive order, signed Friday, suspended entry of refugees to the U.S. for 120 days, halts admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely and bars entry for three months to residents from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.

His disagreement with the intelligence community stemmed from the IC's investigation of Russian cyber attacks on Democratic committees and officials.\n\nOn Oct. 7, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence put out a statement saying the Russian government \"directed\" the hacking \"to interfere with the US election process.\"\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence went further and released a declassified report that said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump\" and that he had waged a broad \"influence campaign\" to \"undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process\" and to help elect Trump.\n\nFor months, Trump refused to accept the intelligence community's findings of Russia's meddling in the election.\n\nDuring an Oct. 9, 2016, debate with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump said \"maybe there is no hacking.\" That was two days after the intelligence community said the Russian government \"directed\" the hacking.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News Sunday two months later, Trump said the intelligence community did not know who was behind the hacking.\n\nIn a statement around that time, Trump also questioned the intelligence community's track record \u2014 citing its intelligence work prior to the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nA month after that, Trump escalated his criticism of the intelligence community by questioning its motives.\n\nIn a Jan. 3, 2017, tweet, Trump claimed that intelligence officials had delayed a briefing with him on the Russia report. In that tweet, Trump dismissively used air quotes around the word \"intelligence\" to describe the briefing, and questioned whether the delay was needed \"to build a case\" against Russia.\n\nThe \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case.

Their monthly Part B premium will rise a relatively modest 3.9% to about $109 per month in 2017, from $104.90 for the past four years.\n\nMost of the rest will see their Part B premiums jump 10% to $134, up from $121.80 in 2016. And the fewer than 3 million people who signed up for Part B for the first time last year will see their premiums rise about $5 to $127, up from $121.80 in 2016, according to Raymond Thorn, spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nThe reason? The Social Security law contains a \"hold-harmless\" provision that limits the dollar increase for premiums for Part B \u2014 which covers physician services, outpatient hospital services, certain home health services, durable medical equipment and other items \u2014 to the dollar increase in an individual's Social Security benefit.\n\nIn October, the government announced that the nation's 65 million Social Security beneficiaries would receive a 0.3% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to their monthly checks in 2017. In dollars and cents, the average retired beneficiary's check would rise about $5 to $1,360 per month in 2017, from $1,355 in 2016.\n\nMedicare Part B premiums are typically deducted from Social Security beneficiaries' monthly checks, so the net effect of the COLA and the Part B premium increase is that 70% of Part B beneficiaries won't see any increase at all in their Social Security checks. They'll receive an extra $5 per month, but that money will go straight to Medicare to pay for their Part B premiums.\n\nThe hold harmless provision does not, however, protect those beneficiaries who: do not receive Social Security benefits; enroll in Part B for the first time in 2017; are directly billed for their Part B premiums; are dually eligible for Medicaid and have their premium paid by state Medicaid agencies; and higher-income beneficiaries who pay income-adjusted premiums.\n\nBecause of the \"hold harmless\" provision covering 70% of beneficiaries, premiums for the remaining 30% must cover most of the increase in Medicare costs for 2017 for all beneficiaries, the CMS said in a release.\n\nDeductibles are on the rise, too. The CMS announced that the annual deductible for all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will rise to $183 in 2017 from $166 in 2016. Also of note, the Medicare Part A inpatient hospital deductible that beneficiaries pay when admitted will be $1,316 per benefit period in 2017, an increase of $28 from 2016, the CMS said.\n\nHow to cope with rising prices\n\nWhat can current and future Medicare beneficiaries do to mitigate the higher costs of Part B premiums/deductibles and Part A premiums/deductibles?\n\n\u2022 Research options before turning 65. Diane Daniels, author of The Medicare Survival Guide and owner and CEO of Senior Advocates for Medicare and Medicaid, recommends looking into your Medicare plan options at least three to four months before turning 65.\n\n\"If you are still employed and on an employer's health insurance plan, compare your cost for your employer's plan against Medicare plans,\" she says. \"Don't forget to calculate the Medicare Part B premium into your comparison. You can participate in a credible employer health plan and not have to enroll in Medicare Part B when you turn 65\" without paying a late-enrollment penalty when you do sign up for Part B, as long as you do so within 63 days of leaving your employer health plan.\n\nAccording to Daniels, Medigap \u2014 or Medicare Supplement Insurance, which helps pay some of the costs that Original Medicare doesn't cover \u2014 is at least 80% of the time more cost effective than an employer's plan. \"The Medigap plan also provides the freedom to choose any physician in the United States who is contracted with Medicare,\" she says. But in other cases, the employer-sponsored plan might be your best bet. \"Take your time and do your due diligence,\" says Daniels.\n\n\"IRMAA has also increased by 10%, when compared to 2016, and the subtle point here is that for high-income earners, the question regarding whether a full-time employee (or owner) should elect to enroll in Part B or delay has become more complicated,\" says Oh.\n\nModified adjusted gross income (also known as MAGI, or modified AGI), which is adjusted gross income increased by tax-exempt income, is another income tax concept worth understanding. According to Schwartz, adjusted gross income is different from taxable income and is unaffected by itemized deductions. \"The key planning goal is to lower items of gross income rather than focusing on deductions,\" he says.\n\nSo, what are some ways to lower gross income? Pay attention to capital gains. \"Capital gains, in large part, can be controlled. Capital losses can be used to offset capital gains,\" says Schwartz. Ask your adviser to consider what can be done to reduce your capital gains between now and year's end.\n\nNote, too, that required minimum distributions can also trigger higher Medicare premiums. \"To the extent that distributions remain unpaid for 2016, there is the opportunity to deflect that income to a qualified charity to keep modified adjusted gross income under control,\" says Schwartz.\n\nAnd three, if you have a choice between using taxable IRA funds or after-tax dollars to fund living expenses, consider using the after-tax dollars. Those dollars could have a smaller impact on modified adjusted gross income, says Schwartz. Likewise, if you're tapping your after-tax account for living expenses, consider using assets that don't \"lead to problematic capital gains income,\" says Schwartz.\n\nIt's Medicare enrollment time\n\nThe Medicare Annual Enrollment Period, which ends Dec. 7, allows Medicare Advantage enrollees the opportunity to voluntarily make plan changes, which are effective Jan. 1, 2017. Individuals can make the following changes during the Annual Enrollment Period:\n\nMedicare Advantage plan advice\n\nSome three in 10 Medicare beneficiaries have Medicare Advantage plans. Here's what Daniels recommends for them during Annual Enrollment Period:\n\n1. If you have a Medicare adviser or insurance agent who can offer you several different Medicare Advantage carriers in their portfolio, call them.\n\nIt wouldn't be in your best interest to contact an insurance agent, who works for only one Medicare insurance carrier. These agents are only able to offer you Medicare Advantage Plans from their one carrier. They will not have your best interest in mind. If they don't enroll you in one of their plans, they won't get paid.\n\nUsing a Medicare adviser or insurance agent, who has different Medicare carriers available to you, will have your best interest. They will help find you a Medicare plan that fits your unique needs.\n\n2. Each state has a Department of Aging, with volunteers to assist you with your Medicare questions. Advise the representative that you'd like to speak with someone who is knowledgeable with the different Medicare Advantage Plans in your area and they will connect you with a person who is unbiased. Many states have educational seminars on Medicare at community senior centers. Ask if any will be in your area.\n\n3. Individuals can go onto the www.Medicare.gov website and use the plan finder database, but understand the information is not 100% complete.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.04194259643555, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1548, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.63725481631, "HarmVirtue": 16, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 8, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161116210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.5839793281653702, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/17/failure-find-malaysia-airlines-flight-370-leaves-many-questions-unanswered/96677490/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1011, "scraper_regex": 1219}}, "headline": "Failure to find Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 leaves many questions unanswered", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1219, "date": "20170117210000", "story_content": "As governments sail away from the nearly three-year search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, failing to find the wreckage and explain what went wrong for the 239 people aboard could haunt the industry that has reached lofty levels of safety.\n\nThe Boeing 777 disappeared without a distress call March 8, 2014, on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Based on clues from the plane's electronics, the governments of Malaysia, China and Australia spent $160 million scouring a section of the Indian Ocean floor the size of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe suspension Tuesday of the underwater search leaves fundamental questions unanswered: What went wrong? Was there a mechanical problem? Did somebody aboard the plane make a mistake \u2013 or crash it intentionally?\n\nThe search's end comes two months after investigators took another detailed look at the clues that dictated where they were looking, and a month after they found that another area of ocean floor the size of Vermont might be more promising.\n\n\"They're going to be haunted by what might or might not be in that zone,\" said David Gallo, who helped find Air France Flight 447 at the bottom of the Atlantic in 2011 and who is now senior advisor for strategic initiatives at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \"This should really drive them crazy.\"\n\nInvestigators say the plane's wreckage \u2013 and potentially the data and voice recorders \u2013 could explain whatever problems happened so that they could be avoided in the future. The Boeing 777 is a workhorse of the long-haul fleet, with 1,200 flying worldwide.\n\n\"We really do need to find the wreckage to ensure that there's no problem with the aircraft,\" said Al Diehl, a former investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nFor example, the recovery of Air France Flight 447 revealed that pilots made mistakes flying in a snowstorm, but also a problem with pitot tubes, sensors that stick out of the fuselage of the Airbus A330, that gave the pilots bad information.\n\nBoeing spokesman Doug Alder said the manufacturer has been fully dedicated to the Malaysia search and investigation. The company's thoughts continue to be with the families, friends and colleagues of those aboard the flight, he said.\n\n\"We accept the conclusion of government authorities leading the investigation and search that, in the absence of credible new information that leads to identification of a specific location of the aircraft, there will be no further expansion of the search area,\" Alder said.\n\nThe disappearance came at a time of dramatic improvements in safety. The number of fatalities aboard passenger airliners worldwide from 1959 throgh 2015 was 29,165, according to a Boeing study. But the total for the last decade was 3,133, according to the study. The last fatal crash of a U.S. passenger airline was in February 2009.\n\n\"Historically, we've achieved this very high level of aviation safety by finding the wreckage and other data, and analyzing it \u2013 lessons learned from previous accidents,\" Diehl said.\n\nFinding sunken planes is hard, even when the location is better known than the Malaysia flight. A Northwest Airlines plane that crashed in Lake Michigan in 1950 without modern tracking equipment has never been found. The Aviation Safety Network counts 84 planes, each with at least 14 people aboard, that have gone missing since 1948, typically over oceans, mountains or other remote areas.\n\nThe Malaysia flight's transponder and automated maintenance system stopped signaling less than an hour into the flight. But a satellite caught hourly pings from the plane, which suggested it flew far out over the ocean until running out of fuel.\n\nBecause the ocean is several miles deep in the search area, the vessels first mapped the ocean floor and then dragged sonar vehicles on miles-long cords to scan the bottom. They found details as small as anchors and as large as a shipwreck. But no airliner.\n\n\"It's probably one of the largest continuous maps of the seafloor ever made, with the resolution they made it,\" Gallo said.\n\nHe called deep-sea exploration one of the hardest tasks on Earth, comparable to space expeditions.\n\n\"You're actually mounting an expedition into an unknown world where the mountains are taller, the valleys are deeper and wider. There are volcanoes and earthquakes,\" Gallo said. \"It's almost like going to Mars, to look for a plane. You're mounting an expedition to an unknown world.\"\n\nMore than 20 fragments of the Malaysia plane have washed up on distant shores, along the coast of Africa, and the islands of Mauritius, Reunion and Rodriguez. Damage to flaps from the wings suggested that they were in position for cruising rather than landing when the plane plunged into the sea.\n\nThe search committee conducted a November review of how those fragments drifted and other data. In December, the committee changed its interpretation of where the wreckage might be, to north of where search vessels were focused, in an area of about 9,600 square miles.\n\n\"The experts concluded that, if this area were to be searched, prospective areas for locating the aircraft wreckage, based on all the analysis to date, would be exhausted,\" the committee said in a Dec. 20 report.\n\nBut without a more precise location, the transport ministers of the three countries in charge of the search announced Tuesday the last vessel had left the search area located about 1,000 miles west of Australia.\n\n\"The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness,\" said the statement from Liow Tiong Lai of Malaysia, Li Xiaopeng of China and Darren Chester of Australia. \"Whilst combined scientific studies have continued to refine areas of probability, to date no new information has been discovered to determine the specific location of the aircraft.\"\n\nChester told reporters that he understood the \"disappointment and frustration\" of relatives of the passengers, some of whom he met with, and that he shared their disappointment even if he couldn't \"possibly understand their grief.\"\n\n\"They have been waiting for answers now for almost three years, and it is the unanswered questions for them which is the most difficult part for them to deal with,\" Chester said.\n\nBut the three governments agreed in July that they would suspend the search if they didn't develop any more precise information about the plane's location.\n\n\"If I continue the search effort and came to you today and said I have reached agreement with Malaysia and China to find another 20, 30, 40 or 50 million dollars, you'd be saying to me well, 'Why are you spending taxpayers' money in this way?'\" Chester said. \"But by coming to you and saying that we agreed in July last year that in the absence of any credible new evidence leading to the specific location of the aircraft, we intend to suspend the search, you are now asking well why won't you extend it to a new area. I don't think there's a perfect answer.\"\n\nThe advocacy group Voice 370, which represents families of the passengers, urged the search to continue. The group called the November review \"a mere smokescreen\" and said requiring the \"precise location of the aircraft\" before continuing the effort would \"bury the search.\"\n\n\"In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety,\" the group said on its Facebook page.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.1847133636474596, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1011, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.2998382983, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.8793273986152301, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/spotlight/2017/01/04/keep-private-industry-out-prisoner-reform-column/96118228/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Keep private industry out of prisoner reform: Column", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1088, "date": "20170105030000", "story_content": "In 2015, for the third year in a row, the number of people held in privately operated, for-profit prisons went down, according to data released last week by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nThe new data top off a chaotic year for companies that own and operate prisons for profit.\n\nIn August, the Justice Department announced that it would phase out its use of private prisons for some federal prisoners. Almost immediately, stocks in the country's two largest private prison companies, Corrections Corp. of America (CCA) and GEO Group, plummeted.\n\nThe fact that the number of people incarcerated in for-profit prisons continues to decline suggests that the future of private prisons in the U.S. is anything but certain.\n\nBut the companies, ever the salesmen, have a backup plan. As fewer people have been sent to prisons and jails in recent years, the industry has diversified beyond the business of incarceration. Since 2005, the companies have collectively spent more than $680 million acquiring companies that provide services referred to as \"community corrections,\" such as residential re-entry (\"halfway houses\") and electronic monitoring.\n\nNew administration mean big business?\n\nBy late September, CCA's stock price had fallen more than 45% since the Justice Department's announcement, and in October the company revealed it would be rebranding under a new name, CoreCivic.\n\nThen, Donald Trump won the presidential election. The next day, CoreCivic's stock shot up over 43%, more than any other that day on the New York stock exchange. A Trump presidency could mean big business for private prison companies. The president-elect praised private prisons on the campaign trail and has promised to restore \"law and order,\" a throwback to the dog-whistle politics that ushered in the era of mass incarceration.\n\nYet the jury is out on whether a return to \"tough on crime\" policy at the federal level would trickle down to states. While Trump will control the federal prison system, presidents have little power over state prisons and local jails, where a vast majority of the incarcerated population is held.\n\nBut there is much money to be made by providing community corrections services, which are widely used across the criminal justice system as alternatives to incarceration and community supervision, such as probation, parole or home detention (\"house arrest\"). In 2014, an estimated 4.7 million people \u2014 more than double the prison population \u2014 were on some form of community supervision, many of them wearing GPS ankle monitors, living in a halfway house, or subject to alcohol and drug testing.\n\nWhat many see as justice \u2014 fewer people incarcerated \u2014 CoreCivic and GEO Group see as a business opportunity.\n\nA GEO Group executive recently told investors, \"We believe that the emphasis on offender rehabilitation and community re-entry programs as part of criminal justice reform will create growth opportunities for our company.\" One such \"growth opportunity\" was the company's acquisition of B.I. Incorporated, one of the country's largest providers of GPS ankle monitoring services.\n\nIf efforts to end mass incarceration at the state level continue and more people are released early or sentenced to alternatives, the number of people on community supervision could explode in the coming years. That could mean untold profit for two companies that together profited $361 million in 2015 alone.\n\nAt first glance, that a private company profits from supervision or helping people re-enter society seems beside the point. If the goal is to get people out of prisons and jails, then why worry about services such as electronic monitoring or re-entry?\n\nSuch thinking ignores recent history. America's prison population is the result of countless policies and decisions, but it could not have happened without the private prison industry. As the prison population quintupled in the past four decades, companies such as CCA and GEO Group helped provide enough prisons to hold that population and used political influence to expand their control of the criminal justice system. They've marketed facilities to local governments and federal agencies. They've signed contracts with occupancy guarantees that incentivize incarceration and put taxpayers on the hook.\n\nBy diversifying into community corrections, the same multibillion dollar industry that enabled the country's addiction to incarceration could dramatically shape how we recover from that addiction.\n\nProfiting from the poor\n\nWhat that recovery will look like is still coming into view, but there are glimpses in the ways community corrections are being used. Electronic monitoring can be especially hard on the same communities most impacted by mass incarceration, the poor and people of color. For example, the cost of a GPS ankle monitor \u2014 as high as $40 a day \u2014 can be passed along to the person ordered to wear it. When the person falls behind on his payments, the company providing the monitor can charge late fees, and anyone who can't afford the fees can be sent back to prison or jail.\n\nThis \"offender funded\" model of supervision is often used with alcohol monitoring and drug testing as well, a fact not lost on GEO Group, which recently bought a portion of Soberlink Inc., a provider of \"mobile-breath sobriety\" monitoring.\n\nPrivately operated halfway houses pose a different, yet familiar, problem. Across the country, many are plagued with issues similar to those found in private prisons, including poorly supervised residents and criminal behavior by employees. New Jersey officials have called their halfway houses \"an innovative example of privatization,\" but The New York Times, following a 10-month investigation, called them a \"shadow corrections network, where drugs, gang activity and violence, including sexual assaults, often go unchecked.\"\n\nReturning citizens need viable re-entry services, including job placement and housing assistance, and some require substance abuse programs. But private halfway house operators too often view such services like they do prisons and jails, as vehicles for profit, not for care or justice.\n\nIn private hands, services such as residential re-entry and electronic monitoring could be used on greater numbers of the population and for longer periods of time simply because doing so would be in the financial interest of the companies providing those services. If those hands belong to CoreCivic and GEO Group, who together spend millions of dollars each year influencing public officials, the end of the mass incarceration era could be devastating to the poor and communities of color.\n\nWhen we advocate for alternatives to incarceration, we must be vocal about the potential harms of allowing those alternatives to be sources of profit for companies, especially those with strong political influence, such as CoreCivic and GEO Group. If we don't, mass incarceration could be rebranded like a company that has merely changed its name.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 22, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.1948881149292006, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1074, "FairnessVirtue": 7, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.22843386653, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5381750465549304, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/humankind/2016/11/29/91-year-old-man-knits-hats-homeless/93979928/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "91-year-old man knits hats for the homeless", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1316, "date": "20161129100000", "story_content": "GRANDVILLE, Mich. -- When you reach the end of your life, what will go through your mind? Which areas of your life will you scrutinize and take inventory? Will you evaluate whether or not you were a good son, sibling, father and friend? Maybe you'll think about the accomplishments you accumulated or, perhaps, some of the failures and shortcomings.\n\nOthers may focus exclusively on the end, lean on their faith, and concentrate on what they believe is to come in the afterlife.\n\nMorrie Boogaart knows he's nearing the end of his life. The 91-years old is currently a resident at Cambridge Manor assisted living facility in Grandville, Michigan. He's barely mobile, spending every day bedridden. Family members visit him regularly, but when they leave, Morrie is left with his life-long memories to stimulate him.\n\nA well-worn bible sits innocently on his nightstand, and hanging on one of his walls is an 8x10 photo of his wife Donna Mae, who passed away 16 years ago.\n\n\"I had a good life,\" said Boogaart, while he slowly wraps yarn around his spindle. \"I have always accepted what I had in life, and this is now what it is for me.\"\n\nRight next to Morrie's nightstand is a pile of brown boxes stacked on top of each other. None of the boxes can be closed because each one is overflowing with more yarn.\n\n\"I just like to do it,\" said Morrie, as he continued knitting. \"My eyes aren't as good as they used to be, but I can still do this.\"\n\nBoogaart wakes up every morning and starts knitting. He doesn't stop knitting until he falls asleep at night. This happens all day, every day.\n\n\"This is my life,\" said Morrie. \"I have always liked to helped people, and I'm not going to stop now.\n\n\"We all need a sense of purpose.\"\n\nMorrie knits hats, and since he started doing it nearly 15 years ago, he claims to have knitted at least 8,000 of them.\n\n\"That's why most people call me the 'Hat Man,'\" he said.\n\nWord of the Hat Man's creations began circulating far beyond the four walls of his room at Cambridge Manor a while ago. As people learned of his hobby, they began donating yarn.\n\n\"I would come visit him and there would be piles of yarn in his room,\" said Karen Lauters, Morrie's daughter. \"The donations have been coming in from not just people visiting the nursing home, but from around the community, including several Churches in the area.\"\n\nWhen asked what he wanted as gifts each year for Christmas, Father's Day and his birthday, he'd ask for only one item - Yarn.\n\n\"What else do you give him,\" Lauters said, jokingly. \"Yarn is truly all he needs, and what he's doing with it is truly amazing and inspiring.\"\n\nKnitting hats isn't just a hobby for Morrie. He has made it certain that every hat he knits gets donated to a homeless shelter in West Michigan so people in need can have a warm hat to wear.\n\n\"When people heard the reason behind why my dad was making the hats, social media grabbed a hold of it, and yarn started being shipped to us from all over the world,\" said Lauters. \"We received yarn from as far away as Australia and we heard that people were discussing it on Twitter in China.\"\n\nRick Snyder, the Governor of Michigan, was informed of what Morrie was doing. The governor took the time to write, sign and mail Morrie a letter.\n\n\"I can't believe the amount of attention this has received,\" added Lauters. \"It's all sort of rejuvenated his spirit for life.\"\n\nMorrie hopes to knit hats for as long as his health allows, but his health has been failing in recent months. He was diagnosed with skin cancer in the summer of 2015. The cancer started to spread, and a mass has shown up on his kidney.\n\n\"We put my dad into Hospice care a little over a year ago, after he had acquired pneumonia on top of the cancer,\" said Lauters. \"As a family, we didn't think he was going to recover, but he recovered from the pneumonia and was taken out of Hospice care.\n\n\"His health hasn't worsened over the course of the past year, but the cancer will likely eventually claim his life. Surgery was presented as an option to our family by doctors, but it was determined at his age he probably wouldn't survive any extreme medical procedures, so we've all accepted the situation for what it is.\"\n\nWhile Morrie has spent the better part of the last 18 months enduring his own cancer battle, he lost his son Russell to the disease in November 2015.\n\n\"Russell died just six months after he was diagnosed,\" Morrie said. \"That was very hard on me because I wasn't able to make it to his funeral and properly say goodbye.\"\n\nIt's been constantly knitting hats that has kept Morrie going, and continuing to focus on living rather than dying. Knowing that every loop he makes on his hoop is going toward helping those in need, while helping him discover some purpose.\n\n\"Some days are good, and other days aren't so good, but I don't ever want to quit doing this,\" said Morrie. \"There's too many homeless people out there who need others to care about them.\"\n\nKaren Lauters visits her father often, but there are other times when her visits are strictly business. Sometimes, her sole purpose in visiting is to take all of the hats Morrie has finished knitting, box them up, and deliver them to homeless shelters that her dad suggests.\n\n\"He would sort all the hats into the boxes and would write on them where he wants them to go,\" said Lauters. \"Some boxes would be labeled 'Mel Trotter' and others would say 'Salvation Army.'\"\n\nKaren loads 8 to 10 boxes of hats into her vehicle at a time, then personally drives them to the shelters. On this day, she delivered several boxes to Mel Trotter Ministries in downtown Grand Rapids.\n\n\"We get donations dropped off here all the time at Mel Trotter,\" said Abbey Sladick, director of communications for Mel Trotter. \"Rarely do we get to see the faces behind the donations, but when we learned about Morrie and what he was doing, he was somebody we wanted to meet.\"\n\nAbbey and Karen emptied all the hats from the boxes and spread them on a table near the entrance to the cafeteria. As residents of Mel Trotter lined up for lunch, Sladick directed them to the table where they could select a hat to keep.\n\n\"A winter hat means a lot to people here,\" said Sladick. \"Knowing that they have something on their head that keeps them warm, and was knitted with love, I think is wonderful.\n\n\"Morrie teaches everybody that no matter how old we are, or what medical condition we may have, we can all give back in some way.\n\n\"We can all learn from Morrie Boogaart.\"\n\nKaren Lauters knows her father is in the sunset of his life, but she's beyond thrilled and is extremely proud of how he's found purpose and meaning in the face of his terminal illness.\n\n\"We should all be as driven as my dad,\" said Lauters. \"What he's done [knitting all the hats and donating them to homeless shelters] has touched a lot of people, and it's been the best thing that could have ever happened for him, given his circumstances.\"\n\nIf his health allows, the Hat Man will continue knitting hats from his bed at the Grandville assisted living facility. His goal will continue to be to start and finish three hats per day, insuring that his 'end' might be a 'beginning' for those in need.\n\n\"If you take this [knitting hats] away from me, my life is over,\" Morrie said. \"Please don't take it away.\"\n\n***", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.490539580583572, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1287, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.55840859627, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161129100000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 1.70940170940171, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/14/wilmington-del-loses-insurance-gamble-must-pay-9m/96605288/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Wilmington, Del., loses insurance gamble, must pay $9M", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1172, "date": "20170115040000", "story_content": "WILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 The Sept. 24 fire in a Canby Park rowhome will go down in Wilmington as one of the most traumatic events in city history. The tragedy ultimately took the lives of three firefighters and injured four more, leaving the department and community reeling.\n\nIn the days that followed, city officials realized they had another \"very serious\" problem, said Mayor Mike Purzycki.\n\nOfficials have no idea how high costs could go. The city is still receiving hospital bills old and new, Purzycki said.

Who's supposed to be in charge of this?\" asked City Councilwoman Loretta Walsh, chair of the public safety committee. \"How did it slip through so many fingers?\"\n\nNow the new mayor is faced with a challenge.\n\n\"When you're trying to put together a financial plan for the city and all a sudden you find yourself with a $7 to $9 million liability, it's unsettling,\" Purzycki said. \"It certainly wasn't something we anticipated.\"\n\nFirefighters Ardythe Hope and Speakman were both critically injured the blaze. The fire \u2013\u2013 which police allege was intentionally set by Beatriz Fana-Ruiz, an intoxicated and unstable resident, according to police \u2013\u2013 burned over 70 percent of Hope's body and over 30 percent of Speakman's body. Hope succumbed to her injuries weeks later.\n\nThree other injured firefighters, John Crawthray, Terrance Tate and Peter Cramer, were treated at Christiana Care Medical Center. The city is absorbing the cost of each individual's fire-related health care. Capt. Christopher Leach and Lt. Jerry Fickes died fighting the rowhome fire.\n\nUnder the 2008 Workers Compensation Reform Law, Delaware and participating out-of-state hospitals treating workers' compensation injuries may only charge up to 80% of their usual charges, said John Rago, Purzycki's deputy chief of staff for policy and communications.\n\nBut Delaware has no facilities to treat serious burn victims, and Crozer-Chester Medical Center, where Hope and Speakman were treated, does not participate in the discount program.\n\nThe city hired a third-party consultant, PMA Management Corp., to negotiate the price down with Crozer-Chester, Rago said. The consultant secured a 15% discount on the initial hospital bill for a total of $3,470,867.22 on Nov. 14 and a 22.5% discount on the second payment of $2,671,951.99 on Dec. 18, Rago said. Recent specialist bills, due at the end of this month, will be discounted 32%, Rago said.\n\nPMA is entitled to 35% any cost savings they negotiate, Rago said, but \"due to this extraordinary situation and the exorbitant bills,\" they have limited their charges to $10,000 per invoice.\n\nThe mayor said his office is trying to find out who established the workers'comp plan and when.\n\n\"What we have to understand is the thinking that went into not having any protection at all for potential liability like this,\" Purzycki said. \"We may find this was a decision made 30 years ago and no one ever changed it. We still have a lot of questions.\"\n\nPurzycki has been advised that catastrophic loss coverage, a \"workers'comp umbrella policy,\" would cost about $350,000 to $400,000 a year. The Canby Park fire was the first fatal fire in the city in almost two decades. Because of the rarity of such severe fires in Wilmington, Purzycki said, it's possible that the city took a chance by forgoing coverage for the injured.\n\n\"We'd never had anything like that happen before so even though we might have a large expense this year, on an ongoing basis, we would've come out ahead,\" he said.\n\nWithout conducting an analysis of its claims history and insurance rates in the past, city officials couldn't say this week whether they would have saved more money with or without insurance.\n\nCity Auditor Earl Jeter said his office conducted an audit of risk management for the first time in 2016 but did not review workers'compensation. He said the \"huge amount\" of money the city is paying could inspire another review.\n\n\"That's something that we might be thinking about in the near future,\" he said.\n\nAl Greto, founder of the Delaware and Pennsylvania law firm GretoLaw, said it's not necessarily a bad idea to forgo insurance. He said he would expect an actuary to investigate the city's claims history and the costs of insurance before making that decision.\n\n\"Insurance companies are in the business of collecting more premiums than paying out claims,' he said. \"Maybe the city is cutting out the middleman and this time the numbers didn't work out, but over time, they could.\"\n\nDouglas S. Kerr, the risk manager for Baltimore, Md., said Wilmington's choice not to insure is one made by many municipalities. Baltimore is \"100% self-insured,\" he said.\n\n\"We looked at the marketplace to determine if insurance was the right way to go,\" he said. \"We felt it better off being self-insured.\"\n\nPhiladelphia's Risk Manager, Barry Scott, said the same. Philly is self-insured, he said, and the city is prepared to absorb worker's compensation costs if claims arise.\n\n\"It's a matter of weighing the risks and the costs,\" he said.\n\nThe city's risk management committee is comprised of the administrative assistant to the mayor, the city solicitor, the finance director, the city treasurer and two City Council members, according to the city code. The group is supposed to review the risk management program at least annually, the code states.\n\nPurzycki said he is looking forward. He is considering obtaining high-deductible insurance coverage for worker's compensation expenses and other cost-containment measures.\n\n\"We're not trying to blame anybody,\" he said. \"We're going department by department and reviewing every policy, every procedure, every expectation. We're reimagining the way the city works.\"\n\nThe city has already paid about $6 million of the bills from \"cash on hand,\" Purzycki said, but when the fiscal year ends in June, officials will have to reconcile the costs.\n\nThe mayor said he isn't prepared to comment on whether he will raise taxes until he establishes a comprehensive spending and funding plan.\n\n\"It doesn't help my 2018 budget,\" Purzycki said. \"It's very likely we'll have a liability to carry forward.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.70370364189148, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1228, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.62726133514, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170115040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.2801302931596097, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2017/01/19/walmart-sued-down-syndrome-firing/96763814/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 551, "scraper_regex": 461}}, "headline": "Walmart sued for firing of employee with Down syndrome", "wordcount_as_scraped": 461, "date": "20170119130000", "story_content": "MANITOWOC, Wis. \u2014 Walmart is facing a federal lawsuit from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunities Commission over termination of a 15-year employee with Down syndrome at a Wisconsin store.\n\nAccording to a news release from the EEOC on Wednesday, Marlo Spaeth, of Manitowoc, Wis., was disciplined for absenteeism after management changed her schedule of 15 years. Spaeth typically worked from noon to 4 p.m. The new scheduling system called for Spaeth to work later and longer shifts and, because of her disability, she was unable to adapt to the changes in routine, the news release said.\n\nWalmart did not change Spaeth's schedule even after she requested the changes, the news release added. The new schedule took effect in November 2014 and Spaeth was fired for attendance issues July 10, 2015.\n\nAmy Jo Stevenson, Spaeth's sister and legal guardian, became involved when she received the call from Walmart regarding the termination. Stevenson said she was told the computerized scheduling system could not change Spaeth's schedule back to what it was originally and was told Spaeth would not be rehired.\n\n\"The manager I talked to, she said 'Well, we have to treat her just like everyone else,' and I was done talking to her at that point because that is the farthest from the truth,\" said Stevenson.\n\nShe decided to bring the matter to the EEOC because they had experience dealing with similar cases, she said.\n\n\"From the first moment I heard about it (Spaeth's termination from Walmart), it didn't feel right,\" Stevenson said. \"I think it is wrong and I didn't let it drop. I think they (Walmart) expected me to drop it.\"\n\nStevenson said Spaeth's Down syndrome makes it extremely difficult to make any changes to her routine.\n\n\"We are talking about a person who just can't easily be taken out of their habits and rituals,\" Stevenson said. \"It is something that needs to be respected.\"\n\nStevenson said Spaeth was devastated by the termination and still misses working there.\n\nIn a statement released by Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove, he said Spaeth understood her job requirements and understood the importance of working her full work schedule. He said even after being spoken to about her absenteeism, she continually failed to complete her assigned shift.\n\n\"We're sensitive to this situation and we tried to reach an amicable resolution that would support Ms. Spaeth,\" said Hargrove. \"We remain open to continuing those discussions, but the EEOC has not acted in her best interest.\"\n\nThe EEOC sees Walmart's actions as a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\n\"Even the nation's largest private employer must comply with the law's requirement to make a good-faith effort to accommodate an employee with a disability,\" said Julianne Bowman, EEOC district director of the Chicago District, in the news release.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.45499181747437, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 551, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.05703790891, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170119130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.2667876588021802, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/01/20/his-own-words-president-trumps-inaugural-address/96836330/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1261, "scraper_regex": 1433}}, "headline": "Transcript of President Trump's inauguration speech", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1433, "date": "20170120180000", "story_content": "Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans and people of the world: Thank you.\n\nWe, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.\n\nTogether, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.\n\nWe will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.\n\nEvery four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.\n\nToday's ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another \u2013 but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American People.\n\nFor too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.\n\nWashington flourished \u2013 but the people did not share in its wealth.\n\nPoliticians prospered \u2013 but the jobs left, and the factories closed.\n\nThe establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.\n\nTheir victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\n\nThat all changes \u2013 starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.\n\nIt belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.\n\nThis is your day.

Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success.

And now we are looking only to the future.\n\nWe assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power.\n\nFrom this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.\n\nFrom this moment on, it's going to be America First.\n\nEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\n\nWe must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.\n\nI will fight for you with every breath in my body \u2013 and I will never, ever let you down.\n\nAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before.\n\nWe will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.\n\nWe will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.\n\nWe will get our people off of welfare and back to work \u2013 rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\n\nWe will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.\n\nWe will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world \u2013 but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\n\nWe do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.\n\nWe will reinforce old alliances and form new ones \u2013 and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.\n\nAt the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.\n\nWhen you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.\n\nThe Bible tells us, \"how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.\"\n\nWe must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.\n\nWhen America is united, America is totally unstoppable.\n\nThere should be no fear \u2013 we are protected, and we will always be protected.\n\nWe will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.\n\nFinally, we must think big and dream even bigger.\n\nIn America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.\n\nWe will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action \u2013 constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.\n\nThe time for empty talk is over.\n\nNow arrives the hour of action.\n\nDo not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.\n\nWe will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.\n\nWe stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.\n\nA new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions.\n\nIt is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: That whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.\n\nAnd whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.\n\nSo to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:\n\nYou will never be ignored again.\n\nYour voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.\n\nTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again.

Armstrong said that the people around her \u2014 including her parents, treating psychiatrist and physicians, the bioethics committee of Morristown Medical Center, her guardian and lawyer \u2014 all concur that it's in A.G.'s best interests to be transferred to a palliative care unit at the hospital where she won't be force-fed as the state Department of Human Services, which operates Greystone Psychiatric Hospital in Parsippany, wanted.\n\n\"The lessons of the landmark cases of Karen Ann Quinlan, Clare Conroy, Nancy Ellen Jobes, Kathleen Farrell, Hilda Peter and Nancy Cruzan are that patients, their families, physicians, and their institutions remain proper cooperators in making the evolving and necessary difficult decisions fronting modern medicine,\" Armstrong said.\n\nThe Department of Human Services wanted A.G. \u2014 who has weighed between 60 and 69 pounds in the past year \u2014 to be force-fed through a nasogastric tube and additionally helped through an experimental program of Ketamine use for her depression and increased time with family and her pets.\n\nState Deputy Attorney General Gene Rosenblum had contended that A.G. was not mentally competent to decide whether she should be artificially fed.\n\nArmstrong noted that A.G. expressed a refusal to be force fed to family and physicians, in a document signed at Greystone, and clearly to him, when he and court-appointed attorney Edward G. D'Alessandro Jr. and others met with A.G. at Morristown Medical Center on Nov. 3.\n\nArmstrong said that A.G. was oriented, responsive and understood the court case focusing on her. At Greystone, she had signed a Practitioner's Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment document that stated, in declining medical intervention, that she \"wanted to live freely\" without being bothered by anyone.\n\nHe also found that all the medical testimony he heard at a hearing on Nov. 4, along with scholarly treatises presented to him on treatment of anorexics, that A.G. has a \"dire diagnosis and poor prognosis.\"\n\nArmstrong said that during the interview with A.G. on Nov. 3, \"Her testimony may be fairly summarized as an impassioned, deeply-held rejection\" of daily force-feeding and further treatment for the disorder.\n\n\"A.G. expressed an unequivocal desire to accept palliative care as suggested by her treating physician and the bioethics committee at Morristown Medical Center. This decision was made by A.G. with a clear understanding that death was or could be the possible outcome,\" the judge said.\n\nArmstrong referred liberally to the Karen Ann Quinlan case, in which the state Supreme Court in March 1976 ruled that Quinlan could be removed from a ventilator but addressed the issues of self-determination and how families are best situated to make medical decisions for incapacitated people. In A.G.'s case, her parents \u2014 who did not attend Monday's ruling but have been in close touch with the hospital \u2014 helped their daughter for more than 10 years by admitting her to facilities for eating disorders, attending therapy sessions with her, and managing her medications.\n\nA.G., who suffers from depression and alcoholism along with anorexia, has been committed as a patient to Greystone since 2014. This past June, when her weight was around 60 pounds, state deputy attorneys general representing Greystone asked Superior Court to name a guardian for A.G. That pro bono guardian, Susan Joseph, then obtained a court order that A.G. be artificially fed at Morristown Medical Center.\n\nThe feeding tube brought A.G.'s weight up to 90 pounds but it also resulted in \"re-feeding syndrome,\" which damaged her heart, and it was removed. A.G. has been living at the hospital on diet soda and black coffee and occasional nibbles of food.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.9428571462631201, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 770, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.0855568633599995, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161122220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.50649350649351, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/04/accused-iowa-shooter-family-troubles/93280016/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 817, "scraper_regex": 728}}, "headline": "Details emerge of accused Iowa shooter's family troubles", "wordcount_as_scraped": 728, "date": "20161104120000", "story_content": "DES MOINES \u2014 Court records surrounding the man accused of shooting two Iowa police officers show a host of family troubles that culminated with him being ordered to move from his mother's basement one day before he allegedly ambushed the two officers.\n\nScott Michael Greene had a dispute with his mother, Patricia Greene, on Oct. 16 that resulted in her being charged with domestic assault for allegedly slapping her son.\n\nThat dispute prompted Patricia Greene to ask Polk County, Iowa, court officials to remove her son from her home.\n\nThe domestic charge against Patricia Greene was dropped Thursday by Assistant Polk County Attorney Mark Sandon, who said there was insufficient evidence to proceed. A no-contact order that barred Patricia Greene from being in contact with her son also was lifted Thursday.\n\nGreene, 46, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the slayings of Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin, 24, and Des Moines Police Sgt. Anthony \"Tony\" Beminio, 38. He is accused of gunning down both officers in their cars in separate shootings early Wednesday morning.\n\nOn Thursday, he was taken to jail in the handcuffs of the two officers.\n\n\"It's definitely an appropriate gesture given the circumstances,\" said Sgt. Paul Parizek, Des Moines police spokesman. Greene was \"directly informed that that's exactly whose handcuffs those were.\"\n\nParizek declined to describe how Greene reacted to the information.\n\nGreene is in the Polk County Jail, where he is being held without bond. He is expected to have an initial appearance before a judge Friday.\n\nPublic records and firsthand accounts of Greene indicate he has struggled with erratic and volatile behavior.\n\nDim Allen said those issues developed years before Wednesday's shootings.\n\nAllen's daughter, Joy Allen, was in a 16-year relationship with Greene. The couple lived together in Urbandale, Iowa, during much of their relationship.\n\nDim Allen described Greene as antisocial and she felt uneasy about her daughter's safety, although she said she was not aware of any physical abuse.\n\nJoy Allen and Greene have a daughter who is now a teenager, but they never married. Greene has a daughter and son from a prior relationship. Both are now adults.\n\nWhen the couple split about eight years ago, Dim Allen said she warned Greene to stay away, claiming he was controlling and angry.\n\n\"I told him: 'You leave her alone, or I'll call the cops on you,' \" Dim Allen said.\n\nHowever, Greene had custody of his younger daughter \u2014 Dim Allen's granddaughter \u2014 up until Wednesday's shootings. Joy Allen paid child support, her mother said.\n\nJoy Allen declined to comment Thursday.\n\nMark Egly, a longtime child advocate, said he temporarily fostered Greene's oldest daughter about a decade ago. He said back then, Greene \"tried to do what's best for his children, knowing he had some challenges.\"\n\n\"At that point and time, he was OK with staying within the borders of the law,\" said Egly. \"(Wednesday), things changed.\"\n\nGreene and Joy Allen met when he worked in West Des Moines as a mechanic, Dim Allen said.\n\nGreene worked at Pigott, a Des Moines furniture store, from June 2006 through August 2013, the business confirmed Wednesday.\n\nBut much of his recent work history is unknown.\n\nIn an online video posted Oct. 27, presumably by Greene, he claimed he was fired for reporting a workplace safety violation. But Sara Nicklin, manager of Central Iowa Fencing where Greene worked for three days last month, said Thursday that Greene \"refused to work\" and didn't come back after being given another chance to return with a different crew.\n\n\"We just knew that he wasn't a fit here,\" said Nicklin.\n\nAlthough investigators were looking into reports that Greene was in the military, three government agencies said Thursday they had found no record that Greene had served in any branch of the military, despite acquaintances reporting that he had claimed to suffer from post-traumatic stress.\n\nThe FBI, the Iowa National Guard and the National Personnel Records Center, which houses the federal government's military and civil service records, all said they had no record of military service by Greene.\n\nPaul Wilson, a guitar store owner from Urbandale, on Wednesday said Greene had recently told him \"how he was armed all the time and he was a stress victim from the military.\"\n\nAnd he said Greene's presence made him uneasy.\n\n\"I didn't have a good feeling about having the guy around,\" Wilson said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 24, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.63276815414429, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 817, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.83694388253, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161104120000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.0183598531211695, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/17/reporter-who-witnessed-lewis-beating-calls-trump-tweet-beyond-pale/96687812/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 656, "scraper_regex": 554}}, "headline": "Reporter who witnessed Lewis beating calls Trump tweet 'beyond the pale'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 554, "date": "20170117230000", "story_content": "MEMPHIS \u2014 Moses Newson is 89 now, but he's never forgotten the day in 1961 when a South Carolina mob beat future congressman John Lewis for challenging that state's segregated interstate bus stations.\n\n\"That's when I saw the first blood on the Freedom Rides,'' says Newson, formerly of Memphis, who rode alongside Lewis as a journalist covering the first wave of Freedom Riders venturing into the Deep South. At the Greyhound station in Rock Hill, S.C., young men in leather jackets punched Lewis to the floor, then kicked him repeatedly.\n\n\"There were toughs all around the bus station,'' Newson recalled. \"John Lewis was bloody.''\n\nNewson said what he witnessed that day stands in stark contrast to recent comments by President-elect Donald Trump, who declared in one of his recent Twitter feuds that Lewis is \"All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!''\n\nSpeaking by phone from his home in Baltimore, Newson said Lewis exhibited extreme bravery as he and colleagues with the Congress of Racial Equality challenged the Jim Crow South's defiance of federal laws banning discrimination in interstate travel.\n\n\"I just don't understand how the president-elect could suggest that John Lewis has never done anything,'' he said. \"That's a little beyond the pale.''\n\nNewson covered the Freedom Rides as a reporter with The Baltimore Afro American, the weekly newspaper where he eventually became editor. Newson started his long journalism career in Memphis, working from 1952 to 1957 at the Tri-State Defender, where he covered the 1955 Emmett Till murder trial and the 1957 Little Rock school crisis.\n\nIn May 1961, Newson was assigned to cover the Freedom Rides first sponsored by CORE and later assumed by members of the Nashville Student Movement after a series of violent attacks temporarily halted the campaign. With impetus from a recent Supreme Court decision, the Freedom Rides tested segregated bathroom and restaurant facilities in bus and train stations throughout the South.\n\n\"I knew the South pretty well.

They wore leather jackets, had those ducktail haircuts and were each smoking a cigarette.''\n\nLewis was punched twice in the head and kicked. \"I could taste blood in my mouth,'' he wrote.\n\nThough Lewis temporarily left the Freedom Rides because of a conflict, he rejoined the group in Alabama where he and Freedom Rider Jim Zwerg were famously blooded in the Montgomery bus station.\n\nNewson was on the Greyhound bus that was firebombed in Anniston, Ala., and recalls how the mob there beat the sides of the bus with pipes and sticks before someone lobbed an incendiary object inside.\n\n\"Just seeing American citizens trying to kill other American citizens for doing what they law allowed, to peacefully protest, that was a painful thing,'' he said.\n\n\nNewson had the opportunity to witness other actions by Lewis over the years.\n\n\"John was at the (1965) Selma march and almost got beat to death,'' he said. \"To say he hadn't done anything but talked, I think that is really uncalled for.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.64158689975739, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 656, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.9750509984, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117230000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.2012195121951197, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/01/turkey-nightclub-massacre-what-we-know-now/96057936/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 567, "scraper_regex": 441}}, "headline": "Turkey nightclub massacre: What we know now", "wordcount_as_scraped": 441, "date": "20170101180000", "story_content": "Authorities are searching for a gunman who opened fire Sunday at a packed nightclub during New Year's celebrations in Istanbul.

Here is what we know so far.\n\nVictims\n\nThe gunman killed at least 39 people and injured 69. Three of the wounded remain in critical condition, according to Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim. Nearly two-thirds of those killed \u2014 24 victims \u2014 were from other countries, according to the Associated Press, including an 18-year-old Israeli woman, three Indian citizens, a 26-year-old man from Lebanon and a Belgian national, according to the countries' respective foreign ministries and a relative. State-run Anadolu news agency reported Sunday that a 22-year-old police officer, Burak Yildiz, was shot and killed outside the nightclub. A female security guard, Hatice Karcilar, 29, was also among those killed, according to Anadolu. No word yet on any American victims.\n\nThe suspect\n\nThe weapon\n\nTurkey's prime minister said the attacker left a gun inside the venue and escaped by \"taking advantage of the chaos\" that ensued. \"Unfortunately, (he) rained bullets in a very cruel and merciless way on innocent people who were there to celebrate New Year's and have fun,\" Istanbul Gov. Vasip Sahin told reporters.\n\nTurkey on high alert\n\nTurkey is a member of NATO and a partner in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group. The bloodiest attacks that Turkey endured in 2016 were the work of the Islamic State group or Kurdish militants. Turkish security forces have been on high alert after a Russian ambassador to Turkey was killed Dec. 19 while attending a photo exhibition. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the country is \"extremely determined to do whatever it takes\" to secure the region after recent terror attacks. This is the fourth major attack in Turkey in the past month.\n\nThe club\n\nReina owner Mehmet Kocarslan told the private Dogan news agency that police had recently boosted security measures in the upscale neighborhood of Ortakoy and its vicinity. The efforts included a 24-hour police presence and complementary efforts by the coast guard at sea.\n\nWhat world leaders are saying\n\nThe White House condemned what it called a \"horrific terrorist attack\" and offered U.S. help to Turkey. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his Turkish counterpart a telegram of condolences, saying \"it is hard to imagine a more cynical crime than killing innocent people during New Year celebrations.\"\n\nIf you're an American in Turkey\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Istanbul on Sunday warned American citizens to keep their movements in the city \"to an absolute minimum.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.60225439071655, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 567, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 22, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.0820831577, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 43, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170101180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 7.58377425044092, "mft_mean": 3.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/11/14/first-9-minneapolis-men-sentenced-isil-plot/93801342/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Three of 9 Minneapolis men sentenced in ISIL plot", "wordcount_as_scraped": 550, "date": "20161114200000", "story_content": "Three young men of Somali descent from the Minneapolis area were sentenced on Monday to prison terms, ranging from time served to 10 years behind bars, for their parts in a wide-ranging plot to join the terror group Islamic State.\n\nAbdullahi Yusuf, 20, who helped build a case against eight of his friends who plotted to join ISIL will get out of prison with time served, but spend 20 years under supervised release for his role in the conspiracy, U.S. District Judge Michael Davis ruled.\n\nYusuf, who was arrested in 2014 and pleaded guilty to his part in the conspiracy, played a key role in helping federal prosecutors unravel an ISIL plot to recruit at least a dozen young people from Minnesota's large Somali community to join the extremist group's fight in Syria and Iraq.\n\nYusuf, the first to plead guilty, took part in an experimental jihadi rehabilitation program and was expected to get the lightest sentence. Davis also ordered Yusuf to spend the next year in a Minneapolis halfway house.\n\nU.S. Attorney Andrew Luger noted Yusuf's cooperation.\n\n\"The hard work of rehabilitating those who seek to engage in ideological violence must continue,\" Luger said. \"Judge Davis recognized that fact today by a sentence for Abdullahi Yusuf that allows him to continue his rehabilitation. The United States thanks Mr. Yusuf for his cooperation.\"\n\nA second co-conspirator, Zacharia Abdurahman, 21, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and a third man, Abdiriza Warsame, was sentenced Monday to 30 months in prison, followed by 20 years of supervised release. Warsame, 21, has been in custody for nearly a year.\n\nSix others who pleaded guilty or were convicted in the plot are scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nWarsame, who also cooperated with prosecutors, told the judge that he's \"done some horrible things,\" but that he now wants to work against radical extremism.\n\n\"I know what it's like to be manipulated and tricked,\" Warsame said, according to KARE-TV.\n\nProsecutors are seeking the toughest sentences for three members of the plot \u2013 Abdirahman Yasin Daud, Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, and Guled Ali Omar \u2013 who were convicted in June by a jury for their part in the conspiracy.\n\nYusuf and Warsame testified that the group intended to travel to Syria where they all expected to kill on behalf of ISIL.\n\nProsecutors also used secret recordings made by a paid FBI informant to help make their case. In the recordings, the defendants and others in the conspiracy could be heard talking brashly about ISIL and plotting how to make their way to Syria to join the terror organization.\n\nTwo other men that were part of the group, Abdi Nur and Yusuf Jama, traveled successfully to Syria without getting caught. Nur, who is believed to still be in Syria, has been charged in the case; authorities believe Jama was killed in the fighting.\n\nDuring the trial, an FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force officer testified that a relative of Nur from Minnesota, Mohamad Roble, also had travelled to Syria in October 2014.

Most involved election administration issues that have plagued the polls for decades, however, rather than incidents of voter fraud or intimidation fueled by Trump's warning of a \"rigged\" election.\n\nA coalition of more than 100 civil rights and voting rights groups running a national election protection hotline reported that 40% of its calls came from African American and Hispanic communities, a possible indication that minority voters were being targeted. The majority of complaints came from California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, with Florida seeing particularly high levels of voter misinformation.\n\n\"There is tremendous disruption at the polls today,\" said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \"This election may be the most chaotic election \u2026 in the last 50 years.\"\n\nThe most widespread problems appeared to occur in North Carolina and Colorado, two crucial swing states:\n\nJudith Browne Dianis, co-director of the Advancement Project, a civil rights group, said the Durham problem \"makes for the perfect storm of a contested election\" following a dispute over legislative voting restrictions struck down in federal court. \"It's going to be the battleground of the battleground,\" she said.\n\nWhile violence generally was limited to pushing and shoving at a few polling places, a fatal California shooting near a polling location in Azusa, part of Los Angeles County, left several more people injured, scattered voters and forced a lockdown. Officials diverted voters to other polling places where they could use provisional ballots.The incident did not appear to have any connection to the election, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.\n\nFrancisco Vargas, 20, had just started to fill out his first presidential ballot. \"I was actually voting when we heard the gunshots,\" he said. At least 40 people were trapped inside, along with a dozen preschoolers getting a tour of the facility. \"It was just a really, really intense first-time voting \u2014 a fitting end to a crazy presidential election.\"\n\nWhile racial and ethnic minorities had felt threatened by Trump's calls for self-styled poll watchers, few examples of blatant discrimination were reported. In Ohio, the eligibility of some black voters was challenged at the polls, according to voting rights groups. Voters in a heavily Somalian-born community who had conflicting addresses were told to use provisional ballots when none were available; signs posted in black neighborhoods warned that voter fraud is a crime.\n\nAnd in one of the few glitches with political overtones, a problem with the calibration of electronic voting machines in Lebanon County, Pa., caused about a half dozen machines to display what voters thought were straight Republican tickets as straight Democratic tickets. Poll workers alerted the county elections bureau, and voters were able to change their ballots, said Michael Anderson, director of the Lebanon County Bureau of Elections.\n\nDisputes and lawsuits\n\nNearly 90 million Americans were expected to vote Tuesday, in addition to more than 46 million who voted early or by absentee ballot. Voters were being watched by thousands of federal monitors, voting rights advocates, conservative watchdogs and even international observers looking for anything from dirty tricks to acts of violence.\n\nLiberal and conservative interest groups were being extra vigilant because the presidential race tightened in recent days, and because Trump urged supporters to watch polling stations in \"certain areas\" for signs of fraud. Much of the back-and-forth involved liberal groups seeking to ensure that voters were given the right to cast ballots, and conservatives trying to limit access.\n\nThe Trump campaign went to court in Nevada on Tuesday, complaining that the Clark County Registrar kept an early voting site at a Latino market open two hours past closing time last Friday night. State law allows voters in line when polls close to cast ballots; Trump's lawsuit claims additional voters were allowed to join the line. The complaint, which could ultimately invalidate the votes in question, was swiftly denied.\n\n\"To approve an extraordinary writ like this is going to require an extraordinary reason,\" said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research and a former Justice Department voting rights lawyer. \"Trump's lawyers didn't show that.\"\n\nProblems were anticipated throughout the day, particularly in Southern states freed under a 2013 Supreme Court ruling from needing federal clearance for changes in voting procedures. Fourteen states with new election laws, from Arizona to New Hampshire, also were expected to encounter difficulties.\n\nKaren Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, said last-minute polling place changes and other problems in Arizona were \"causing real confusion for many voters.\"\n\n\"This is an election cycle that's just been marked by evidence of the resurgence of voting discrimination,'' said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which oversees the election protection effort. \"This is a moment when we're seeing first-hand the impact of the Supreme Court's ruling which gutted the Voting Rights Act.''\n\nObservers came from as far as Europe and South America to see whether America's democratic system could withstand pressures from within the political system and beyond \u2014 extending, perhaps, to efforts by Russia and others to hack into election information systems.\n\nVoting machines fail\n\nThe most persistent problems were those that crop up every election cycle, such as closed or relocated polling stations, confusion over new voting requirements, and faulty voting machines. Those and other problems led to long lines in North Carolina and Texas during the popular early voting that preceded Tuesday's balloting.\n\nBy mid-afternoon Tuesday, problems being reported included long lines and delayed poll openings in New York; malfunctioning voting machines in Virginia; and confusion with closed or delayed-opening polling places in Georgia and Texas. Among the specific incidents:\n\nStill waiting for a working machine at precinct 134 in #Detroit to tabulate votes. Some have handed ballots in. 30+ are waiting\u2014 Brent Snavely (@BrentSnavely) November 8, 2016\n\nCourt battles\n\nUntil Tuesday, most of the battles had been fought in federal courtrooms rather than the streets. The Supreme Court weighed in Monday, denying efforts by Democrats to bar Trump's supporters from polling places in Ohio over the chance they would intimidate voters. Conservatives previously won an Arizona legal battle over how ballots are collected, while liberals prevailed in voting rights lawsuits in North Carolina and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Justice Department dispatched more than 500 monitors to 28 states, a reduction from nearly 800 in 2012 that reduced the government's presence inside polling places. Their task: to determine whether voters were subjected to racial discrimination or other barriers related to language differences or disabilities.\n\nFederal authorities have said the decentralized and antiquated nature of the country's vote tabulation systems would be difficult to hack, and on Tuesday they said no serious issues had been reported. But the Department of Homeland Security, FBI and other agencies were focused on potential Internet outages or terrorist plots timed to the election that might be designed to sow fear.\n\nThe election protection coalition of civil right and voting rights groups claimed to have more than 4,500 volunteers fielding calls to 866-OUR-VOTE at its command center in Washington, D.C., and regional centers across the country. It also had poll monitors in 28 states.\n\nAnd in an unprecedented effort to monitor the voting process, more than 1,000 reporters, editors and students collaborated to spot and verify reports of long lines, voter intimidation and other polling place problems.\n\nThe USA TODAY Network is part of that effort, along with ProPublica, Google News Lab, Univision Noticias, the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism, First Draft, and WNYC Radio. The information is being published on the Electionland website and used in separate stories.\n\nEarly Tuesday, Electionland reported that Urban Outfitters, a popular retailer with conservative ownership, tweeted incorrectly to its 1 million Twitter followers that voters must bring voting registration cards to their polling places. The company said it would correct the voter guide immediately.\n\nSeveral other issues Tuesday focused on Trump and his family:\n\nWhat an amazing moment to cast a vote for my father.

Gen. Matthew Isler, a coalition official, said in an interview from Baghdad.\n\nU.S. commanders expect the success in eastern Mosul to be repeated as forces cross the Tigris River into western Mosul, where the militants remain dug in.\n\nStill, they acknowledge that clearing the rest of Iraq's second-largest city \u2014 the militants' last major stronghold in the country \u2014 will be difficult.

Joe Martin, a coalition commander in Baghdad, told Pentagon reporters. He said that he was confident Iraqi forces would prevail.\n\nThe United Nations estimates there are 750,000 civilians remaining in the city's west side, which makes airstrikes difficult. Plus the militants have had more than two years to prepare elaborate defenses, such as tunnels and bunkers.\n\nIt's not clear how many militants are left in Mosul. The Pentagon initially estimated there were 3,000 to 5,000, but that number includes fighters who were later killed in the three-month-old offensive to recapture the city. \"They lost a big chunk of that,\" said Air Force Col. John Dorrian, a military spokesman in Baghdad.\n\nEven small groups of fighters can inflict damage if they are in defensive positions and willing to fight to the death. The city is largely surrounded and the militants have no way to escape.\n\n\"They realize this is the final episode of their existence in Iraq,\" said Ismael Alsodani, a retired Iraqi brigadier general.\n\nThe Iraqi military's success in eastern Mosul came after Dec. 29, when it relaunched an offensive after a week-long pause to reassess tactics and resupply units. The Iraqis used the time to shift forces and improve coordination among units, and the coalition increased the number of advisers with Iraqi units by about 40 to 450.\n\nThe renewed attack from multiple directions caught militants by surprise and Islamic State defenses quickly collapsed. \"That's when the tempo really increased,\" Martin said.\n\nAs the militants scrambled, coalition airstrikes pounded them.\n\nThe increased airstrikes and new defensive tactics employed by Iraqi ground units has helped lessen the threat posed by car bombs, one of the militants' most effective weapons.\n\nThe militants are having trouble finding suicide bombers to drive the vehicles: Some drivers have abandoned explosive-laden cars before reaching Iraqi units.\n\nMilitants tried to flee the east of the city as Iraqi forces advanced, but those who attempted to escape eastern Mosul on boats were hit by airstrikes, which targeted more than 150 vessels.\n\nThe boats were the only escape route after airstrikes disabled five bridges that span the Tigris. That kept militants on the west side from coming to the aid of fighters in eastern Mosul.\n\nIslamic State leaders fled first, followed by foreign fighters, leaving local Iraqis to fight advancing Iraqi forces, Isler said.\n\nIsler said he watched surveillance video as the remaining fighters, two groups of about 14 armed men, attempted to flee on Tuesday as Iraqi forces closed in.\n\n\"They got to the edge of the river and looked south for boats,\" he said. No boats came to their rescue. The larger group was hit with a precision bomb and the smaller group was targeted with a hellfire missile, he said.\n\n\"At that point they were done,\" Isler said. That day Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared the east of the city liberated.\n\nA revised battle plan was needed because the offensive had slowed, said Emily Anagnostos, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, D.C.\n\nSome of the newly formed Iraqi units lacked fighting experience and coordinating a force of 100,000 is difficult. \"It was clear there needed to be shift,\" she said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.347826004028319, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 689, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 16, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.55453638177, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170130200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.35413642960813, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/09/senate-probe-concludes-sex-website-knowingly-concealed-evidence-criminality/96371222/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 732, "scraper_regex": 822}}, "headline": "Senate probe concludes sex website 'knowingly concealed evidence of criminality'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 822, "date": "20170110010000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Senate investigation into child-sex trafficking has uncovered evidence that employees of a major sex advertising website deleted incriminating evidence from ads posted on its site \u2014 allegedly helping to conceal illegal activity, rather than reporting it to authorities.\n\nThe website, Backpage.com, used a filter that automatically stripped out words that would have revealed a child was being sold for sex\u2014terms such as \"Lolita,\" \"amber alert,\" \"fresh,\" and \"school girl,\" according to a report issued Monday by a Senate investigative panel. Then employees would post the edited ad in its adult section.\n\n\"Backpage has knowingly concealed evidence of criminality by systematically editing its 'adult' ads,\" the report states. \"At the direction of CEO Carl Ferrer, the company programmed this electronic filter to 'strip'\u2014that is, delete\u2014hundreds of words indicative of sex trafficking (including child sex trafficking) or prostitution from ads before their publication.\"\n\nLiz McDougall, general counsel for Backpage.com, did not immediately respond to a voicemail and email seeking comment. But Dale Leibach, who said he was acting as a spokesman, issued a statement after 9 p.m. Monday night saying that due to \"government censorship,\" Backpage had removed its adult content section from its sites.\n\n\"This will not end the fight for online freedom of speech,\" Leibach's statement said. \"Backpage.com will continue to pursue its efforts in court to vindicate its First Amendment rights and those of other online platforms for third party expression.\"\n\nAfter the statement was released, however, the site still included sex ads in its adult section, including more than a dozen in one city alone describing themselves as \"young.\"\n\nBackpage is involved in 73% of all child trafficking reports that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children receives from the general public, the report says, adding that the site has been called a \"hub\" of \"human trafficking, especially the trafficking of minors\" by law enforcement officials.\n\nMore than 400 cases of child sex trafficking across 47 states have been linked to the website \u2014 including at least 13 in Ohio and six in Missouri over the last several years. Those figures stem from a probe, launched in 2015 by Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who lead the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs' investigatory subcommittee. Portman is the chairman, and McCaskill is the ranking Democrat.\n\nIn its Monday report, the subcommittee found:\n\n*Employees would manually edit out red-flag words that the filter did not catch, including terms that hinted at criminal activity, such as \"teen\" and \"young.\"\n\n*Under direction from Ferrer, the company's CEO, employees \"coached\" its users to \"clean ads\" to hide evidence of child sex-trafficking. \"For example, in 2012, a user advertising sex with a 'teen' would get the error message: 'Sorry, 'teen' is a banned term'.\" By redrafting the ad, the user would then be permitted to post \"a sanitized version.\"\n\n*Backpage.com employees were aware that prostitution was occurring through the site and may have intentionally under-reported instances of that to authorities.\n\n\" \u2026 A former moderator, told Subcommittee staff that all employees involved in adult moderation knew that the ads they reviewed offered sex for money,\" the report says. \"According to her, moderators 'went through the motions of putting lipstick on a pig, because when it came down to it, it was what the business was about'\u2014that is, moderating ads for prostitution.\"\n\nThe report says that even when Backpage officials identified a case of child exploitation, they may have limited the number of reports sent to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. In an email, one executive wrote: \"If we don't want to blow past 500 [reports] this month, we shouldn't be doing more than 16 a day. [W]e can't ignore the ones that seem like trouble but if we start counting now it might help us on the ones where we're being liberal with moderator reports.\"\n\nPortman and McCaskill have called the CEO and other top executives at Backpage.com to testify at a hearing on Tuesday. It's not clear if those officials will answer the senators' questions or if they will plead the 5th amendment against self-incrimination. At a 2015 hearing, Ferrer defied a committee subpoena requiring him to appear before the panel.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities in various states have tried to crack down on Backpage.com. Ferrer and two other top employees were arrested last fall; Ferrer was charged with pimping a minor, pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping, while his deputies were charged with conspiracy to commit pimping.\n\nA California judge dismissed those charges in early December, saying the federal Communications Decency Act protects free speech and gives the website operators immunity for content posted by users.\n\nBut California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who since has taken office as a U.S. senator, refiled charges in late December against Ferrer and two other executives. They were charged with 13 counts of pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping. They also are charged with 26 counts of money laundering.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.745721340179441, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 732, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 7, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.38452309975, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.55191256830601, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/22/94275678/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 719, "scraper_regex": 905}}, "headline": "Tears turn to anger in Chattanooga as school bus crash probe continues", "wordcount_as_scraped": 905, "date": "20161122180000", "story_content": "CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. \u2014 Families grappled on Tuesday to find a way forward after a bus crash that killed five students at Woodmore Elementary School, but lingering questions about the driver added another layer of pain to the grief.\n\nThe bus veered off of Talley Road in Chattanooga at such a speed Monday afternoon that it wrapped around a tree and was almost torn in half. Wreckers hauled the mangled bus away from the crash site Tuesday morning, with a large blue tarp draped over the middle section that had been crushed.\n\nThe aftershocks of the violent wreck gripped many throughout the Brainerd area, the state and the nation. Melanie Hillian, who heard the explosive crash from her nearby home, ran into the chaos.\n\nAt first, she wanted to believe the children's screams were playful, but the true horror of the situation set in when she saw the bloodied children lying in the leaves near the bus.\n\nHillian knelt next to a boy who was barely breathing and tried to feel for his pulse while they waited for an ambulance to come. On Tuesday, she wondered aloud if he was among the dead, and if she could have done anything more to save him.\n\n\"His little body was kind of tangled,\" she said. \"It just keeps playing over and over and over in my head.\"\n\nOutside of Woodmore Elementary and throughout the Brainerd area, several parents were left to ponder how the tragedy even came to be, although the ongoing investigation by federal, state and local authorities offered few early answers. Some voiced their anger at the Hamilton County school district and the bus driver, Johnthony Walker, who was arrested and charged with five counts of vehicular homicide. Court documents said Walker, 24, was weaving down the 30 mph road at a \"very high speed.\"\n\n\"It could have happened to anybody's kids. It could have been anybody,\" said Lamar Sharpe, a man with two sons in another Hamilton County school. \"I told my kids they're car riders today and for the rest of the year.\"\n\nSharpe acknowledged the realities of his work schedule would mean the kids would have to return to school buses eventually, but he hoped that by the time they did, Hamilton County would have stricter standards for its bus drivers.\n\nLowenstein Smith, who said her grandson had been injured in the crash, came by Woodmore Tuesday morning where she milled and chatted with other family members. She said her grandson had complained about the driver's speeding before, but that those complaints were not taken seriously by the school system.\n\nHamilton County Interim Superintendent Kirk Kelly did not give any details about Walker's track record with the school system, saying only that he worked for a private company that oversaw buses for Hamilton County. Walker was involved in an earlier bus accident in September, police said.\n\nDemetrius Jenkins said he had planned to let his 6-year-old son ride the bus to Woodmore starting next year. Monday's tragedy put those plans on hold indefinitely.\n\n\"It's not safe anymore,\" he said. \"It's not safe.\"\n\nThat sense of foreboding colored much of the day at the elementary school, where the familiar laughter of the schoolyard was replaced by nervous quiet. Children held tight to their parent's hands on their way into school and said nothing as television cameras hovered on the periphery of the campus just six miles southeast of downtown Chattanooga.\n\nSnippet of my interview with Demetrius Jenkins, who walked his 6yo son to school this morning pic.twitter.com/FwTpNLHZGL\u2014 Adam Tamburin (@tamburintweets) November 22, 2016\n\nMany of the parents and guardians who walked students to Woodmore on Tuesday said they had struggled to talk with the children about the crash that killed their classmates and injured many more.\n\n\"You can't explain nothing like this,\" Doris Toney said after dropping her niece off. \"I don't even know what to say to her.\"\n\nJenkins had yet to discuss the crash with his son. Speaking to reporters outside the school, Jenkins said one of his son's friends was among the dead.\n\n\"I don't know how he would react,\" Jenkins said. \"He's not so familiar with death.\n\n\"He's going to eventually find out because we will be at the funeral.\"\n\nAt a loss for what to do next, Jenkins reached into his car before leaving the school. He pulled out two teddy bears and leaned them against the empty flagpole. Moments later, officials came out to raise a flag to half staff.\n\nKelly said that of the 37 children on the bus, five students \u2014 a kindergartner, a first grader and three 4th graders \u2014 were killed in the crash. Twelve children remain hospitalized Tuesday morning.\n\nChattanooga Mayor Andy Berke called said the crash represented \"an unimaginable loss\" for five families and the city as a whole.\n\n\"The most unnatural thing in the world is for a parent to mourn the loss of a child,\" Burke said.\n\nAccording to an arrest affidavit, Walker, the school bus driver, was going at a high speed when the bus crashed.\n\nThe affidavit, which was posted online by Chattanooga television station WTVC, stated that Walker was driving well above the posted speed limit of 30 mph Monday afternoon when the bus left the narrow, winding road and eventually struck a tree.\n\nWalker was arrested and has been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, along with reckless driving and reckless endangerment.

Her lawsuit alleges Maury County Sheriff Bucky Rowland illegally denied her access to an abortion, which the nation's top court has protected as a woman's right for decades.\n\nThe case, and others around the country, pose questions about what obligations top law enforcement officers have when women who are incarcerated request abortions.\n\n\"Courts have generally said prisoners retain their right to access abortion even if they're incarcerated,\" said Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney for the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project.\n\nBut there's still some gray area, including on questions of who has to pay and whether a judge's order is necessary, because each case is different and presents different circumstances for a judge to consider. Also, the U.S. Supreme Court has not weighed in.\n\n\"The U.S. Supreme Court has not spoken on this issue, so we don't have a definitive answer on some of these questions,\" Amiri said. \"Because different cases raise different facts, it's a little bit of a patchwork.\"\n\nMore than 10 years ago, in a controversial Knoxville, Tenn., case, a federal judge allowed an inmate temporary release to get an abortion, saying the woman had a constitutional right to the procedure. And in 2008 the nation's top court let stand a ruling out of Arizona that overturned a county policy banning off-site elective procedures.\n\nAmiri and the ACLU brought that legal challenge in Arizona. The national civil rights organization is not involved in the pending case against Maury County.\n\nA highly publicized case in 2015 in Alabama detailed a sheriff's refusal to allow a 29-year-old inmate to have the procedure, saying she needed a court order. The ensuing legal battle ended in federal court when the woman decided to keep the child, according to media reports.\n\nCathey was arrested in July 2015 on robbery and murder conspiracy charges and found out weeks later she was pregnant, according to the lawsuit. Police records from Columbia, Tenn., say she and three others lured Javontay Garrett to a home to steal drugs and money and then shot him. Garrett lived despite the head wound, said Brent Cooper, the district attorney in Maury and three other counties.\n\nWeeks later Cathey told Rowland, via her lawyer, that she wanted to have an abortion, but Rowland responded that he would not provide funding or transportation for the procedure, the lawsuit states. Rowland said that would not happen unless the abortion was \"medically necessary to save the mother's life or the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe sheriff did not return an email and several calls seeking comment, and the county has not yet responded to the lawsuit. In an email Tuesday, Cathey's lawyer, Lee Brooks, said he is unable to comment on the pending case.\n\nBrooks said in the lawsuit he attempted to get a lower bond, but by the time Cathey was able to post that amount it was January 2016 and too late to have the procedure. The lawsuit does not say whether Cathey also asked a judge to allow her release; a court clerk said no such motion was in the court file.\n\nThe child was born about three months after Cathey was able to post bond and was released, according to the lawsuit. According to the Tennessee Department of Corrections, she is no longer in custody and is serving a sentence of probation until 2022.\n\nThe case was filed Dec. 29 in federal court in Nashville. It argues that the sheriff's denial, and his failure to have department policies that allowed access to abortions, inflicted cruel and unusual punishment on Cathey in violation of her Eighth Amendment rights. It also says Cathey's civil rights and 14th Amendment rights to due process were violated.\n\nCathey wants a judge to order the sheriff and Maury County\n\nNow, she wants a judge to order the sheriff and Maury County to pay her $1.5 million in damages.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.02577304840088, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 691, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.73332661425, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.61794500723589, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/13/donald-trump-class-rural-white-democrats-glenn-reynolds-column/96413412/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 840, "scraper_regex": 519}}, "headline": "Oikophobia on the rise after Trump win: Glenn Reynolds", "wordcount_as_scraped": 519, "date": "20170113140000", "story_content": "How crazy has the reaction to Trump's impending presidency gotten? So crazy that Democratic operatives are scared of plumbers, and I don't mean the Watergate kind.\n\nNo, really. Ned Resnikoff, a \"senior editor\" at the liberal website ThinkProgress, wrote on Facebook that he'd called a plumber to fix a clogged drain. The plumber showed up, did the job and left, but Resnikoff was left shaken, though with a functioning drain. Wrote Resnikoff, \"He was a perfectly nice guy and a consummate professional. But he was also a middle-aged white man with a Southern accent who seemed unperturbed by this week's news.\"\n\nThis created fear: \"While I had him in the apartment, I couldn't stop thinking about whether he had voted for Trump, whether he knew my last name is Jewish, and how that knowledge might change the interaction we were having inside my own home.\"\n\nWhen it was all over, Resnikoff reported that he was \"rattled\" at the thought that a Trump supporter might have been in his home. \"I couldn't shake the sense of potential danger.\"\n\nWell. When people have irrational, exaggerated fears we call them phobias. We heard a lot during this year's immigration debate about \"xenophobia,\" an exaggerated or irrational fear of foreigners. But this plumber wasn't a foreigner. He was an American with an American regional accent who thought the American election had turned out okay. What do you call the irrational fear of an American, by an American?\n\nRoger Scruton coined the term \"oikophobia\" (from the Greed oikos for \"home\") to describe the fear of one's fellow countrymen. And there seems to be rather a lot of it among the gentry liberals who make up America's ruling class.\n\nIn fact, another piece on reacting to the election, by Tim Kreider in The Week, is titled \"I love America. It's Americans I hate.\" Writes Kreider, \"The public is a swarm of hostile morons, I told her. You don't need to make them understand you; you just need to defeat them, or wait for them die. . . . A few of us are talking, after a couple drinks, about buying guns; if it comes to a fascist state or civil war, we figure, we don't want the red states to be the only ones armed.\"\n\n\"A vote for Trump,\" Kreider continues, \"is kind of like a murder.\" Though his piece concludes on a (slightly) more hopeful note, the point is clear: Americans, at least Trump-voting Americans, are \"pathetically dumb and gullible, uncritical consumers of any disinformation that confirms their biases.\"\n\nAngelo Codevilla wrote in 2010: \"Its attitude is key to understanding our bipartisan ruling class. Its first tenet is that 'we' are the best and brightest while the rest of Americans are retrograde, racist, and dysfunctional unless properly constrained.\" Most ruling classes think that sort of thing about the ruled, of course, but as Codevilla notes, it sits poorly with American notions of equality.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.04259634017944, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 840, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.6316572411099997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113140000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.2619047619047596, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/01/27/arkansas-abortion/97134562/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Arkansas bans second-trimester abortion procedure; ACLU calls ban unconstitutional", "wordcount_as_scraped": 496, "date": "20170127170000", "story_content": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

Asa Hutchinson signed into law a measure banning the procedure known as dilation and evacuation, which abortion-rights supporters contend is the safest and most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions. Hutchinson signed the bill hours after it was approved by the majority-GOP Senate on a 25-6 vote. It won't take effect until later this year.\n\nHutchinson, who had promised abortion opponents earlier this week he would sign the ban into law, didn't issue a statement after approving the measure. Arkansas Right to Life has called the prohibition its top legislative priority in Arkansas, and the group's president has called the procedure \"barbaric.\"\n\n\"I think this is a humane bill. ...

David Sanders, who co-sponsored the measure, told lawmakers before the vote.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas says the measure is unconstitutional.\n\n\"It's an empty gesture that's going to cost the state tens of thousands of dollars in litigation fees and costs,\" said Rita Sklar, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas.\n\nSimilar bans are in effect in Mississippi and West Virginia. Bans in Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma have been put on hold due to legal challenges.\n\nThe procedure was used in 683 of the 3,771 abortions performed in Arkansas in 2015, according to the state Department of Health.\n\nThe Arkansas law will take effect 90 days after the Legislature formally adjourns its 2017 session, which usually occurs in April or May.\n\nThe ban is among a push by abortion opponents nationally and at statehouses around the country with Republicans in control of the White House and Congress. One of President Donald Trump's first acts since taking office has been to massively expand the ban on providing federal money to international family planning groups that perform abortions or provide abortion information. Trump has said he plans on filling a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court with an abortion opponent.\n\nRepublicans also expanded their majorities in both chambers of the Arkansas Legislature and are expected to consider further restrictions on abortion procedures. They include a proposal that would require that doctors provide care to an infant born in a failed abortion attempt.\n\nThe ban on dilation and evacuation was approved on a mostly party-line vote, with three of the Senate's nine Democrats joining Republicans to support the proposal. The majority-GOP House approved the bill earlier this week along similar lines.\n\n\"It's as if we want to practice medicine, and if we do, I think we should all go to medical school and become doctors,\" Democratic Sen. Joyce Elliott, who opposed the bill, said after the vote. \"Saying we're going to outlaw something because we disagree with the procedure, that is a medical procedure, is something we just can't get seem to our heads around.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.21052646636963, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 515, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.2305171175200003, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.3009708737864103, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/22/reservations-rex-our-view/96633258/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 671, "scraper_regex": 592}}, "headline": "Reservations about Rex: Our view", "wordcount_as_scraped": 592, "date": "20170122230000", "story_content": "Rex Tillerson has much to commend him as his nomination to become secretary of State comes up for a vote Monday in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Tillerson displayed considerable achievement by rising to become chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest and most successful companies. He knows leaders around the globe.\n\nHe has the backing of some well-respected foreign policy experts; on Sunday, he picked up important support from Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham. Tillerson was a better choice than the bombastic John Bolton and Rudy Giuliani, who Donald Trump also considered for State. And, at 64, Tillerson deserves credit for agreeing to delay a cushy retirement for the rigors of public service.\n\nYet there are also several reasons for reservations about Trump's choice for one of the most important national security posts. Like Trump, Tillerson is a wealthy businessman who never served a day in government. If confirmed, he would be tasked with navigating the United States through increasingly treacherous foreign policy shoals, which requires different skills than negotiating oil deals.\n\nTillerson's rocky, day-long testimony before the Foreign Relations panel revealed causes for concern.. In his opening remarks, Tillerson, a former national president of the Boy Scouts of America, endorsed a U.S. foreign policy emphasizing moral leadership and invoked his personal commitment to the Scout creed of acting \"on my honor.\" But during the question-and-answer sessions, he repeatedly expressed caution when it came to criticizing some of the world's most flagrant examples of human rights violations.\n\nHe declined comment about the thousands slaughtered in Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's ruthless war on drugs, and when asked Russia's merciless bombing of civilians in Syria, Tillerson managed only an understated \"that is not acceptable behavior.\" His muted response on Russia was especially disconcerting because of concerns about Tillerson's close ties to Moscow and Trump's obsequiousness toward President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBy comparison, Tillerson was alarmingly hawkish about China's occupation of disputed reefs in the South China Sea where artificial islands have been built. A firmer response to China's actions is appropriate, but Tillerson advocated sending China \"a clear signal that first, the island building stops, and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.\" Is he proposing a military blockade? Tillerson's response sounded very much like fighting words, not like someone who wants to be the nation's chief diplomat.\n\nPerhaps most troubling was how Tilllerson seemed to walk back his widely publicized concerns about global warming, views many thought would be important within a Trump cabinet filled with with so many climate-change skeptics. The former fossil fuel executive disagreed that climate change is a major national security risk, in contrast to a position held by the Department of Defense. And when it came to the Paris Agreement to limit global carbon emissions, Tillerson's answers were little more than rote. At least five times he repeated how the U.S. must keep \"a seat at the table,\" not necessarily to provide leadership on climate issues but more parochially to ensure America doesn't sacrifice more than anyone else.\n\nTo his credit, Tillerson did draw some important distinctions with Trump, supporting the NATO alliance (which Trump has suggested is obsolete) and favoring a Pacific trade agreement that the new president opposes as part of his protectionist, \"America First\" worldview.\n\nIn fact, if Tillerson is confirmed, as appears likely after Sunday's McCain-Graham announcement, his true test is likely to be his ability to push back simultaneously against foreign adversaries and the ill-considered foreign policy demands of his erratic boss.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.9280205965042099, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 671, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.9317300902900003, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 9, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170122230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.32190760059613, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/10/analysis-president-obama-farewell-address/96386130/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1166, "scraper_regex": 1085}}, "headline": "Analysis: Keep hope alive?

His hair was grayer, his tone more somber. And since election night 2016, his message has been aimed at rallying downcast supporters and defending a legacy that his successor has vowed to dismantle.\n\nIn his speech, he recited a litany of his proudest achievements, among them the economic recovery from the Great Recession, the diplomatic outreach to Cuba, the nuclear accord with Iran, the death of Osama bin Laden, the extension of health care coverage to 20 million people and more.\n\n\"That's what we did,\" he said to cheers. \"That's what you did. You were the change. Because of you, by almost every measure, America is a stronger, better place than it was when we started.\"\n\nStill, while Obama is finishing his term with a healthy approval rating \u2014 ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's standing by double digits in a Quinnipiac University Poll released Tuesday \u2014 the election of a political nemesis as his successor poses grave risks to what he leaves behind on everything from health care to climate change.\n\nThe situation includes this ironic twist: Trump initially built a political following by questioning Obama's birthplace and the legitimacy of his presidency. Now, as he prepares to turn over the White House to Trump, Obama finds himself defending the legitimacy of Trump's presidency, insisting to skeptics that the election of this new commander in chief doesn't represent an apocalypse that threatens American democracy.\n\nHe quieted boos from the audience when he noted that a new administration would over in 10 days, lauding \"the peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to the next.\"\n\nWhen the crowd chanted \"Four more years!\" to drown out a protester, he said with a smile, \"I can't do that.\"\n\nObama was speaking amid a new and potentially explosive controversy involving Trump. CNN first reported, and USA TODAY and other news outlets confirmed, that Obama and Trump last week were given classified documents that included unverified allegations from Russian operatives who claimed to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump. The president-elect denounced the report in a tweet, deriding it as \"#fakenews.\"\n\nObama's decision to deliver a farewell address, and the unprecedented venue he chose for it, is part of his effort to make the case for his legacy and rally his reeling party. He is all too aware of the impact Hillary Clinton's defeat in November is likely to have on his legacy, one reason he and Michelle Obama campaigned so fiercely on her behalf.\n\nIt wasn't just a matter of timing, though. Reagan's impact endured in part because he was succeeded in the Oval Office by his vice president, George H.W. Bush, who articulated his own message but also helped cement Reagan policies.\n\nNow Obama will be succeeded by a new president elected with a promise to repeal Affordable Care Act, reject the Pacific trade accord, withdraw from the global climate-change agreement, undo the Iran nuclear deal and reverse his executive orders on immigration and the environment.\n\nConsider the comments by a senior Trump adviser in an interview with USA TODAY Monday about Obama's farewell address. \"It's a great idea for him to do this,\" Kellyanne Conway said, \"because he knows that a great deal of what he did is not going to survive this next presidency, or maybe even this next month, in some cases.\"\n\nThere has been an accelerating sense of time running out for the Obama team as attention shifts to Trump. During coverage Tuesday of Senate confirmation hearings for Trump's nominees for attorney general and Homeland Security secretary, MSNBC and CNN displayed countdown clocks in a corner of the TV screen, ticking off the hours until Obama's final big speech.\n\nObama didn't directly criticize Trump, but he did pointedly declare his position on issues that divide them.\n\n\"Democracy can buckle when we give in to fear,\" he cautioned. \"So just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are. ... That's why we've ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, and reform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties. That's why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans.\"\n\nWashington, Andrew Jackson and Andrew Johnson delivered farewell addresses in writing. Close to a century later, Harry Truman revived the tradition with a televised address, followed by Dwight Eisenhower, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.\n\nNo previous president chose to deliver it to a huge hometown audience and in a venue that echoed the biggest campaign celebrations.\n\nHis speech was conversational and personal, citing both progress made during his tenure and problems that remain. That included issues of race that predictably persisted despite his groundbreaking election as the first African American elected to the White House. He faulted members of both parties for living in \"bubbles\" that make understanding and action more difficult on the most intractable problems. \"If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try to talk with one in real life,\" he said to laughter.\n\nAgain and again, he called on American citizens to participate in their democracy.\n\n\"Our Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift,\" he said. \"But it's really just a piece of parchment. It has no power on its own. We, the people, give it power, with our participation and the choices we make \u2014 whether or not we stand up for our freedoms, whether or not we respect and enforce the rule of law. America is no fragile thing. But the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.\"\n\nIn the speech in 2008, Obama called for moving beyond partisan divides. \"Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long,\" he told the crowd.\n\nBut in his address Tuesday night, he was addressing a nation with divisions that have only gotten deeper and angrier.\n\nAnd on Wednesday morning, the president-elect is slated to grab the spotlight as he held his first formal news conference as president-elect while the Senate is scheduled to begin voting to repeal Obamacare.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.384615391492844, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1166, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.32941123629, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.57289879931389, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/11/16/trump-trade-war-china-russia-column/93889784/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "The world will take Trump literally: Column", "wordcount_as_scraped": 919, "date": "20161116170000", "story_content": "It is a testament to Donald Trump's political skills that his supporters were never deterred by his regular excesses and reversals. In an effort to classify this phenomenon, Trump explainers claim that the experts missed this moment because they demanded specificity and facts from the president-elect in a way his devotees did not.\n\n\"The press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally,\" Salena Zito wrote in The Atlantic, distilling why Trump's appeal was so strong and why so many professionals missed it.\n\nBut though Trump supporters may possess a remarkable capacity to suspend disbelief, the rest of the world will not be so forgiving. As the commander in chief of the armed forces and guarantor of the post-war geopolitical order, every statement out of Trump's mouth will be taken quite literally by both America's allies and adversaries.\n\nThe foundation of deterrence is a clear and unequivocal understanding of what interests a nation will fight to defend. Vagueness in the realm of statecraft leads revisionist powers to test their parameters and, in so doing, risk overreaching and miscalculation. That's how wars start.\n\nWe don't have to go diving into the deepest recesses of history to support the contention that U.S. presidents must say what they mean and mean what they say. President Obama drew a red line over the prospect of Syrian President Bashar Assad deploying chemical weapons against civilians, but Obama's bluff was called and the world saw him blink. The following years were typified by aggressive nations testing Washington's commitment to defending the status quo.\n\nNot since World War II has a European power invaded and summarily annexed neighboring territory, but that's what an emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin did in 2014. This brazen test of the Western powers that had guaranteed Ukrainian territorial integrity occurred only after Obama leaned on Moscow to save him from himself by negotiating the surrender of Assad's chemical stockpiles. In the end, Assad maintained and still uses his chemical weapons, and U.S. intervention in Syria was only delayed by a few months. Testing its freedom of action further still, Russia inaugurated military intervention on Assad's behalf last year by announcing it destroyed a CIA-provided weapons depot in Syria, exposing a previously unacknowledged black program to the world.\n\nBeijing, too, watched Obama back off his red line. When he took office, Obama dedicated himself to reorienting U.S. diplomatic and military posture toward the Asia Pacific. The \"pivot to Asia\" seemed forever on the horizon and, by 2014, was not yet manifest in the form of appreciably more U.S. naval hardware in the region. Assured of American timidity, China created territory from whole cloth in the contested South China Sea, turning man-made islands into fortresses dedicated to power projection.\n\nObama was generally prudent about the language he used when he knew that the world was listening. Yet the president's moment of incaution made for a more dangerous world. What will be the effect of a far less circumspect president tripping over his own words on a more regular basis? Trump's artless use of language has already given the West's adversaries cause to test him.\n\nWhen The New York Times asked whether he'd come to the aid of Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania in the event of a Russian incursion, Trump refused to say and added: \"We have many NATO members that aren't paying their bills.\" Yet NATO's mutual defense provisions require such a military response, and in any case Estonia is one of five NATO member states that met its 2015 requirement to spend the equivalent of 2% of GDP on defense. Trump was working backward from his predetermined conclusion that Russia should have its way in Europe. This is a signal to Russia's expansionist president, who will surely take advantage of what he perceives to be new latitude.\n\nChina is the subject of a lot of Trump's tough talk, but no state would so benefit from America's retreat from its financial obligations. The likely death of the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 a sprawling 12-member trade agreement that took eight years to negotiate \u2014 might lead to regional trade pacts that privilege Chinese and Japanese markets and don't impose the standards preferred by Washington. Anticipating that Trump meant it when he promised to ignite a \"trade war\" with China, the Pacific is pivoting unto itself. Consider also that Trump has said that South Korea and Japan might need their own nuclear weapons to protect themselves, because America can't afford it anymore. It's only smart for Asia to prepare for a post-American future.\n\nThe president-elect's supporters seem convinced that they can divine Trump's secret messages, but the rest of the world isn't interested in poring over their amateur Talmudic translations. In the cold, hard power logic of geopolitics, history hangs on the American president's every word. Being coy or offhand about U.S. security priorities can lead to the kind of miscalculations that have the potential to devolve into cascading cycles of proportionately escalating retaliation. Absent cooler heads, those cycles can spiral out of control.\n\nA president does not have the luxury of imprecise language. Trump's fans may not take his words seriously, but America's enemies most certainly will.\n\nNoah C. Rothman is the associate online editor for Commentary magazine.

But Kushner Cos. remains fully committed to redeveloping its property in Perth Amboy, and to the town,\" James Yolles, a Kushner Cos. spokesman, said late Wednesday in an emailed statement. \"Our existing plan would create a revitalized waterfront, spur investment and increase the local tax base. We're hopeful the town will work with us to make that plan a reality to the benefit of all Perth Amboy residents.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Vincent Leblon asked to meet with the plaintiffs and their attorney, Patrick Whalen, without the defendants' attorneys present. No settlement was reached and motions are expected to continue Thursday.\n\nIf the case goes to trial, the residents are looking for Charles and Jared Kushner to be called to testify. Although the Kushners have argued that they have no personal or unique knowledge about the material fact issues in dispute, Whalen, in a letter to the judge, argues that is false.\n\n\"Charles Kushner and Jared Kushner both were directly involved in The Landings project, the decision to stop marketing the project, and the cessation of all construction at The Landings,\" Whalen said in the letter. \"Further, Jared Kushner became a key principal of the Kushner defendants precisely at the time, or shortly after, the decisions were made to stop construction at The Landings, and for the Kushner defendants to shift their focus away from New Jersey and direct their business activities to New York.\"\n\nStarting in 2004, buyers purchased condos in the Landings at Harborside Bayview and Admiral buildings in what was envisioned as a $600 million luxury waterfront community designed to attract well-educated, middle-class residents from outside Perth Amboy.\n\nFormer Mayor Joseph Vas touted the project as the renaissance for the urban city. Vas, who brokered the project, is set to be released from federal prison next month after serving time on a corruption conviction.\n\nThe residents paid on average between $325,000 to $450,000 for their units, some making the purchases two years before their closings.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, in 2000, the Perth Amboy Redevelopment Agency adopted a resolution for a redevelopment agreement with Kushner Cos. for a 49-acre waterfront site called The Landings. The project called for 190,000 square feet of retail space, 2,094 residential housing units in 17 luxury buildings, include 98 townhomes, 102 row homes and nearly 1,900 low-rise and mid-rise condominiums. The housing units were to be owner-occupied.\n\nThe project also called for a hotel, a state-of-the-art health club, waterfront esplanade, cultural community center, public waterfront walkway, marina with boat slips,Gateway Festival Park and Founders Park, according to the lawsuit.\n\nEven small promises were not met, according to the suit. One resident was told she would be able to have a washer and dryer in her unit but later found the area designated for the appliances was too small and the resident has had to do without a washer and dryer since the day she moved in, the suit states.\n\nThe lawsuit states that none of the promises for the project, intended to revive the nearby neighborhoods, were honored by the defendants.\n\nThe project, with all the amenities, was scheduled for completion by 2012, but to date, only the two buildings, the Admiral and Bayview have been built. There is no waterfront park, no Founders Park, no new marina, no hotel, no shops or other businesses catering to Landings residents. Kushner Cos. suspended all construction on the Landings project in 2007.\n\n\"Defendants breached their obligations and reneged on their promises to the plaintiff. The extensive failures on the part of the defendants are easily illustrated by the fact the plaintiffs units, the common elements, and the entire planned development do not conform to the promises, representations, sales models, marketing materials, descriptions and/or plans defendants used to induce plaintiffs into entering into their purchase agreements,\" the suit states.\n\nKushner Cos. presented the city with a scaled-down design of the Landing project in 2011, one that was inconsistent with the original plans, because it included rental housing and no amenities from the original plan, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe residents are seeking the repeal of their contracts, the return of all money paid to Kushner and the other defendants, and the award of damages including the purchase price of their condo units and any extras, cost of repairs and the difference between the contract price and the value of the property as well as legal fees.\n\nIn his letter, Whalen said that Jared Kushner was running the company by 2008 and has direct knowledge as to why the Landings project was not re-started and completed, even though the company was spending billions of dollars on other acquisitions and developments.\n\n\"Again, this is a wide-scale Consumer Fraud Act case involving 33 victimized citizen consumers \u2014 some of whom have lost their life savings and/or had their retirement plans derailed,\" Whalen said in his letter. \"Is it that much to ask for the executives in charge of the corporations that failed to fulfill the promises made, and, who made the pertinent decisions to not build master common elements/amenities, to appear in court and explain to a jury why the Master Common Amenities at The Landings, promised over 13 years ago, were never built?\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.7692307829856869, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1033, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.91437275302, "HarmVirtue": 11, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.5169409486931302, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/11/02/donald-trump-apologize-speech-pride-column/92800042/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1469, "scraper_regex": 1250}}, "headline": "The speech that could have saved Trump: Mark DeMoss", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1250, "date": "20161102220000", "story_content": "My fellow Americans, early in my campaign for the Republican nomination for president, I was asked by a reporter whether I had ever felt the need to ask for God's forgiveness.

Jeb, you and your family have an admirable record of public service to our nation, and I apologize for calling you names and not showing you the respect you deserve. Please forgive me \u2014 you would have been a fine president.\n\nMitt Romney, I now know just how hard it is to run for president \u2014 and you did it twice! Please forgive me for calling you a loser and a choke artist \u2014 two labels many will no doubt place on me, should I be unsuccessful on Election Day. You, sir, exemplify class, dignity, character, integrity and faith. You are a national model of a good husband, father and grandfather. Frankly, I'm sorry we aren't all working for your re-election this year!\n\nThen, I want to apologize to the people of Mexico for painting an entire nation with the kind of broad-brush stereotype that has no place in political discourse \u2014 or modern life, for that matter. I'm sorry, and win or lose, I hope to earn your respect and trust. That anyone from Mexico \u2014 or any other country \u2014 would risk everything to seek the kind of opportunity and freedom this land has to offer is a tribute to America, and those who pursue it should not be disparaged. From now on, I will discuss and debate policy without ascribing negative labels or cheap stereotypes to those most affected by it.\n\nI must also apologize to the loving parents of a slain Muslim-American soldier. Just because Khizr and Ghazala Khan appeared at the Democratic convention in support of my opponent does not mean they are not deserving of my utmost respect and appreciation for their son's sacrifice to protect the freedoms I enjoy every day. Mr. and Mrs. Khan, I take my hat off to you, and all of our Gold Star families \u2014 regardless of political affiliation \u2014 and respectfully ask for your forgiveness.\n\nIt's past time to apologize for demeaning women as I clearly have by talking about them as objects to be exploited for personal pleasure. This behavior should not be dismissed as \"locker room talk.\" It is vulgar and reprehensible, and has no place in public or private life. I'm ashamed and I'm sorry. I don't expect forgiveness for this one, but I'll ask anyway. I owe Alicia Machado a public apology as well; please forgive me for judging any woman by her physical appearance or weight, rather than by her inner spirit and heart. I'm sorry, Alicia.\n\nThroughout this campaign many of my surrogates, staff members and supporters have tried to explain my hurtful words and often mean-spirited behavior by saying things like, \"He's not a trained politician; he's not politically correct; he just says what's on his mind.\" Or, \"He's a counter puncher; he just hits back when someone hits him first.\" None of us would accept these excuses from our children or co-workers, and you should not accept them from or on behalf of me.\n\nSo, I also want to apologize to all of these folks who have sacrificed personal reputation and credibility in their efforts to make excuses for behavior of mine that was simply inexcusable. While much of my own behavior and speech have had many defenders, I must be honest \u2014 it simply has no defense. I especially apologize to the many evangelical leaders who defended and promoted me against their own moral and biblical convictions and beliefs about character, for I have no doubt cost you much moral authority in future elections.\n\nSecretary Hillary Clinton, I want to apologize for calling you names and inciting hatred toward you and your husband. Our political differences are many, but you have given your life to public service, and that is still a noble calling. If I win, I will want your help. If you win, you can count on my support. America deserves our cooperation.\n\nMy candidacy for this nomination was launched, and succeeded, in response to deep-seated anger from people across this land \u2014 people who believe their government has been taken from them and no longer serves and protects them. I was upset when many of these people supporting me were referred to as deplorables \u2014 yet I recognize now, I am the one who has been deplorable. I'm sorry!\n\nI realize that the best way to make America great again is to appeal to our collective better angels, not to our shrillest tones and most divisive words. For nearly 70 years I've been blessed far beyond anything I could have imagined, and certainly beyond anything I deserve. I want to now give back and serve the country that has provided so much opportunity and blessing for me. I want to serve in a way befitting of the office I seek in the land that is still the greatest on earth.\n\nFinally, I fully expect many people to be skeptical of these apologies and appeals for forgiveness \u2014 after all, I'm trailing nationally in the final weeks of a presidential campaign. I understand such skepticism and have no doubt my sincerity will be questioned across this country. Believe me, I am well aware that my own actions in the days and weeks ahead will have to prove my sincerity, and I intend to work hard to earn the benefit of the doubt. I'll let you be the judge. This much I know \u2014 win or lose, apologizing and asking forgiveness is the right thing to do and I'll be better for it.\n\nThank you, God bless you, and may God bless America.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

As a prominent real estate developer and man about town, his life and loves have been a staple of the New York tabloids for decades. He has starred in a reality TV show and been the subject of several biographies. Since he announced his long-shot campaign for president 19 months ago, he has been a constant presence on television and Twitter.\n\nWe all know Trump. That is to say, we all know of him. We know about the three wives, the five children, the six bankruptcies, the comeback, The Apprentice, the spectacular marketing of the \"Trump\" brand, and the stunning victory in November. But the paradox is how little Americans really understand this celebrity who is becoming the 45th president of the United States, the first person to assume the office with no experience in government or the military.\n\nTrump tapped into the hopes and fears of millions of Americans in achieving an electoral victory with a mandate to shake up Washington and make the Rust Belt shine again. He ran atop the GOP ticket, yet he is a Republican-come-lately. Beneath his thin skin, it remains murky what really matters to him and what he holds sacred. The unknowns about the new president are substantial, both from a personal standpoint and a policy one.\n\nOn the personal side:\n\n\u2014 He ran as a billionaire businessman who could cut great deals for America, but much about his finances remains obscure. That's because of Trump's steadfast refusal to release his tax returns, like every other major party candidate going back nine elections has done. The absence of those returns also robs the American people of understanding the full extent of potential conflicts Trump might have.\n\n\u2014 At 70, Trump is the oldest person to assume the presidency, and he's clearly a high-energy individual for his age. Yet we know only basic information about his physical health and little about his mental health. He shows classic signs of narcissism. But do those traits rise to a clinical personality disorder? We don't know.\n\n\u2014 Modern presidents are subject to a constant barrage of second-guessing, criticism and ridicule. It goes with the job and comes with the territory. Is Trump capable of turning the other cheek? Or will he become consumed with lashing back at his critics? So far \u2014 based on his transition Twitter tiffs with everyone from Meryl Streep to Alec Baldwin to John Lewis \u2014 the evidence isn't encouraging.\n\n\u2014 We don't know whether our new president is a serial sexual aggressor. A dozen women have come forward with accusations, and at least one is suing. Trump has vehemently denied the allegations. But the Access Hollywood tape from 2005 \u2014 on which Trump is heard boasting about grabbing women's genitals \u2014 lends at least some credence to the accusations.\n\nOn the policy side:\n\n\u2014 The relationship between Trump and Russia remains murky. America's intelligence agencies are convinced that President Vladimir Putin directed a hacking and disinformation campaign to help defeat Hillary Clinton. There are open questions about communication between Trump's campaign and the Kremlin. And while a salacious, opposition-research report suggesting Putin is blackmailing the president-elect is wholly unverifiable, nagging suspicions remain about Trump's odd reluctance to criticize the autocratic Russian leader.\n\n\u2014 Trump's foreign policy views leave the nation wondering whether he's crazy like a fox \u2014 or merely crazy. He persistently praises Putin while threatening a trade war with China. He talks one minute of engaging in a nuclear arms race, then another about reaching an agreement with Russia to reduce arsenals. His pick for Defense secretary, James Mattis, accurately describes NATO as \"the most successful military alliance probably in modern history, maybe ever.\" Trump calls it \"obsolete\" and threatens to undermine the European Union. Is Trump being reckless, or is there a larger strategy at work?\n\n\u2014 Trump takes office with ill-defined or irreconcilable domestic policy views. For example, he wants to cut taxes, invest in infrastructure and the military, leave Social Security and Medicare alone \u2014 and simultaneously reduce the federal budget deficit. How can you do that? You can't.\n\nAmerica and the world have a huge stake in a successful Trump presidency. But more than any incoming president in memory, Trump is surrounded by a swirl of anxiety about his intentions. This sense of uncertainty is why the excitement that typically surrounds a presidential inauguration is tempered with trepidation this time around.\n\nIs Trump willing or able to reach beyond his core supporters in an effort to unite a bitterly divided nation? That's another unknown, one that the new president has a prime opportunity to address at Friday's inauguration.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.1073446273803698, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 834, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.45959077427, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170120020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.15827338129496, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/23/laws-used-justify-ariz-sheriffs-raids-upheld/94373740/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Laws used to justify Ariz. sheriff's raids upheld", "wordcount_as_scraped": 872, "date": "20161124050000", "story_content": "PHOENIX \u2014 A federal judge ruled Tuesday that the laws used to back Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's workplace raids will remain on the books, capping off a two-year lawsuit that claimed Arizona's identity-theft statutes targeted immigrant workers.\n\nIn his decision, U.S. District Court Judge David Campbell found that while the laws did largely affect undocumented immigrants, they also served as a legitimate law-enforcement tool in combating identity theft.\n\n\"The laws were passed in part for their effect on immigration by unauthorized aliens,\" he wrote, \"but the legislature was also addressing a pressing criminal problem that adversely affected Arizona residents.\"\n\nArpaio's brand of illegal-immigration enforcement sparked various legal challenges throughout the last several years, and Tuesday's ruling serves as one of the lawman's rare victories.\n\n\"I have taken a lot of criticism for going into the businesses, arresting workers that are here illegally,\" Arpaio said Tuesday evening. \"I said from the beginning my main objective was to enforce the ID laws, so I'm very happy that the judge ruled in our favor.\"\n\nUnlikely that workplace raids will return\n\nIt is unlikely the ruling will resurrect the workplace raids, however. Arpaio recently lost his bid for re-election, and his successor, Paul Penzone, has denounced many of his predecessor's more controversial policies.\n\nThe decision also comes with a caveat. Campbell ruled that state attorneys cannot use I-9 employment forms to investigate or prosecute state identity-theft or forgery violations. Campbell said such use is pre-empted by federal law.\n\nAnnie Lai, a plaintiffs' attorney with the University of California at Irvine School of Law's Immigrant Rights Clinic, said this portion of the ruling \"reaffirms the notion that state and local officials may not appropriate the federal employment-verification system to target undocumented workers.\"\n\nLai noted that the court said additional details will be briefed at a later date.\n\n\"In the meantime, we are considering all available options,\" she said.\n\nTuesday's filing stems from a 2014 lawsuit leveled by civil-rights group Puente Arizona, which challenged two identity-theft laws Arizona legislators passed that made it a felony to use false information to gain employment. The laws applied regardless of whether the fake identity was attached to a real person.\n\nPuente's attorneys contended the laws were less about law enforcement and more designed to purge illegal immigrants in the state. The plaintiffs also argued immigration enforcement was the sole responsibility of federal, rather than state, government.\n\nPlaintiffs cited the bills' sponsors to bolster their arguments. During one of the bills' hearings, then-state Sen. Russell Pearce said Arizona needed to do more to address the problem of illegal immigration, and that \"attrition starts through enforcement,\" according to court documents.\n\nSting operations in Valley\n\nThe lawsuit was primarily inspired by Arpaio's sting operations on local businesses.\n\nLargely acting on tips, deputies would raid restaurants, car washes and other places of employment, arresting mostly low-level employees suspected of using false identities to gain employment. Between 2008 and 2014, the agency conducted more than 80 raids and arrested more than 800 people, almost exclusively immigrant workers.\n\nThe suit also challenged the prosecution of the law, as well as the law's underlying constitutionality, a tactic that roped in the Maricopa County Attorney's Office and the state of Arizona as defendants.\n\nThough Arpaio eliminated the work-site operations in December 2014, Campbell issued a preliminary injunction the following month effectively outlawing prosecution under the laws.\n\nThat injunction was reversed by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in May. The panel acknowledged that while some applications of the laws may conflict with the federal government, the state and federal authorities didn't overlap when the laws were used to prosecute U.S. citizens.\n\nThe parties last met in October, when plaintiffs' and defense attorneys both argued that Campbell should rule in their favor without the case going to trial.\n\nAttorneys representing Arpaio and prosecutors argued that the laws offered legal protection for the victims of identity theft. According to court documents, nearly 50% of the forgery and identity-theft prosecutions under the Maricopa County Attorney's Office \"had at least one identifiable victim.\"\n\nMia Garcia, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Attorney General's Office, said the ruling means state attorneys can resume prosecuting individuals accused of job-related identity theft.\n\n\"The court refused to accept that they could hide behind the equal-protection clause, which protects against race and discrimination,\" she said.\n\nTuesday's ruling has no bearing on another racial-profiling case that has resulted in Arpaio being charged with criminal contempt of court. In that case, another federal judge ruled that Arpaio's deputies had racially profiled Latinos during traffic operations. The judge later found that Arpaio refused to abide by the court's orders that banned the practice.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Puente Director Carlos Garcia said that Arpaio lost his re-election bid because of his \"unjust immigration policies.\"\n\n\"We will continue to fight \u2014 using all tools at our disposal \u2014 to make sure that the rights of our community are protected,\" he said. \"The workplace raids began in 2007 and our years-long battle against local politicians' efforts to tarnish our community has only made us stronger. We will not rest until Arpaio's legacy has been thoroughly rejected.\"\n\nCampbell has asked for both sides' input on the case's remedies to be filed in the coming weeks.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.0, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 845, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.31038935564, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 9, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161124050000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.7337278106508895, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/27/5-things-you-need-know-friday/96943698/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "5 things you need to know Friday", "wordcount_as_scraped": 664, "date": "20170127090000", "story_content": "Pro-life movement gets its turn in D.C.\n\nA week after 500,000 people flooded Washington to support women's issues in the wake of Donald Trump's inauguration, anti-abortion advocates will gather to make their mark at the 44th annual March for Life. Vice President Pence reportedly will speak at the march, becoming the highest-ranking government official ever to do so. Organizers had previously announced that Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway would speak. The march typically occurs on the anniversary of landmark court case Roe v.

The two are expected to discuss topics including NATO cooperation and a bilateral trade deal \u2014 tricky territory, since Trump has questioned the value of the military alliance and has touted a more protectionist trade stance. But both Trump and May have vowed to revive the U.S.-U.K. \"special relationship\" and the closeness of the Reagan-Thatcher years. May hopes some tasty gifts for the Trumps, including apple juice and cookies, will seal the deal.\n\nWorld marks International Holocaust Remembrance Day\n\nFriday is International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the date the United Nations has chosen to commemorate victims of the Holocaust. The anniversary, marked each year since 2005, falls on the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp in 1945. Holocaust survivors from various European countries have received financial compensation for loss of property and enslavement. Others, especially in the former Soviet Union, live below the poverty line. The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, which provides the vast majority of funding, has received aid from several Christian organizations. Still, survivors' advanced age and their financial challenges have made assistance more vital than ever, survivor advocates say.

Earlier this month, an edited video surfaced on the website TMZ showing what appeared to be a frightened dog being forced into water during a shoot. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) called for a boycott and announced they would protest at theaters. The book's author and the movie's producer have defended the film's treatment of its dogs. Despite the debate, A Dog's Purpose was topping Fandango.com's advance ticket sales heading into the weekend.\n\n50 years after fire, NASA honors Apollo 1 crew\n\nA new exhibit will open to the public Friday at the Apollo-Saturn V Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., honoring the Apollo 1 crew killed by a flash fire in 1967. The deadly fire was considered a routine countdown simulation on the pad at Cape Canaveral's Launch Complex 34 and served as an important learning lesson for future missions such as Apollo 11. Along with personal mementos from the Apollo 1 crew, the new exhibit displays the capsule hatch whose cumbersome design essentially trapped the three men in the inferno.\n\nStocks: Asian stocks drifted mostly higher Friday in quiet trading as traders and investors prepared for the start of the lunar new year holiday.\n\nWeather: Lake effect snow will cover the East, including the Appalachians, while cold temperatures are expected in the South.\n\nTV Tonight: Wondering what to watch this weekend?

Here are five strategic tax moves you'll want to make sooner rather than later.\n\n1. Sign up for your employer's 401(k)\n\nIt's estimated that 57% of workers have access to an employer-sponsored 401(k), yet 68% of Americans don't participate in one. If your company offers a 401(k), now's the time to sign up and start building your nest egg. Anyone under 50 can contribute up to $18,000 this year, and if you're 50 or older, you're allowed a $6,000 catch-up for a total of $24,000. While most workers can't afford to max out on these limits, you should aim to set aside 10% of each paycheck if you can swing it. If not, be sure to contribute enough to fully capitalize on whatever matching incentive your company offers. A good 25% of workers pass up a whopping $24 billion each year in unclaimed matching dollars, so at the very least, kick in enough to get your hands on whatever free money your employer is willing to give you.\n\n2. Open or fund your IRA\n\nIf you don't have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, your next best bet is to open an IRA, or, if you've already done so, contribute as much as you can to it. While IRAs have lower contribution limits than 401(k)s \u2013 $5,500 a year for workers under 50 and $6,500 for those 50 and older \u2013 they can still be powerful tools for helping you reach your retirement goals. While you have plenty of time to fund your IRA for the 2017 tax year, what you should really focus on now is boosting your 2016 contribution if you haven't maxed it out already. You have until April 18 (the 2017 tax filing deadline) to make a contribution that counts retroactively toward the 2016 tax year, so don't pass up the opportunity to cut your tax bill this spring.\n\n3. Adjust your withholding\n\nIf you're a salaried worker, your company is required to withhold a portion of your paychecks for tax purposes. But getting that withholding amount right can be tricky. While getting a huge refund might seem like a good thing, in reality, all it means is that you gave the government a tax-free loan and got nothing in return. On the other hand, if you owe the IRS a lot when you submit your return, consider increasing your withholding so you're not faced with a large bill \u2013 or a penalty \u2013 the next time around.\n\n4. Look out for 1099s\n\nIf you're a salaried employee, you probably know to look out for your W-2 around now, but you should also keep your eyes peeled for 1099 forms. Ideally, 1099 forms should be sent out by Jan. 31, though some companies and entities push that limit a bit. Make sure to file those forms away in a safe place and keep track of which you've received and which you haven't. If, for example, you're a freelancer who did work for a number of different companies, you'll want to make sure you have all of your documents in place with enough time to file your upcoming tax return. The sooner you realize you're missing certain forms, the more time you'll have to reach out and follow up so you're not stressed come April.\n\n5. Prepare your tax return early\n\nThough you have until April 18 to file your 2016 taxes, now is actually the perfect time to put your return together. If you're due a refund and submit your return early, you might get your hands on that money sooner.\n\nThat said, if you're among the millions of Americans who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit, you won't receive your refund prior to Feb. 15 this year. Thanks to the recently passed PATH Act, the IRS is ramping up its efforts to prevent tax fraud, and part of that involves delaying refunds under these two credits, which happen to be refundable. In fact, it's estimated that more than 40 million low-income families will have their refunds delayed this year.\n\nAnother thing to think about is that if you prepare your return and find that you owe the IRS some money, you'll have several months to save so you're able to cover that tax bill in full and avoid a late-payment penalty. If you've underpaid on your tax withholding, but wait until the filing deadline to figure that out, you may have a harder time coming up with the cash.\n\nOffer from the Motley Fool: The $15,834 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

The barriers will restrict vehicle access to sensitive areas and assist with crowd control during three days of activities when up to 900,000 people are expected to flood the city. The 1.8 million people who attended the 2009 inauguration of President Obama stands as the record for inaugurations.\n\n\"The global terror environment is very different even from 2013,'' the secretary said, referring to the last inaugural ceremony marking Obama's second term. \"We have to be concerned about individual acts of violent extremism.''\n\nCounter-terrorism officials have been increasingly concerned in recent years of the recruitment campaign waged by the Islamic State terror group, whose operatives have been urging sympathizers to lash out against domestic targets rather than risk travel to the battlefields in Syria and Iraq.\n\nAlthough terrorism and potential attacks from individual extremists remain top concerns of security planners charged with ensuring a peaceful transfer of power, the anticipated surge in demonstrations, both permitted and unsanctioned, also are figuring prominently. The security operation involves 28,000 security officials, including 7,800 drawn from the ranks of the National Guard.\n\nJohnson said 99 protest groups, more than 10 times of the average number at past inaugurations, are expected. At least 63 of those groups are slated to demonstrate on Inauguration Day.\n\nD.C. police have said they are aware of the online boasts of some groups who have vowed to \"shut down'' events.

Temperatures dropped to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit) in the mountains of southern Poland.\n\nIn Italy, eight deaths were blamed on the cold, including a man who died in the basement of an unused building in Milan, and another one on a street flanking Florence's Arno River. Francis asked God to \"warm our hearts so we'll help\" the homeless.\n\nIn Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, several hundred men, mostly from Afghanistan and Pakistan, remained in an abandoned customs warehouse by the city's bus station, where aid organizations distributed heaters, blankets, clothes and food in an attempt to keep them warm.\n\n\"We are all working together to help these people,\" Mirjana Milenkovski, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, said.\n\nWhile most of the several thousand migrants in Serbia have stayed in the Balkan country's asylum centers, hundreds have refused to do so, looking for ways to move on toward western Europe.\n\nIn neighboring Bulgaria, police said two men from Iraq and a Somali woman died from cold in the mountains near Turkey as they tried to make their way toward Europe. Many in the Belgrade warehouse were sick after few days in extreme cold, aid workers said.\n\n\"The next few days are critical, and for sure the health condition of these people is worsening,\" said Stephane Moissaing, MSF Head of Mission in Serbia.\n\nGerman federal police said Sunday they picked up 19 migrants \u2014 including five children \u2014 at a highway stop in Bavaria who were suffering from hypothermia after their driver disappeared and left them on the back of an unheated a truck for hours in the freezing cold.\n\nElsewhere, emergency measures were declared in several municipalities in Serbia's south and southwest. Dozens of villages in Serbia's remote Pestar region were sealed off by heavy snow, prompting the evacuation of some 100 people by emergency crews. Authorities said 70 kilometers of water pipes there were frozen.\n\nNumerous villages in northern Bulgaria also were left without electricity and water. Power outages were also reported throughout the region.\n\nPolar temperatures of between minus 15 and minus 26 degrees Celsius (5 and minus 15 Fahrenheit) saw ice forming on the Adriatic sea and the Danube, while countless smaller rivers, lakes and ponds froze.\n\nMontenegro's port of Bar in southern Adriatic closed down on Saturday, while sea traffic was suspended for days in neighboring Croatia.\n\nPolice in Bulgaria said a passenger train was derailed Sunday after it hit a pile of snow in the central part of the country. Snow fell on Istanbul, Turkey, for the third straight day, and Turkish Airlines grounded hundreds of flights in and out of the city's two airports.\n\nA dozen major roads remained closed in Romania due to heavy snow and some ferry services between Romania and Bulgaria across the Danube were canceled. Authorities said schools would be closed Monday and Tuesday in many areas, including in the capital, Bucharest.\n\nFour Portuguese nationals were killed when a bus skidded on an icy road in eastern France early Sunday. The road is notorious for fatal accidents.\n\nBlack ice across northern and western Germany has caused countless accidents and injuries \u2014 firefighters in the city of Hamburg said Sunday they were called to weather-related accidents 415 times during the weekend.\n\nNear Hannover, one person died in a car accident when his car skidded against a tree on an icy road, German news agency dpa reported.

He was indicted in October in U.S. District Court in Dallas on one count of conspiracy to commit health-care fraud. The federal charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nWhen reached by phone this week, Simmons said, \"I can't make any comments.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors said the scheme involved prescribing \"compounded\" drugs such as pain, scar and migraine creams to military families covered by Tricare, the federal health insurance program for active-duty and retired military and family members.\n\nThere have been at least two other federal probes alleging pharmacies paid kickbacks to doctors who ordered expensive compounded drugs for patients. One involved a California pharmacy that billed the state's worker's compensation program for pricey markups. In another, a Florida doctor was indicted on a charge of taking kickbacks for sending prescriptions, which billed Tricare and Medicare for creams that cost as much as $21,000 for a one-month supply, according to a federal indictment.\n\nGovernment oversight bodies also have questioned the spiraling federal spending on these drugs. Medicare spending on compounded topical drugs has surged 3,400% since 2006, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General reported in June.\n\nAllegations of sham study\n\nThe Texas case that resulted in the indictments of Simmons and 11 others centered on a Dallas-based company called CMGRX LLC, or Compound Marketing Group. Federal prosecutors allege that the marketing group arranged kickbacks to doctors who prescribed and Tricare-insured patients who purchased drugs from four compounding pharmacies.\n\nThe indictment alleged Simmons teamed with two other marketing group representatives to create a sham medical study named the \"Patient Safety Initiative,\" or PSI study.\n\nTricare enrollees were paid study \"grants\" of $250 per month for each prescription they obtained from a partner pharmacy.\n\n\"The defendants and their co-conspirators falsely represented that the study was approved by Tricare and that it was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of compounded drugs,\" the indictment stated. \"In reality, the PSI study was not approved by Tricare, was not overseen by a qualified physician, epidemiologist or other medical professional, had no control group, and was not designed to gather any useful scientific data relating to the safety or efficacy of any drug.\"\n\nWriting prescriptions\n\nThe indictment alleged that Simmons also recruited an El Paso doctor, William F. Elder-Quintana, who wrote thousands of prescriptions that cost Tricare $96 million through June 2016. Elder-Quintana and other doctors were paid $60 for each pain or scar creme prescription or $30 for each vitamin prescription, the indictment said.\n\nThe indictment also alleged that marketing group employees would contact Tricare's pharmacy-benefits consultant, Express Scripts, to find out whether certain drugs were covered. These employees then would adjust the prescriptions to maximize payments from Tricare \"without any regard for the medical necessity for the prescriptions.\"\n\nThe indictment accused marketing group employees of sending prefilled prescription forms to Elder-Quintana, who it alleged would sign the prescriptions after a cursory telephone interview with the patient. Other times, marketing group employees would use a stamp with Elder-Quintana's signature to order prescriptions, the indictment stated.\n\nThe other 11 defendants all listed addresses in Texas.

But the recent death of actress Debbie Reynolds just a day after the death of her daughter, Carrie Fisher, was a dramatic reminder of the links between grief, health and well-being that researchers have been attempting to understand for the past several decades.\n\nReynolds, by all reports, fit a pattern well-known to such researchers: She died of a stroke in the early throes of her loss. Studies show heart attacks and strokes surge in the 30 days after the death of a close loved one. Such reactions are distinct from so-called \"broken heart syndrome,\" another well-documented phenomenon in which spiking stress hormones cause part of the heart to temporarily enlarge, often producing chest pain and shortness of breath.\n\n\"There may be literally a shock to the system,\" in the first days after a death, says S.V. Subramanian, a professor of population health and geography at Harvard University. People who already are in poor health or stressed by months or years of care-giving may be at especially high risk, he says.\n\nBut the fallout from grief doesn't end there. Women who lose spouses die at higher-than-expected rates for three to six months after their losses; for men, the risk remains heightened for a year, Subramanian says.\n\nAnd while grief is not depression \u2014 one is a normal reaction to loss, while the other is an illness \u2014 some mourners also become depressed, suffering from hopelessness and unrelenting sadness. Others experience an especially prolonged, painful, life-disrupting form of grief that goes by various names, including prolonged grief disorder and complicated grief. Exactly how and how soon after a loss health care professionals should identify and help such people is a great source of debate.\n\n\"Grief is a complex, multifaceted reaction that has features that are really unique to each individual and also has some commonalities,\" says M. Katherine Shear, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University.\n\nStudies show many mourners experience initial disbelief, along with waves of sadness and yearning. Anger also is common. But research also shows that many people feel some level of acceptance from the earliest days after a death and that those feelings typically increase over time, says Paul Maciejewski, an associate professor of biostatistics in radiology at Weill Cornell Medical College. When that shift does not occur, some people cannot get on with their lives.\n\n\"As early as six months you can pick out who is going to have long-term problematic symptoms,\" says Holly Prigerson, a professor of sociology in medicine and co-director, with Maciejewski, of a research center on end-of-life care at Weill Cornell.\n\nShear, Maciejewski and Prigerson are engaged in a long-running debate over exactly which symptoms of prolonged or unusual grief should trigger concern and be included in psychiatry's official diagnostic manual.\n\nOther experts worry about what they see as efforts to put time limits on mourning.\n\n\"It's been 22\u00bd years since my daughter died and I still have moments when I feel deep grief,\" says Joanne Cacciatore, an associate professor of social work at Arizona State University who lost an infant in 1994. She works with other families who have lost children or lost loved ones to suicide or homicide. \"In Western culture, we believe in brief grief, but I'm not a fan. There are some things we can accelerate but grief is not one of them.\"\n\nThere is evidence that people who suffer the most prolonged and intense grief continue to suffer mental and physical health consequences. In one study, Prigerson and colleagues found that intense grief lasting more than six months was linked with increases in smoking, blood pressure, cardiovascular illness and suicidal thoughts and behavior. Other studies have found increases in drug and alcohol use and unhealthy changes in weight and diet.\n\nHere are some thing mourners can do to protect their health:\n\n\u25baMake getting enough sleep, nutritious food and exercise a priority, right from the start, even if you don't feel much like taking good care of yourself.\n\n\u25baSeek out social support. One study found widowed men and women who lived in neighborhoods with many other widowed people were less likely to die prematurely, possibly because of better social support (including from potential new mates), Subramanian says. No matter where you live, you may need to \"force yourself to get out and see people and do things,\" Prigerson says.\n\n\u25baRemember that \"grieving is a stressful life event, but most people do adjust,\" Prigerson says. She and Maciejewski say that describes about 90% of mourners. Adjusting does not mean forgetting or never yearning for the lost loved one, they say, but it does mean regaining everyday mental, physical and social functioning.\n\nFor those who do continue to struggle, appropriate professional help remains in short supply, the experts agree. Shear has developed a psychotherapy program that shows promise in studies. Maciejewski and Prigerson are working on an online intervention that could make support more widely available. Cacciatore and colleagues are training professionals to work with families suffering especially traumatic losses.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.1283097267150906, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 843, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.33903278732, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170115190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.2538552787663098, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/11/26/fidels-legacy-repressive-regime-waves-exodus/94467728/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e1": [3504], "\u00fa": [3780, 3991]}}, "headline": "Fidel's legacy: A repressive regime, waves of exodus", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1024, "date": "20161126130000", "story_content": "While the United States has seen wave after wave of immigrants seeking a better life, the occasional bursts of immigrants from Cuba was unique.\n\nIn the early 1960s, more than 14,000 children were sent by their Cuban parents to host families in the United States. In 1980, Fidel Castro allowed people to leave the island in the Mariel boatlift, resulting in more than 100,000 Cubans leaving the island.\n\nThe most stunning exodus occurred in the early 1990s, when tens of thousands of Cubans took to the high seas to avoid the economic conditions that followed the fall of the Soviet Union. Cubans who learned to get by with little during the hardest economic times used their ingenuity to fashion rafts and boats out to make the dangerous trek across the Florida Straits.\n\nLawn-mower engines were refashioned into boat engines. Individuals hopped on inner tubes to paddle more than 100 miles of open ocean. In 2010, a Cuban made the journey on a 7-foot boat made almost entirely of plastic foam.\n\nCuba observers said one of the consistent themes behind each wave was the repressive nature of Cuba's regime.\n\nCarlos Mesa-Lago, a Cuban-born economics professor at the University of Pittsburgh, sums up Cuba's economy under Castro simply: \"He is an excellent politician, but he's a terrible economist.\"\n\nLike most other aspects of Castro's revolution, the economy was a centralized, state-run endeavor where few jobs were ever in the private sector. From factories to hotels to barbershops, the state operated nearly every enterprise and employed nearly every Cuban worker.\n\nWhile that led to impressive employment numbers that hovered near 100% many years, Mesa-Lago said those figures meant little since most jobs were unnecessary and wages have historically remained low. Businesses that required 100 workers were assigned 200 workers, Mesa-Lago said, in order to give the appearance of a functioning economy.\n\n\"The saying was, 'I pretend that I am working, and you pretend that you are paying me,'\" Mesa-Lago said.\n\nIn the early years, Cuba's vast sugar plantations sustained the economy. Cuba was the world's largest sugar exporter for decades and the economy was further bolstered by the extraction of minerals, the tourism industry and the sale of Cuban cigars and rum.\n\nThe Soviets also played a central role, providing subsidies to the island through the height of the Cold War. According to the Institute for Cuba and Cuban-American Studies, Cuba was $20 billion in debt to the Soviet Union when it fell apart.\n\nCuba's economic flaws were exposed following that collapse in 1991. What followed was an era dubbed the \"Special Period\" by the Cuban government, when the economy plummeted, food was scarce and even the state's prized health and education sectors saw major cutbacks.\n\nMesa-Lago said Castro reluctantly instituted a series of reforms to fend off a collapse similar to that of the Soviet Union. The government allowed some people to open private businesses, farmers were able to sell some products on the open market, rules barring foreign investment were loosened and Cubans were allowed to use the U.S. dollar to purchase items.\n\n\"The reason that Fidel went along with this package of reforms was because he probably worried that the regime might be threatened,\" Mesa-Lago said.\n\nOnce the economic situation stabilized, Castro pulled back many of those reforms. In later years, he formed a close bond with Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who saw Castro as the elder statesmen of Latin America. Cuba would send tens of thousands of doctors and teachers to Venezuela in exchange for as many as 90,000 barrels of oil per day in 2008.\n\nIn his later years, Castro sat on the sidelines as he watched his brother Ra\u00fal institute a similar round of reforms. Fallow farmland was opened up for farmers to cultivate, more private business licenses were granted, the country opened up to more foreign investment and in late 2010, Ra\u00fal Castro's government announced that up to 1 million Cubans \u2014 or about 20% of the workforce \u2014 would be removed from the state payroll and allowed to further expand the private business sector.\n\nOne of Castro's first pronouncements upon taking control of Cuba was that all citizens would have free access to education and health care. And even though both sectors suffered because of the country's economic troubles, those institutions endured.\n\nBefore Castro, access to education and proper health care were focused in the capital of Havana and other well-to-do areas. Castro made it a priority to ensure that every Cuban \u2014 poor people in cities, farmers in isolated provinces \u2014 had full access to schools and hospitals.\n\nBy many measures, he succeeded. Cubans' life expectancy is over 77 years old, ranking it higher than more developed Latin American countries like Mexico, Argentina and Chile. And Cuba has the highest literacy rate in Latin America (99.8%), according to the CIA World Factbook.\n\n\"When you go to Cuba, you're constantly meeting all these people with professional training, with scientific training,\" said Dick Cluster, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston who lived in Havana in the early 1990s. \"Those successes are real.\"\n\nAs other sectors of the country suffered, so did health care and education.\n\nCluster said people have unfettered access to doctors and hospitals, but a trip to the hospital usually meant bringing your own linens for the bed, food and clothing. In Castro's later years, the government reduced class sizes in junior high schools and relied more on classes on TV.\n\nGiven the country's stagnant economy, there is also little for successful students to do once they graduate. Many doctors and nurses are sent abroad to China, Venezuela and other countries to provide care in impoverished areas. Cubans battle for the few spots available at foreign companies working in Cuba, and some are allowed to leave the country to work for companies that do business with Cuba.\n\nBut that also leaves many college graduates driving taxis, serving drinks at tourist restaurants and working in other service-sector fields.\n\n\"The educational system keeps cranking out really qualified people, but it also loses them because the economy is not able to offer (acceptable) positions,\" Cluster said. \"There's definitely frustration.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.534759342670441, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1009, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.4052284646, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161126130000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.37859266600595, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/05/support-pours-into-hebrew-union-college-after-swastika-graffiti/96186886/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 744, "scraper_regex": 668}}, "headline": "Support pours into Hebrew Union College after swastika graffiti", "wordcount_as_scraped": 668, "date": "20170105060000", "story_content": "CINCINNATI \u2014 Following statements of support from Cincinnati's mayor and a U.S. senator, a group gathered on the campus of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Wednesday in front of a sign that was painted with a large white swastika earlier this week.\n\nIn freezing temperatures, about 25 people held signs and cheered honking drivers on Clifton Avenue. The group was largely made up of people associated with Call to Action, a progressive Catholic organization.\n\nFaith Kemper of Fort Wright, who organized the event, said she was sick to her stomach when she learned what had happened.\n\nFaculty arrived on campus on Tuesday to find the Nazi symbol painted on a school sign.\n\n\"It's become detached,\" Kemper said of the swastika. \"To those who have relatives who fought for this country's freedom, we know that it's a symbol of evil.\"\n\nKemper said her father fought in World War II and said to her the swastika is symbol of the power hungry and hateful. She was joined by several members of her St. Monica-St. George Parish, whose church is on nearby McMillan Avenue. One carried a sign that said, \"We support our Jewish neighbors.\"\n\nMargaret Quinn of Hyde Park held a sign that read, \"Love Always Wins.\" She said she thinks public racism is becoming more common.\n\n\"They feel emboldened,\" Quinn said. \"I think the [presidential] campaign gave people the idea that it's alright to discriminate.\"\n\nThe incident at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute for Religion comes on the heels of similar incidents throughout the country following November's election, and the alleged vandalism of an interracial couple's home in East Price Hill on Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nThe dean of the school, Rabbi Jonathan Cohen, issued a statement Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"A minor anti-Semitic action occurred on the Cincinnati campus of Hebrew Union College this morning when a swastika was spray-painted on the HUC sign at the entrance to the Clifton Avenue campus,\" Cohen said. \"While only a minor act of vandalism, we are grateful for the immediate support of the Cincinnati police and many friends and neighbors in the Jewish and general communities. For more than 140 years, HUC-JIR has been committed to being the liberal, open and welcoming center of Jewish life and education. We call on supporters and neighbors to increase their commitment to tolerance and respect among members of all faiths.\"\n\nRabbi Kenneth Kanter, associate dean at the college, greeted the group and thanked them for their support. He was joined by Gary Zola, a college professor and director of the American-Jewish Archive. Zola handed out cookies and offered supporters coffee and hot chocolate.\n\nKanter said he's not surprised by the support the school has received because Cincinnati has supported the school since its creation more than 140 years ago, but he said he was grateful for all of the calls, letters and kind words that have poured in.\n\nThe Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion was founded in Cincinnati in 1875 as the first permanent Jewish institution of higher learning in North America. The college has locations in New York, Los Angeles and Jerusalem in addition to the University Heights location.\n\nCincinnati Mayor John Cranley said he was disturbed by the \"act of hate.\"\n\n\"I am deeply offended and disturbed by these actions,\" Cranley said. \"The City is committed to using all of our resources to bring these criminals to justice. As we work to build a more welcoming and inclusive City, we will not stand for this intimidation.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who rescinded his endorsement of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump a month before the election, also spoke out against the vandalism.\n\n\"We must stand in solidarity with our friends at HUC-JIR and make clear there is no place for this in our society,\" Portman said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nWhether acts of public racism are becoming more common or if those acts are just getting more attention due to the political climate, Kemper said it's unacceptable.\n\n\"It's not going to happen on my watch,\" she said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 24, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.3745318353176121, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 744, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.70758790753, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170105060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.3010752688172005, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/04/crimean-essay-soviet-union-collapse-25th-anniversary-russia/95419178/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Crimeans back Russian takeover: If they try to take it back, 'I will fight'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1080, "date": "20170104220000", "story_content": "SEVASTOPOL, Crimea \u2014 Nearly three years after Russia reclaimed Crimea from Ukraine, many in this rugged Black Sea peninsula seem pleased to be back in Russian arms.\n\nThe airport in the capital of Simferopol, about 60 miles north of here, was given a face lift, and a passenger terminal will be added by the end of 2018.\n\nRoads have been improved. Western goods are available in the shops despite sanctions imposed by the West to protest Crimea's annexation by Moscow. There is popular support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans to build a bridge across the Kerch Strait to integrate Crimea with mainland Russia.\n\n\"People feel at home in Russia. That is the main point. It doesn't matter what government was here,\" said Dariya Nemenko, 23. \"If you know your history you know Crimea is Russian and always has been.\n\n\"I didn't want to be a second-class citizen. Under Ukraine, that's what I was,\" she said.\n\nHer husband, Alexander, 51, a historian and engineer who is helping to design the Kerch Strait bridge, said, \"We are one family, the Ukrainian and Russian people. There is no difference.\"\n\nAlexander has written several books about Crimea's convoluted and bloody history. It was seized the first time by the Russian empire in 1783 during the reign of Catherine the Great. It later came under Greek, Roman, Ottoman, British, French and even German Nazi influence. It was given as a \"gift\" to Ukraine by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1954.\n\nThis \"gift\" took on added meaning after Ukraine became independent in 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. After the dissolution, Moscow and Kiev were forced to divide the former Soviet Black Sea naval fleet based here. The separation left a Russian-speaking majority on the peninsula.\n\nIn March 2014, Crimea was occupied by Russian security forces after a series of anti-corruption protests in Ukraine that began in 2004 and culminated in the ouster of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nThe West labeled Russia's move an illegal annexation and imposed economic restrictions. Russia responded by holding a referendum in Crimea in which more than 95% of voters officially backed rejoining Russia. Ukraine's government said the vote was neither free nor fair, and the result was invalid because its territorial sovereignty had been violated.\n\nEven as President Obama announced additional sanctions in December against Russia for alleged interference in the U.S. presidential election, Moscow aggressively pushed ahead with its \"Russification\" of Crimea. There are more than a dozen flights from Moscow to Simferopol each day, and those arriving are not subject to border checks. Russian flags and insignia are visible on buildings and cars. The Russian ruble has replaced the Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia. Ukrainian monuments and advertisements have disappeared.\n\nBooths near the waterfront in Sevastopol sell trinkets, beach towels and calendars that glorify Russia's military and history. Roadside billboards with Putin's image say, \"Crimea is not only for tourism and leisure, it's also for industry and agriculture, and we are investing in this and going to develop it further.\" Ties with Ukrainian companies have been severed, and Russian banks and firms have moved in. Kiosks and stores display European goods for sale.\n\nThough the sanctions do not ban European companies from doing business in Crimea, they forbid dealings with the main ferry company and port that permit the majority of goods to be shipped there. Some European retailers' Russian subsidiaries may help to breach the sanctions, according to Reuters.\n\n\"There are, of course, some things we can't get, although unless you need a very specialized medicine, it's mostly fine. I can find a lot of goods on the Internet,\" Dariya said. \"My grandmother in Germany still manages to send us nice clothes\" for her 5-month-old son, she said.\n\n\"All those years under Ukraine, the government invested nothing in Crimea,\" Alexander complained. \"Kiev completely left us to rot. Now, Russia gives us money. Of course, we thought that by becoming part of Russia again, there would be some problems with the economy, but it is getting better now.\"\n\nSergei Sokolov, 49, a friend of the Nemenkos who works as a civilian engineer for the Russian navy, agreed. \"Ukraine never cared for any of us here. All the enterprises were absolutely abandoned. When we voted in the referendum, there were huge lines. Nobody pressured us with guns, violence or anything else like that. We wanted ... to rejoin Russia despite what the West has said.\"\n\nA NATO study in 2015 found that U.S. and European Union sanctions targeting Russian banks, energy, travel, defense and exports succeeded in \"inflicting damage on the Russian economy.\" Crimea is not mentioned.\n\nA common refrain heard from people here is that any sanctions imposed on Russia have boosted Putin's popularity. Polls bear this out.\n\nThe European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank, noted that accounts of the economic situation in Crimea since the sanctions \"vary wildly.\" Unofficial accounts record huge drops in imports, trade and investment, while official Russian statistics paint an optimistic picture of double-digit growth and an improving tourism sector.\n\nVoices of dissent are hard to find, partly because Moscow made it a crime in 2015 to question Russia's claim on Crimea. In December, a Crimean journalist was charged with \"sabotage and extremism\" and faces up to five years in prison for allegedly breaking the law.\n\nOne man who admitted opposing Russia's occupation asked that he not be named because it could lead to imprisonment or expulsion from Crimea. A Crimean Tatar, he said he has been visited by Russian security services because of his views.\n\nDuring Soviet times, Tatars, an ethnic Turkic group who had lived in Crimea since the 13th century, were forcibly expelled by Josef Stalin. They mainly settled in exile in Turkey and Uzbekistan. When the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, thousands returned. They make up about 25% of Crimea's population of more than 2 million.\n\nThe critic said people were earning less money, the takeover has been been bad for business and tourism, and Crimea has become a police state. He said a lot of Crimeans who were pro-Ukrainian changed their views because they were scared.\n\nThe Nemenkos said they are aware of such views and have sympathy for those who do not think Russia serves their interests. But this sympathy has a red line. \"I don't want war with our Ukrainian brothers, but if they try to take back Crimea, I will fight,\" Alexander said.\n\n\"As will I,\" Dariya said. \"It is my native land.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.2206118106842, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1046, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.42004539562, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.81644359464627, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/01/12/sec-cracking-down-fuzzy-math-company-earnings/96451422/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1019, "scraper_regex": 853}}, "headline": "SEC cracking down on fuzzy math in company earnings", "wordcount_as_scraped": 853, "date": "20170112220000", "story_content": "Prompted by federal regulators, Tesla urged its numbers crunchers to do their work a bit differently last year.\n\nAlarmed by publicly traded companies' increasing ways to be creative with their income statements, the Securities and Exchange Commission updated last May its standards on how earnings and revenue should be reported in quarterly financial statements. The electric automaker, founded by Elon Musk, became one of the most prominent examples of companies working to meet the new standards after being sent a letter from the regulatory agency.\n\nThe SEC's changes aim to crack down on companies' use of the so-called non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) in financial results that often look more favorable than the numbers resulting from GAAP, which is the standard guideline for financial accounting in the U.S. The practice is widespread, and the SEC allows some non-GAAP metrics.\n\n\"Substantial progress has been made in addressing the problematic practices,\" Wesley Bricker, the SEC's chief accountant said in a speech at an industry conference in December. \"However, there is more progress for companies to make.\"\n\nCompanies typically use non-GAAP earnings \u2014 also called pro forma earnings \u2014 to remove the negative impact from one-time special events or revenue that are difficult to record within a specific period, say revenue that can't be booked until transactions are fully closed. And, while GAAP rules consider stock options awarded to executives a cost, many companies continue to exclude them in non-GAAP presentations to enhance the bottom line\n\nCompanies argue that non-GAAP figures allow them to tell a fuller, more nuanced story about their operating performance, but some industry watchdogs say their use hurts investors, particularly the more unsophisticated segment, and undermines transparency that is accepted as a bedrock principle of capital markets. Most companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index \u2014 449 out of 500 \u2014 presented at least one non-GAAP metric between July and September of 2015, according to a study by research firm Audit Analytics.\n\n\"I don't' think you (as an investor), should work that hard,\" says Paul Zarowin, an accounting professor at New York University. Earnings \"should be straightforward. If (a company) had a negative figure and transformed that into positive, you should know that easily.\"\n\nThe SEC's updates in May technically aren't rules but are staff interpretation of the existing rules, but companies and their lawyers accept the changes as new standards, says Ryan Castillo, a securities attorney at Morrison & Foerster.\n\nCompanies found to be lacking in compliance are sent a letter by the SEC. If companies object, discussions with SEC regulators typically ensue. The SEC can penalize by withholding clearance for the SEC paperwork needed for companies' capital financing, issue fines or bring civil enforcement actions for violations of federal securities laws, he says.\n\nSince May, there has been an \"uptick\" in the comment letters issued by the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance \u2014 more than 200 \u2014 to companies seeking compliance, principally about non-GAAP reporting, he says\n\nTesla, whose earning statements were notorious for the use of non-GAAP figures, said in October that it would stop issuing non-GAAP revenue and financial metrics related to a now discontinued program that allowed customers to sell a vehicle back to the company at a predetermined price after a few years. In GAAP accounting, it deferred the revenue as operating leases, but in non-GAAP accounting Tesla added the vehicle sales price to overall revenue, making it appear larger.\n\nOther companies receiving \"please-comply\" letters regarding their non-GAAP figures include Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Brookdale Senior Living, Salem Media, Radio One and Lending Club. In 2016, the SEC also charged two former accounting executives of American Realty Capital Properties, now known as Vereit, for overstating the financial performance using a non-GAAP metric.\n\nAmong the SEC's recent updates on non-GAAP rules:\n\nWith the changes in place only for a few months, the level of corporate compliance is difficult to gauge. But Audit Analytics found that companies are making strides, at least in headlines. In a report in December, the firm said only 28 of S&P 500 companies \u2014 or 6% \u2014 displayed a non-GAAP metric before a GAAP equivalent in their press release headlines from July to September. That's down from 40% of the filings dated April to June.\n\nStill, Zarowin of NYU says non-GAAP will continue to be entrenched in companies' filings. \"If they want to dress up their earnings \u2014 unless the SEC starts fining people in a big way, which I don't really see \u2014 the firms will find a way to push the limits,\" he says.\n\nAnd there's the Trump factor. President-elect Donald Trump nominated Jay Clayton as the new SEC chair last week, and the agency could roll back a large chunk of its regulations if Trump has his way. Trump, the real estate developer, is familiar with non-GAAP rules.\n\nIn 2002, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, then majority-owned by Trump, became the first target of the SEC's crackdown on pro forma earnings rules when it received a cease-and-desist order for making \"misleading statements\" in a earnings release in 1999.\n\nIf Trump were to roll back on non-GAAP rules, it \"wouldn't surprise me at all,\" Zarowin says. \"Trump is not a fan of SEC regulation.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.2755101919174199, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1019, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.65644246894, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170112220000, "FairnessVice": 3, "pct_mft_words": 1.8645731108930301, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/29/trump-order-leaves-iraqi-allies-limbo/97214000/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 719, "scraper_regex": 683}}, "headline": "They worked for America and now they can't get into the USA", "wordcount_as_scraped": 683, "date": "20170129200000", "story_content": "As Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily worked for years to establish ties with America.

Some of that went toward the cost of the plane tickets and the application process. The ticket was for Jan 30.\n\nOn Saturday, the International Organization for Migration told him he was not going.\n\n\"I lost everything,\" he said, starting to cry, \"my life, my house, my car, my job.

But now he's barred from moving with her to the United States, where he had hoped to get a master's degree in linguistics and buy a house in Texas.\n\n\"My wife ... wanted to go back home for a long time, but we can't,\" Resol said. \"She's stuck here because of me.\"\n\nIraqis admitted to the Untied States are not a threat, according to those familiar with the program.

More than 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq now support Iraqi forces to drive the militants out of the country and are now engaged in a major offensive to drive militants from Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.\n\nThe U.S. military is also supporting tribal and other local groups fighting the Islamic State in northern Syria.\n\n\"These Iraqis and Syrians are our battle buddies,\" Jeffrey said. \"How is that (Trump's administration order) going to be perceived by the people out there fighting next to us in Mosul and northern Syria?\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.26460075378418, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 719, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.20153454847, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170129200000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.17246175243394, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/16/warrant-employees-falsified-indiana-voter-forms-meet-quota/93991886/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Warrant: Employees falsified Indiana voter forms to meet quota", "wordcount_as_scraped": 770, "date": "20161117010000", "story_content": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Employees of a voter registration agency told police they turned in some falsified registration forms due to pressure from supervisors to meet a quota for registering Indiana voters, according to a search warrant unsealed Monday.\n\nCanvassers working on behalf of the Indiana Voter Registration Project may have submitted hundreds of fabricated, incorrect or incomplete voter registration forms in counties across the state, the warrant alleges. Police say they found registrations for people who were already registered and said they did not authorize anyone from the group to re-register them, as well as registrations with incorrect birth dates, names and signatures that did not match previous registrations.\n\nThe search warrant offers details into the voter fraud investigation that sparked controversy and concern in the weeks leading up Election Day. The investigation conducted by the Indiana State Police spurred Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson to publicly say in October that incorrect voter registration forms that were submitted may constitute voter fraud. That revelation built on fears of a rigged election stoked by President-elect Donald Trump in the final weeks of his campaign.\n\nIndiana Democrats, though, accused Lawson of speaking out prematurely, inflaming partisan fears. The Indiana Voter Registration Project is an offshoot of Patriot Majority USA, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that in part seeks to register voters in historically under-represented areas. Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry later made a statement urging police to stop discussing the investigation publicly, called accusations of voter fraud \"premature\" and asked third parties to stop making \"reckless assertions\" of voter suppression and intimidation.\n\nThough no charges have been filed against any workers or officials at Patriot USA, the search warrant authorized Indiana State Police detectives to search the Indiana office on North Meridian Street and seize computers and documents. The warrant outlines the detectives' case against the voter group and asks a judge to find probable cause for a search.\n\nPatriot Majority USA, spokesman Bill Buck said in a statement that the group paid employees by a day's work, not by form. He said in the statement that employees who turned in faulty registration forms were not asked back.\n\n\"The professionalism of the Indiana Voter Registration Project is further proven by the fact that most of the canvassers mentioned in these warrants were fired, let go, not called back or quit before the State Police became involved in this matter,\" the statement read. \"In addition, most of the non-verified applications mentioned in the warrants were flagged as incomplete or inaccurate by the Project itself, as part of its quality-control process, in order to ensure that no ineligible individual or application made its way onto the Voter File.\"\n\nIn September, officials of the Marion County Board of Voter Registration told police the group submitted more than 27,000 voter applications, the warrant says. The board was \"suspicious\" of the group, so they sent an attorney to the group's headquarters to take photographs.\n\nThe Marion County Voter Registration Office also flagged 570 suspect voter registration applications and handed them over to police, the warrant says.\n\nPolice began reviewing registrations submitted by the Indiana Voter Registration Project and found incomplete applications, as well as applications for people who were already registered to vote, the warrant says.\n\nDetectives interviewed employees, who, according to the warrant, said they were pressured to register at least 10 voters during a shift to be able to keep working. The employees told police they were generally paid $75 for about five hours of canvassing in often low-income neighborhoods. One employee told police she completed voter registration forms \u2014 without the potential voter's permission \u2014 to meet the quota, the warrant says.\n\nAnother employee told police she took credit for registering 10 to 15 voters she did not actually speak to, the warrant says.\n\nIndiana State Police detectives raided the headquarters on Oct. 4, and seized documents, hard drives and laptops.\n\nExperts have said that voter registration fraud doesn't necessarily translate into fraud at the polls.\n\n\"There's no question some amount of voter registration fraud happens,\" Michael Pitts, a law professor and dean's fellow at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, told IndyStar in October. \"It generally seems to be related to people being paid to collect registration forms. If you get paid to generate registration forms, you're incentivized to make them up. That is certainly fraud.\n\n\"But there isn't much evidence that voter registration fraud translates into actual people coming to the polls under a false identity. And that's a distinction that needs to be drawn. Fake registration forms happen, but whether that actually translates into a fraudulent vote is a totally separate question.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.00582075119019, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 777, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.1570380377, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161117010000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.34620334620335, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/11/trump-cabinet-confirmation-schumer-senate-column/96367596/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Schumer should follow precedent on Trump nominations: Senators Dole & Lott", "wordcount_as_scraped": 895, "date": "20170111190000", "story_content": "The new minority leader in the Senate, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has vowed that he and his fellow Democrats will aggressively target President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees as part of an effort to stretch the confirmation hearings of these accomplished Americans for months. Some advice from two people who've been there: It's a bad idea.\n\nThe American people said with a bold voice on Election Day that they want Washington to get into gear. Stalling the confirmation of presidential nominees en masse will be viewed, rightly, as just an extension of the petty politics that Americans are so strongly rejecting.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the Senate's job is to \"advise and consent\" to the president's Cabinet choices, and to object only in select instances in which an individual might be uniquely unqualified to serve. This is an obligation we and our Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle understood and consistently respected during our time in office, even when considering nominees from a new president from the other party.\n\nRecognizing that a swift transition of power is in the best interests of our nation, senators of the opposing party have traditionally allowed new presidents to assemble their Cabinets as quickly as possible. They've raised questions and even blocked an individual nomination on occasion, when deemed necessary. But never in modern history has either party engaged in wholesale obstruction of a president's slate of nominees simply for the sake of holding things up.\n\nIn 1993, we were both involved in the confirmation of President Clinton's Cabinet nominees. There were problems with some of the people Clinton was considering, but of those nominees actually submitted, all were confirmed by the Senate by the day after the inauguration. In our view, if the president's nominees were qualified in terms of education, experience and character, it was our duty to the country to allow him to begin his term with his Cabinet in place.\n\nAs much as we might have disagreed on matters of policy or philosophy with some of Clinton's nominees, we and our colleagues never entertained the notion of willfully denying the new president the opportunity to begin his presidency with as much of his Cabinet in place as possible. Our predecessors in the Senate felt the same way, as have our successors \u2014 at least to this point.\n\nIn 2001, the Senate approved seven of President Bush's Cabinet nominees within hours of his inauguration, including his secretaries of State, Defense and Treasury. Heeding the Constitution and putting the country first, Democrats in the Senate allowed the new president to assemble his Cabinet as quickly as possible, even with the sting of the Florida recount and the Bush v. Gore court ruling still fresh in their minds.\n\nIn 2009, seven of President Obama's nominees were confirmed the day he was sworn into office. One day after inauguration, Hillary Clinton was confirmed as secretary of State. Three other Cabinet nominees were confirmed by the end of the first week. Heeding the Constitution and putting the country first, Republicans in the Senate allowed the new president to assemble his Cabinet as quickly as possible.\n\nThe actions of both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate in 2009 generally comported with a declaration then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made at the time: \"It is up to us, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, to work as quickly as we can to confirm the worthy nominees so they, along with our president, can hit the ground running.\"\n\nAnd Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., insisted at the time that having nominees in place \"before the inauguration\" was something that should be done \"for the good of the American people.\"\n\nSen. Leahy's words echoed the 2009 recommendations of the bipartisan Continuity of Government Commission, established after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and chaired by former presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford and former senators Alan Simpson and David Pryor.\n\n\"The most dangerous time for presidential succession is the inauguration of a new president, when the outgoing line of succession is gathered together and the incoming line is not yet in place,\" the commission warned. It urged enhanced cooperation between the incoming and outgoing administrations and their allies so the Senate could confirm Cabinet appointments before the new president takes office on Jan. 20.\n\nTaken altogether, you may see why we find Sen. Schumer's statements so worrisome. The Democrats' apparent plan to impede the confirmation process and obstruct the new president's nominees en masse would trample constitutional precedent, tarnish America's reputation, and potentially jeopardize the nation's security.\n\nToday, it is more crucial than ever for the next president to hit the ground running. The American people have spoken, and they expect their elected representatives in Washington to get busy on pressing matters such as job creation, securing our communities, and restoring honesty to our government.\n\nWe urge our friend, Minority Leader Schumer, to put the interests of the nation first, heed the Senate's well-established traditions and obligations, and speedily confirm Trump's Cabinet. The country deserves nothing less \u2014 and at a time of such consequence for our country and its future, we suspect our fellow citizens will stand for nothing less.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

This can be fun \u2014 as with \"The Chalkening,\" the chalking of Trump slogans on college campuses that left many campus leftist feeling triggered \u2014 but two recent episodes illustrate that there are good and bad ways of expressing disagreement.\n\nOn the good side, we have a protest by veterans at Hampshire College, a small liberal arts school in Massachusetts that responded to the burning of an American flag by taking down flags all over campus.\n\nVeterans were unhappy, and over a thousand people marched to protest the decision. As one veteran interviewed by WWLP TV said, \"They took down my flag, they have a right to that, I'm here to defend their right to do that but I want them to understand how bad that hurts me.\"\n\nThe protesters were peaceful and well-mannered \u2014 though one counterprotester, who may or may not have been a student, sat down in the middle of a group of pro-flag protesters who were having their picture taken and made an obscene gesture.\n\nAlthough Hampshire College's president skipped the event, the point was made. Hampshire made a decision the veterans disagreed with, the veterans made their disagreement known, and everyone parted amicably. And, unlike President-elect Trump, they weren't calling for anyone to be jailed.\n\nOn the not-so-good side, we have a list of \"anti-American\" college professors on a site called \"Professor Watchlist.\" The making of lists is itself an exercise of free speech, of course, but unlike the veterans' protest above, this seems punitive. As an editorial at The American Interest notes, \"If Orwellian left-wing speech codes are wrong, then McCarthyist speech codes are wrong as well. If the principle of academic freedom requires the protection of conservative scholarship, it requires the protection of liberal scholarship, too. The aim of genuine defenders of the liberal tradition must be to promote tolerance and open-mindedness, not to replace left-wing academic hegemony with a right-wing version.\"\n\nDefenders of the watchlist might respond that their list, unlike campus speech codes, isn't punishing anybody. (And hey, TheWashington Post itself just published a list of \"fake news\" sites \u2014 including things like the Drudge Report \u2014 that some have called \"McCarthyite.\") But it still seems pretty punitive to me.\n\nSome folks on the right may feel that turnabout is fair play. The left, lately, has gotten into the habit of treating words it disagrees with as if they're somehow wrongful acts to be punished. The meaningless term \"hate speech\" \u2014 which just means speech that lefties don't like \u2014 has been used to attack the free speech of, well, people that lefties don't like.\n\nBut as satisfying as some might find it to turn those tactics around, the truth is that we all benefit from people's ability to speak freely. One reason why the Democrats were blindsided by Trump's victory \u2014 and why the British establishment was gobsmacked by the Brexit vote \u2014 is that people didn't feel they could speak freely on those subjects. A society in which people are forced to hide their views is a society in which a lot of things remain hidden.\n\nAnd the very notion of having to watch what you say lest you lose your job, get expelled from school, or face social ostracism is offensive, more evocative of communist hellholes like North Korea or Cuba than of a free society. It's time to stop treating speech we disagree with as some sort of crime and start treating it as speech we disagree with, to be met by more speech, not punishment.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

Some felt victims had a right to be present at every phase of the process. Others talked of the damage the delays in the trial have done.\n\nAfter 45 minutes of hearing victims and news media objections, however, Gergel said his order closing the hearing would remain.\n\n\"This is an unusual case and we want to get it right,\" the judge said.\n\nProsecutors are seeking the death penalty for Dylann Roof, 22, who faces 33 federal charges in connection with the murders of nine African-Americans at the church in Charleston in June 2015.\n\nRoof's trial began Nov. 7 with jury selection but was called to a halt. Gergel subsequently disclosed that Roof was undergoing a competency evaluation and that a hearing to determine his competency to stand trial would be held Wednesday. Gergel this week moved the hearing to Nov. 21 and issued an order Wednesday closing the hearing, saying opening it could threaten Roof's right to a fair trial.\n\nThe Greenville News and USA TODAY Network objected to the closure, along with the Associated Press, the Charleston Post and Courier and The State newspapers, National Public Radio, WCSC-TV and federal prosecutors.\n\nBut the victims brought a reminder of the human toll of the murders and gave voice to community concerns that the process for trying Roof be transparent.\n\nGergel invited anyone wishing to object to his order to come to the front of the courtroom and speak their mind.\n\nThe Rev. Eric S.C. Manning, pastor of Emanuel, told Gergel that the trial's delays have caused anxieties among church victims who he said lie awake at night and wonder what is going on.\n\n\"The delays create the impression that perhaps there is something else afoot,\" he said.\n\nGergel, who offered his sympathies to each victim or family member who spoke to him, told Manning there was nothing else afoot.\n\n\"We are just trying to do it right,\" he said, using a phrase he repeated throughout the afternoon. \"We don't want to do it over again. We want to do this one time.\"\n\nCompetency hearings, Gergel wrote in his order, offer factors that complicate the fair trial process if left open. For instance, he said, the defendant can talk to the court-appointed examiner without any Miranda warning and may disclose matters that would not be allowed to be disclosed in a trial because of a Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and not testify against himself.\n\nAlso, he wrote, a defendant in a competency hearing can testify without waiving his right to remain silent at trial. And in some instances, Gergel wrote, a competency report may not be used against a defendant at trial, and doing so could lead to a verdict in a death-penalty case being overturned.\n\nGergel told the courtroom Thursday that he had received the examiner's report on Roof's competency at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday and had read it, convincing him the hearing scheduled for Monday should not be open.\n\nAlana Jackson, granddaughter of Daniel Simmons Sr., one of the victims of the church shooting, told Gergel that it looked like there had been \"stall tactic after stall tactic\" used in the trial. She asked him to consider the \"signal this sends to the community\" if the competency hearing is closed.\n\nTyrone Sanders, whose wife and granddaughter survived the shooting while his son died, said closing the hearing to victims makes him feel \"slighted.\"\n\n\"It seems like it would be unfair for us not to be there,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed to a Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals case in 2012 in California, one of the rare cases in which he said there was an attempt to close a competency hearing. The judge in that case refused to close the proceedings.\n\nThe judge, the appeals ruling stated, noted that nothing in federal law provides that competency hearings should be closed to the public, and the panel agreed.\n\n\"Competency proceedings of a criminal defendant have historically been open to the public and press,\" the ruling noted.\n\nMuller told Gergel, who said he was familiar with the opinion, that the ruling found that if closure is to be because of damaging publicity, \"the publicity must create a pattern of deep and bitter prejudice throughout the community.\" He said he did not think with all of the publicity thus far in the case, publicity from the competency hearing would produce a pattern of \"deep and bitter prejudice.\"\n\nGergel said while Muller had not seen the examiner's report, he had and \"it's not a normal examiner's report.\"\n\nThe judge said social media offers a challenge beyond that of traditional publicity. Just because he tells jurors in the case not to look at newspapers or television, Gergel said, news of the case could still pop up on their iPhone or tablet. He said the trial is poised at the beginning of jury selection.\n\n\"I cannot imagine a more vulnerable moment,\" he said.\n\nMuller argued that information from the competency hearing could actually help a defendant because it aids in understanding any reasons behind the crime.\n\nBut Gergel said he was not convinced and pointed to the unique nature of the case.\n\nHe said he plans to work on his order after the competency hearing through Thanksgiving and plans to release a redacted transcript of the hearing at some point.

Whatever his motive, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Donald Trump's triumph over Hillary Clinton paves the way to repair deeply strained relations between Moscow and Washington.\n\n\"We are aware it is a difficult path, in view of the unfortunate degradation of relations between the Russian Federation and the United States,\" Putin said during a ceremony for ambassadors in the Russian capital after sending Trump a message of congratulation on his surprise victory. Putin said he hopes the two nations can \"work together\" to end their \"crisis state.\"\n\nU.S.-Russian ties have worsened since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from neighboring Ukraine and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Those moves led to international sanctions that prompted Putin to retaliate against foreign companies operating in his country.\n\nRussia's intensified military support for Syrian President Bashar Assad in his long-running civil war also has strained relations with Washington, which wants Assad to step aside and complains that Russian airstrikes have targeted U.S.-backed rebels in Syria.\n\nIf that weren't enough friction, Putin's government is now under attack from U.S. intelligence officials who claim Moscow is behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails as part of an effort to disrupt the U.S. presidential election.\n\nPutin has repeatedly denied helping the separatists in Ukraine, intentionally targeting U.S.-backed rebels in Syria or hacking Democrats' emails. Washington has consistently accused Moscow of straying from the truth.\n\nMichael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia who teaches at Stanford University, noted how much relations have deteriorated in the past two years. \"Even when times had taken a very negative turn, we were still able to have radical disagreements and continue to cooperate,\" he said. \"During the (2014) Sochi Olympics, we had a very good relationship with Russian intelligence agencies to try to prevent terrorist attacks.\"\n\nHow Putin proposes to improve relations is not clear. During the campaign, Trump praised Putin's strong leadership and criticized NATO allies for not paying their fair share for a military alliance that has deployed troops and equipment on Russia's doorstep in the Baltic states, much to Putin's displeasure. Still, the president-elect may not meet Putin's expectations, some analysts say.\n\n\"In Russia, it is acceptable that the president can just do whatever he wants, that he has more power than a czar. The Trump we have seen so far, however, is the campaign Trump and will differ from Trump the president,\" said Alexei Makarkin, deputy head of the Moscow-based Center for Political Technologies, a think tank. \"The Kremlin hopes that Trump will become a kind of (President Richard) Nixon who will be willing to make concessions. There may be a thaw, but not one based on common values.\"\n\nSteve Pifer, a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under President George W. Bush, said while Trump's Russia policy is not yet known, there has nonetheless been a lot of consistency in the way he talks about Russia. What Trump has described \"would be a reset that ignores Russia's actions in Ukraine, ignores the challenges Russia poses to the West,\" said Pifer, now a scholar at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.\n\nA \"reset\" of U.S.-Russian relations to improve ties was one of President Obama's earliest foreign policy initiatives. It failed following Russia's intervention in Ukraine.\n\nIan Brzezinski, a former Defense Department official who is now a NATO analyst at the Atlantic Council think tank, said Trump's appointments and first actions as president will be key indicators of his Russia policy and overall foreign policy, which candidate Trump left sketchy.\n\n\"It's not like we're dealing with a deeply thought out foreign policy from the campaign,\" Brzezinski said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.13618159294128, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 668, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.64418901314, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161109170000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.4431137724550895, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/11/05/election-2016-cyber-hack-issues-homeland-security-indiana-pennsylvania-election-protection-verified-voter/93262960/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Cyber 'SWAT' teams gird for Election Day trouble", "wordcount_as_scraped": 960, "date": "20161105190000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Law enforcement officials, government workers and cyber-security professionals are preparing to swoop in, track and hopefully block anyone attempting a cyberattack aimed at destabilizing the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe possibility is slight, with risks lessened by the fractured, mostly non-digital nature of the national voting apparatus. Still, fears that hackers \u2014 perhaps from Russia \u2014 could instill doubts about the voting process via attacks on the Internet infrastructure have put the cyber-security community on guard.\n\nIn a way, they are girding for war, but the fronts are multiple and decentralized. Although many are keeping low profiles, we know about some.\n\n\u2022 The Department of Homeland Security has been conducting cyber audits of state and local election systems since August, responding to requests from 46 states and 32 local election officials.\n\n\u2022 Indiana is setting up an election cyber-war room.\n\n\u2022 In Washington, D.C., and on the ground in 26 states, the non-partisan Election Protection coalition will staff hotlines for voters and have an election geek squad ready for questions from jurisdictions.\n\n\u2022 The Election Verification Network has assembled an elite \"A-Team\" of cryptographers, analysts and security experts who will make themselves available to any jurisdictions needing help on Election Day and in the vote counts that follow.\n\nNot surprisingly, many details of these \"SWAT\" teams' plans are kept under wraps.\n\n\"Best practices for cyber security means we don't tell people what they are,\" said the Pennsylvania secretary of State's press secretary, Wanda Murren.\n\nFederal authorities say the decentralized and antiquated nature of the country's vote tabulation systems would be difficult to penetrate. The worry, instead, is focused on other disruptions.\n\nTwo federal officials told USA TODAY there is concern systems unrelated to the country's vote-tabulation system could be targeted to raise anxiety as voters go to the polls Tuesday.\n\nThe officials, who are not authorized to comment publicly, said breaches could take the form of what are known as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, similar to last month's rolling operation that knocked a number of popular websites offline for hours.\n\nThere was no specific or credible information, however, that such operations are being planned to disrupt the election.\n\n\"We have these concerns around every election, but I have to say that I think there is more of a concern this time than I've seen in the past,\" California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN.\n\nOf the cyber threat posed by Russia, Schiff said that the Russian government had \"prepared the field if they wanted to escalate.\"\n\nIt's those concerns that have created an unprecedented level of preparation, both by government and civil society groups.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is working with state and local election officials to protect against cyber vulnerabilities, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said in a recent interview.\n\nThe cyber scans found some vulnerabilities, \"an open door here or there, which are being addressed after doing these assessments,\" he said.\n\nSome states have received a more in-depth, on-site assessment from Homeland Security.\n\n\"There are fewer states that have gone to that extent. And I would expect and hope and expect that after the election more would do the same thing,\" Johnson said.\n\nPennsylvania is one of the states that took advantage of the federal security check, which found its safety security measures were working well.\n\nIn Indiana, a public-private partnership of cyber-security experts from local universities, the state's cyber-security firms and state government and law enforcement has come together to support the state should anything occur.\n\nA \"war room\" will be set up at the security operations center of Rook Security in Indianapolis, where the group's 30 or so members will spend Election Day, said Rook CEO J.J. Thompson.\n\n\"We'll be available in real time, so the fastest possible remediation can take place,\" he said.\n\nDoug Rapp, an adviser for cybersecurity and national security initiatives for the Indiana Secretary of Commerce, will be among those in the war room on Tuesday. The level of collaboration between the public and private sector on this issue is something that stands out about Indiana, he said.\n\n\"It's a collective risk that requires a collective response,\" he said.\n\nIf all else fails, a rapid-response team composed of some of the best-known names in cyber security, cryptography and computer network security will stand at the ready beginning on Tuesday to assist authorities if cyber issues arise during or after the election. The group is spread out across the country and represents multiple disciplines and some of the top names in the admittedly obscure field of election cyber verification and security.\n\nAmong others, the group includes Andrew Appel, a Princeton University computer scientist known for his work on how voting machines can be hacked; Josh Benoloh, a senior cryptographer at Microsoft Research; Harri Hursti, a Finnish computer scientist for whom the \"Hursti Hack\" of voting machines was named; Walter Mebane, a University of Michigan expert on detecting electoral fraud; and Ron Rivest, an MIT professor and the R in RSA, a ground-breaking cryptographic algorithm.\n\nReaching out to voters, Election Protection, a non-partisan coalition with more than 100 local, state and national partners, will staff a multilingual hotline, 866-OUR-VOTE, beginning Monday night to track issues and aid voters.\n\n\"We feel we're likely to hear very quickly if a cyber problem occurs because we'll be getting calls from around the country,\" said Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Lawyers' Committee's Voting Rights Project, a member of the coalition.\n\nThe group will alert officials if calls begin to come from any one area that could potentially indicate a problem.

But that doesn't mean we have to lose our civility.\"\n\nVan Zandt knows his way around the Richard Rodgers theater as that's where he and wife Maureen Van Zandt produced the hit \"The Rascals: Once Upon a Dream.\" The Van Zandts are joining with music man Paul Shaffer and Joe Grano of \"Jersey Boys\" fame to produce the upcoming \"Piece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story.\"\n\nAs for political activism, Van Zandt is best known for leading the 1985 \"Sun City\" album, which featured Bono, Miles Davis, Bruce Springsteen, Run-DMC and more. The project called on artists to boycott Sun City in South Africa, which at the time was an apartheid state.\n\nIt was the most respectful, benign form of bullying ever. But bullying nonetheless.

The department said it granted waivers to 392 legal permanent residents, known as green card holders, after they underwent additional screening and allowed to enter the country.\n\n\"They're all in, but they were temporarily detained to make sure that the safety of the other 325 million Americans was put first,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday. \"I don't see how that's a big problem.\"\n\nThat assertion was challenged by a team of lawyers from civil rights and immigration advocacy groups, who said an undetermined number of legal immigrants were still being detained Monday at airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, Las Vegas and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\nElizabeth Foydel, policy counsel for the New York-based International Refugee Assistance Project, said lawyers continue scrambling around the country to ensure that Homeland Security is abiding by a ruling issued by a New York federal judge prohibiting the government from deporting anybody under Trump's order.\n\n\"We have attorneys on the ground who are waiting with families of people who have not been let out yet,\" Foydel said. \"Some airports have been complying entirely with the stays that are issued, some we're trying to ensure compliance at this point.\"\n\nTrump sparked a worldwide scramble on Friday when he signed his executive order that suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and barred all legal immigration for 90 days from seven predominantly Muslim countries with ties to terrorism: Libya, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The temporary suspensions are designed to give a collection of federal agencies time to develop \"extreme vetting\" procedures for people coming from those countries. Entry by Syrians was put on indefinite hold because of concerns about Islamic State militants still operating in that country.\n\nHomeland Security said it immediately issued new guidance to its port officers working at airports, and updated its computerized tracking system to identify citizens of those seven countries who attempted to enter the U.S. But Homeland Security provided no official public guidance on the plan until Sunday night, leading to mass confusion for travelers and their attorneys.\n\nThe ban and personal hardships it created prompted protests around the country and left attorneys scrambling to find and make contact with people who were being detained. It also led to at least three emergency federal court rulings that barred Homeland Security from deporting anybody under Trump's order.\n\nWhite House officials likened the detentions endured by passengers over the weekend as inconvenient travel delays that Americans face every day. Spicer said only 109 people were detained out of 325,000 who traveled during one 24-hour period over the weekend.\n\n\"This has been blown way out of proportion and exaggerated,\" Spicer said Monday. \"I know that everyone likes to get where they want to get to as quick as possible.

It also overlooks the hundreds of other people with legal visas or refugee status who were prevented from boarding flights to the U.S.\n\nThey also expressed concern that some people may have been deported under Trump's order, which would violate an emergency ruling by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York Saturday night that ordered the government to admit legal immigrants already in transit to the United States when Trump's executive order took effect.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.4897956848144505, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 663, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 17, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.709206715680001, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 8, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 51, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170130220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 7.692307692307691, "mft_mean": 4.63636363636}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/18/court-upholds-firing-over-muslim-headscarf/96745940/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Court upholds firing over Muslim headscarf", "wordcount_as_scraped": 744, "date": "20170119020000", "story_content": "CAMDEN, N.J. \u2014 An appeals court Wednesday upheld the firing of a Camden County corrections officer who said her Muslim beliefs required her to wear a head covering on duty.\n\nLinda Tisby, a 13-year employee at the county jail, contended her dismissal in May 2015 violated her rights under the state's Law Against Discrimination. Tisby, who was fired after adopting the Sunni Muslim faith, said county officials had failed to accommodate her \"sincere religious beliefs.\"\n\nBut a three-judge panel supported two Superior Court rulings against Tisby, saying the county had shown Tisby's head covering \u2014 known as a khimar or hijab \u2014 would impose an undue hardship on the jail. It said that circumstance created an exception to the state law, allowing Tisby's termination.\n\n\"We do not minimize the religious significance of the khimar for the women who wear them,\" the ruling said. \"We recognize a compelling sense of religious obligation in the decision to wear a khimar.\"\n\nThe panel agreed with a trial judge who found the jail's ban on khimars was justified \"because of overriding safety concerns, the potential for concealment of contraband and the importance of uniform neutrality.\"\n\nCounty officials were pleased with the ruling, said spokesman Dan Keashen.\n\n\"Our No. 1 priority is to ensure the safety of the employees and the inmates in the institution,\" he said. \"We believe, and the court was clear in its ruling, that this case would have compromised the health and welfare of all who work and live in the facility.\"\n\nDeborah Mains, a Mount Laurel attorney for Tisby, could not be reached for immediate comment.\n\nA spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a group that advocates for Muslims' civil rights, expressed concern.\n\n\"It's in our interest to make sure a negative precedent like this doesn't stand,\" said Ibrahim Hooper at the group's Washington, D.C., headquarters.\n\n\"Usually we find if there's good will on all sides, some kind of accommodation can be reached,\" said Hooper, who noted the New York City Police Department recently eased its dress code to allow turbans for Sikh officers.\n\n\"We've more or less resolved the issue of religious accommodation in what we call the corporate workplace,\" Hooper said. \"The only remaining issues are in the police and correctional institution settings where there's a uniform.\"\n\nAccording to Wednesday's decision, Tisby reported to work on May 1, 2015, in a khimar \u2014 described as \"a tight-fitting head covering without a veil.\" When Tisby refused a supervisor's order to remove the khimar, she was sent home and disciplinary charges were recommended.\n\nThe ruling said Tisby similarly refused orders to remove the head covering on May 2, 3 and 6, \"stating the khimar was for religious purposes.\" She then received a two-day suspension.\n\nThe jail's uniform policy allows only \"authorized head gear,\" the ruling noted.\n\nThe jail's warden, David S. Owens Jr., notified Tisby on May 11, 2015, that he considered her stance to be a \"request for accommodation under \u2026 the Civil Rights Act.\" but contended that would impose an undue hardship.\n\nOwens told Tisby she would face no disciplinary action if she returned to work without the khimar. She refused that offer and was removed from her position that same day, the ruling said.\n\nTisby then filed two court cases in June and July 2015, alleging the county had violated her rights and seeking reinstatement and back pay.\n\nOne case was dismissed on Aug. 7, 2015, after Superior Court Judge Anthony Pugliese found the county had proved an undue hardship. The other, which argued the jail had allowed other female workers to wear head coverings, was dismissed two weeks later by Superior Court Judge David Ragonese on the grounds that Tisby should have presented all of her arguments in a single case.\n\nIn upholding the lower court rulings, the appellate panel cited a federal court decision in a case brought in 2005 by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of Muslim women employed at a privately run jail in Pennsylvania. That ruling found khimars \"would present safety concerns in a prison setting because they could be used as a weapon to choke someone.\"\n\nWednesday's decision also noted a 2007 ruling against a Philadelphia police officer who sought to wear a khimar on duty.\n\nIn that case, Philadelphia's police commissioner asserted it was \"essential that the police maintain political and religious neutrality as they carry out their duties and must be seen by the public as not favoring one group or faith over another.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.18021202087402, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 735, "FairnessVirtue": 6, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.3673198504500004, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170119020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6734693877551003, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/22/womens-march-movement-able-transform-massive-crowds-into-lasting-legacy-trump/96920040/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1218, "scraper_regex": 1136}}, "headline": "Women's March movement: What's next and can the momentum last?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1136, "date": "20170122180000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Now that the Women's March on Washington is over, women like 32-year-old Jacqueline Glass will determine whether it marked a historic one-day demonstration or the start of a widespread resistance to Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nGlass was among the more than 2 million people who came out in a show of global protest \u2014 from Washington to Sydney, Australia. Now women's groups and civil rights organizations, such as Planned Parenthood and EMILY's List, are scrambling to harness that energy by enlisting more supporters and encouraging women to run for local public office.\n\nGlass, an African American who recently settled in Norfolk, Va., after retiring from the military, has felt off ever since the election, when her 10-year-old son woke up crying. \"I don't want him feeling like he's in a place where he's up against the world. This is America,\" she said. \"I was having these sinking feelings about the world and really down for a period of time,\" she said.\n\nThe feeling became so strong Glass took to Google, which led her to VoteRunLead, a New York nonprofit that grooms women for public office. She's now researching local commissions and boards in which to get active. \"I'm taking these tiny steps toward an ultimate goal,\" she said, which is to run for U.S. Senate.\n\nThere's early anecdotal evidence that some women are turning grief over the Election Day loss by Hillary Clinton into action. According to VoteRunLead, more than 2,300 women have signed up for training seminars in the past two months, a major increase. Planned Parenthood, which provides free health screening to poor women and is targeted by Republican leaders for funding cuts, is seeing hundreds of thousands of people signing up to volunteer and reach out to their members of Congress. EMILY's List, which works to elect pro-abortion-rights women, drew at least 500 women for a Sunday workshop in downtown Washington on running for office.\n\nWomen are more than half of the U.S. population, yet they hold fewer than one in four seats in the nation's state legislatures, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Running for office is just of many ways the event's organizers are hoping women will take action.\n\nFilmmaker Michael Moore gave the crowd a \"to-do list,\" including running for office and calling Congress on a daily basis to resist the Republican agenda. He urged marchers to turn their communities into \"regions of resistance\" to fight Republican policies and pass progressive laws on health care and anti-discrimination measures.\n\nRecently, in Speaker Paul Ryan's hometown of Janesville, Wis., 50 medical students in lab coats delivered a letter signed by 400 health care professionals to his office. Nearly 50% of the low-income counties served by Planned Parenthood have no alternative health-care provider. About 3% of its services are abortion-related, with the majority focused on providing contraception and screening for treating sexually transmitted diseases and infections.\n\nDespite these bursts in activism, the same thing that made the march an overwhelming success \u2014 it drew half a million in Washington alone, or twice as many as expected \u2014 also makes it hard to measure its long-term impact.\n\nMany of the women who streamed into Washington in buses, trains and planes are busy mothers, working professionals or older women who already fought the battle over women's rights in the 1960s. \"We won't live long enough, most of us, to see the damage done by any Supreme Court appointees that are going to be made during the Trump administration,\" said Marcelle Leahy, wife of Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. \"This is such an important time. You're all geared up and I want you to go home and keep on going,\" she told a breakfast before the march.\n\nMany marchers expressed interest in getting involved, but didn't have concrete plans. Joan Treistman, who came from New York City to the march, was heading for lunch with her friend and daughter. It was her first time in public activism, and she left resolved to stay active. She said she planned to be in contact with her senators and local lawmakers as well as talk more with her friends about issues important to her. She had mixed emotions leaving the parade.\n\n\"It's the intersection of exhilaration being at the parade, and sadness that we have to be so vigilant\" of government, she said.\n\nSamantha Schindler and Samantha Woodman flew all the way from Seattle. On their flights they connected with a group of people who do community outreach and they've decided to join. Claire Wexler, a social worker from Baltimore, said she intends to keep donating to Planned Parenthood. She also left the march compelled to contact her local lawmakers on issues.\n\nSince the mid-1970s, women greatly increased their numbers in state government. Yet, progress has slowed in recent years, and nationwide statistics show little or no growth in the numbers of women serving in state-level offices since the turn of the century, according to Rutgers data.\n\nThis may be partly due to the increasingly polarized nature of politics, says Erin Vilardi, who founded VoteRunLead. \"It doesn't look like a place where you can get anything done, so that's a turn off,\" she said. Women also tend to undervalue their qualifications, she said. Yet, since the election, her group has been overwhelmed. \"My cellphone rang for one week straight,\" said Vilardi. \"It was both in a sad way about not getting to the mountaintop, but also in a 'it's time for me' way,\" she said.\n\nTrump is also the first U.S. president with no military or government experience. Women are realizing \"I don't need to hold myself to these ridiculous standards. The ship is sinking, I've gotta jump on board,\" she said.\n\nThere's many causes to latch on to. The Women's March's platform calls for equal rights for women but also racial and economic equality; anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans; access to affordable reproductive health care, including contraception and abortion; criminal justice reform; an increase in the federal minimum wage; immigration reform; and protections for the environment.\n\nWhile the women who came to Washington cited broad concerns, a majority say it's still better to be a man in America and sexism remains a problem, according to the first major survey on gender following the election. Trump's Cabinet is 90% male and 90% white.\n\nAnd, according to the poll by the nonpartisan research firm, Perry Undem, the biggest predictor of getting more politically involved \u2014 more than ideology, age, gender, race and geography \u2014 is negative feelings about Trump's comments and past behavior toward women, including bragging about sexual assault.\n\n\"We always say that women run because they want to fix something or when they're mad as hell,\" said Muthoni Wambu Kraal, a senior director at EMILY's List. \"Watch out for the one who is both.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.7768361568450931, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1218, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.72838120989, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170122180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.6272577996715896, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/11/ray-tensing-samuel-dubose-trial/93651950/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 666, "scraper_regex": 710}}, "headline": "Deliberations in Tensing trial to continue Saturday", "wordcount_as_scraped": 710, "date": "20161111200000", "story_content": "CINCINNATI \u2014 Jurors deliberating in the murder trial of former University of Cincinnati Police Officer Ray Tensing Friday evening asked the judge presiding over the case for a definition of \"arrest.\"\n\nHamilton County Common Pleas Judge Megan Shanahan told jurors they have all they need to reach a verdict and sent them back to the jury room to resume deliberations.\n\nThe judge later dismissed jurors for the day. The jury were to be sequestered for another night and deliberations will resume at 8 a.m. Saturday.\n\nDeliberations have been ongoing since Wednesday and earlier Friday the jury indicated to the judge they could not reach an agreement on the murder charge or the voluntary manslaughter charge Tensing faces. Shanahan sent them back to deliberations following that exchange as well.\n\nTensing fatally shot Sam DuBose during a traffic stop in Mount Auburn on July 19, 2015. The key contention between the defense and the prosecution in the trial has been whether Tensing was dragged by DuBose's vehicle before he fired the fatal shot into DuBose's head.\n\nShanahan instructed them to return to the jury room and continue trying to reach a decision in the case against Ray Tensing.\n\n\"It's desirable that the case be decided,\" Shanhan said, reading a set of instructions given when a jury is unable to decide on a verdict. She encouraged jurors to \"reexamine\" their views and positions.\n\nIf a hung jury is ultimately declared, meaning they are hopelessly deadlocked, prosecutors would have to decide whether to re-try Tensing or drop the charges. Prosecutors have never said what they would do in the event of a hung jury.\n\nDaShonda Reid, DuBose's fiancee, was outside the courthouse when the announcement was made that jurors were deadlocked. A Black Lives Matter member, a white woman, told Reid she admired her grace and said she was \"with her family.\"\n\nReid responded: \"It's the strength of all my ancestors coming through me.\" Still, she said, \"It's obvious to me there are people in there who are blind to justice.\"\n\nAbout 75 people gathered outside the courthouse, 50 with Black Lives Matter: Cincinnati. News of the deadlocked jury was greeted by shouts of anger and small prayer groups. Some even cried.\n\nBrian Taylor, part of the Black Lives Matter group's steering committee, said he wasn't surprised.\n\n\"There is tension out here,\" Taylor said. He pledged a demonstration Friday regardless of the decision.\n\nReid urged calm and restraint.\n\n\"This is not the time for violence; not the time,\" she said.\n\nThree of Tensing's family members were in the courtroom for the announcement. No one from DuBose's family was there.\n\nAl Gerhardstein, who represented the family in civil proceedings related to DuBose's death, said no one from the family was notified that the jury was coming back.\n\n\"That's just wrong,\" said Gerhardstein. \"If the jury is in the courtroom, the family should be there. ... This is very stressful for the family. The system did not work. We need to get a better system in place.\"\n\nBishop Bobby Hilton, a local pastor who has been watching the case, said he believes the prosecution proved their case but cautioned that everyone needs to \"give the process a chance to work.\"\n\nAnything other than a guilty verdict, he added, would suggest \"we have problems in the justice system.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the jury asked a series of questions that Shanahan did not read in open court. She said the questions would have revealed the status and nature of their deliberations, indicating that jurors at that time were having difficulty reaching a unanimous decision. Jurors have been sequestered during deliberations.\n\nA jury expert said it's not uncommon that a deadlocked jury can't come to a decision.\n\n\"It can be maddening for the parties involved,'' said Douglas Keene, president of an Austin, Texas-based trial consulting business.\n\nTensing, 26, was charged last year with murder and voluntary manslaughter in the July 2015 shooting death of DuBose as he tried to drive away from a traffic stop for not having a front license plate.\n\nJurors began deliberating Wednesday afternoon in the trial, which began last week with opening statements.

It has avoided sensationalizing, historical facsimiles or anything that can't be meticulously documented.\n\n\"It's an approach that's based on the idea that people shouldn't be intimidated and shocked but informed in a matter of fact, factual way,\" said Hans-Christian Jasch, a former government lawyer and director of the House of the Wannsee Conference Memorial and Educational Site, a villa in southwest Berlin where 15 high-ranking Nazis conceived the plan to deport and kill Jews during World War II.\n\n\"It is not always necessary to show big piles of corpses,\" Jasch said. \"The point is not to overwhelm people with history, yet still grant them access to it.\"\n\nMuseums and exhibits in the United States, Britain and France often present information about Nazis and the Holocaust in a different way, said Hanna Liever, an adviser to Germany's federal agency for civic education who helps organize information about Holocaust memorial projects.\n\n\"They really try to work more on an emotional level, with replicas and other methods,\" she said, mentioning a film at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington that follows a boy growing up in Nazi Germany. The movie uses recreated scenes. \"In Germany, we are very strict about authenticity. We just wouldn't do that.\"\n\nStill, a replica of Adolf Hitler's bunker office where he spent his final days went on display last fall in an air raid shelter where Hitler had committed suicide on April 30, 1945. The replica in Berlin is part of a private initiative that includes a portrait of Hitler's favorite Prussian leader, Frederick the Great, an oxygen bottle with a mask and a statue of the Nazi leader's dog Blondi.\n\n\"A lot of people come to Berlin and think there is one central place where they can learn about Hitler or see some traces of what his life was like, but there isn't,\" said Enno Lenze, founder of the Berlin Bunker Story, the company behind the display. \"People want to know all the details, even about the rumors, if they are accurate or not. There needs to be an exhibition about Hitler himself, because he was the one who more or less caused World War II and whose death ended it.\"\n\nCritics have accused organizers of showing a lack of respect for \"objective\" history.\n\nKay-Uwe von Damaros, a spokesman for the Topography of Terror, a museum in Berlin located on the site that housed the Gestapo secret police and Hitler's SS paramilitaries, said Lenze's replica, which he has not seen, was not something his institution would consider doing.\n\nGerman authorities have resisted creating a single repository for information about Hitler, worrying that neo-Nazis could turn it into a shrine.\n\nLenze said he is providing a teaching experience. \"The Topography of Terror has a lot of text and a lot pictures, and the content is great. But let's face it: If there's a school class, they don't want to read all this stuff. They want to listen to someone who can show and tell them about Hitler in an accessible way.\"\n\nGermany has more than 2,000 memorial sites, including Wannsee, noting the Nazi-committed horrors that killed 6 million Jews and millions of others during World War II, according to the Berlin-based International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.\n\nIn 2017, Germany will spend about $21 million running and conserving these sites, according to the department of culture and media.\n\n\"Germany makes absolutely no attempt to cover up. It's an exemplar in its openness for dealing with its difficult and conflicted past,\" said John Lennon, a professor at Glasgow University whose research focuses on people attracted to sites of mass killing, genocide and assassinations. \"There is a very high willingness to debate the past, such as do you let the ruins crumble or do you shore them up? There is also almost an obsession with documentation and evidence.\"\n\n\"The number of sales has completely overwhelmed us. No one could have predicted it,\" Andreas Wirsching, the institute's director, told the German news agency DPA. The institute said the book has been bought by political and history buffs and educators, not \"reactionaries or right-wing radicals.\"\n\nAs the Nazi era recedes in time, Germans have been more willing to explore and question their own family history, said historian Oliver von Wrochem, who heads a research center that studies the Neuengamme concentration camp near Hamburg. Over the past five years, he said a small, but increasing number of people are asking him to help find more about what their relatives did during the war.\n\n\"A book like mine would probably have been possible 10 years ago here, but not 20. But I don't think there's necessarily some huge demand in Germany for dealing with Hitler or the Nazis in the way I did,\" Vermes said.\n\nChristoph Kreutzm\u00fcller, a curator at the Jewish Museum of Berlin, said the Nazi era is becoming \"normal history,\" allowing Germans to talk about it with less trepidation.\n\n\"Modern history is defined by eyewitnesses being there. And as they have disappeared, it has changed things. It is not the society's parents anymore. It's not even the society's grandparents anymore. It's the society's great-grandparents who did something, and most of us have a very weak connection to them,\" he said.\n\nJasch, the director of the Wannsee memorial, said he is working with a production company on the idea of installing screens in the villa to show short biographical films on the Nazi officials who attended the meeting 75 years ago.\n\n\"I'm concerned about it, but I'm still supporting it,\" Jasch said. \"People have an urge to 're-live' history in this way.

But first, let's dig into actual news that everyone agrees actually happened in real life, then we'll pick out some of the highlights of the thing, including some solid reasons why this thing didn't make it to the forefront before Election Day.\n\nLet's get started ...\n\nHomeland Security nominee: Wall not enough; we need to build a roof\n\nTuesday was the start of confirmation hearings for Donald Trump's cabinet appointees. First up: Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security nominee John Kelly\n\nSessions distanced himself both from his own past statements and a handful of Trump's campaign promises. He said allegations were false that he sympathized with the KKK, and said his views on racial equality were caricatured in a Senate hearing for a 1986 federal judgeship. He also said Muslims shouldn't be denied entry to the U.S. based on their religion, and that it would be financially impossible to remove all illegal immigrants from the U.S.\n\n\"We will prosecute those who repeatedly violate our borders,'' the nominee told the panel. Hear that, foreigners? You can violate our borders ONCE, and that's it. Jeff Sessions confirms it.\n\nMeanwhile, Department of Homeland Security nominee John Kelly said much the same thing about deporting undocumented immigrants \u2014 it's too expensive. And he doesn't think the wall will do the trick either, citing the need for patrols, sensors and better relations with southern neighbors. He also said he didn't think children brought illegally by their parents would be a priority for deportation. \"There's a big spectrum of people who need to be dealt with in terms of deportations ... I would guess that this category wouldn't be the highest priority for removal,\" he said.\n\nObama to America: Avenge me!\n\nEight years and three miles removed from his 2008 victory speech in Chicago, President Obama delivered what is likely his last major public address. But instead of the celebratory flair of the original speech, Obama defended his legacy after watching the nation go red in November. Obama touched on the economic recovery, renewed relations with Cuba, the death of Osama bin Laden and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"That's what we did,\" he said. \"That's what you did. You were the change. Because of you, by almost every measure, America is a stronger, better place than it was when we started.\"\n\nObama lashed out against the us-vs.-them mentality as inconsistent with democracy:\n\n\"For blacks and other minorities, it means tying our own struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face \u2014 the refugee, the immigrant, the rural poor, the transgender American, and also the middle-aged white man who from the outside may seem like he's got all the advantages, but who's seen his world upended by economic, cultural, and technological change.\n\n\"For white Americans, it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didn't suddenly vanish in the '60s; that when minority groups voice discontent, they're not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness; that when they wage peaceful protest, they're not demanding special treatment, but the equal treatment our Founders promised.\n\n\"For native-born Americans, it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants today were said, almost word for word, about the Irish, Italians, and Poles. America wasn't weakened by the presence of these newcomers; they embraced this nation's creed, and it was strengthened.\n\nObama even addressed the charges of \"fake news\" that both sides have leveled against the other:\n\n\"Increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we accept only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that's out there,\" he said. The \"selective sorting of the facts\" was self-defeating, he said, \"because as my mother used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.\"\n\nOh, and speaking of \"selective sorting of facts\" ...\n\nBuzzFeed's Believe It or Not!\n\nFAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017\n\nIf you're wondering why everyone at work today is suddenly interested in news about Trump and Russia, here's why: BuzzFeed published a 35-page secret dossier on Trump's ties to Russia, allegedly compiled by a former British intelligence official intended for use by opposing candidates last year. We say \"allegedly\" because the document has been making the rounds through Washington and various news outlets for months, and yet nothing in it has been independently verified. Former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) hinted at the document in an October letter to FBI Director James Comey, and Mother Jones wrote about it in broad strokes in an October article.\n\nTo BuzzFeed's credit, their own report called the dossier \"unverified\" and has \"clear errors\" (among them, the frequent misspelling of a Putin-allied investment group and the description of an exclusive Moscow suburb. Why did they run with it, then? \"(S)o that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the U.S. government.\"\n\nBuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith tweeted out a note he sent to his staff about why the site chose to publish the dossier, including several lines that read more like \"reasons we shouldn't have published.\"\n\nHere's the note I sent to @buzzfeednews staff this evening pic.twitter.com/OcAloWzVzb\u2014 Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) January 11, 2017\n\nOut of 35 pages, not one aspect was confirmed ... but it was published anyway.

But he also told Chicago's WBBM that racial incidents get more attention now \"in part because we see visuals of racial tensions, violence and so forth because of smart phones and the Internet.\"\n\nObama gave a round of interviews with Chicago television stations as he prepares to deliver his farewell address in his hometown next Tuesday. But the interviews were dominated by racial issues and urban violence.\n\n\"What we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time,\" he said.\n\nIn a separate interview with WLS, he recalled the racially polarizing Chicago \"Council Wars\" of the 1980s. \"Some of your viewers are too young to remember this stuff. I promise you, for the most part, race relations have gotten better.\"\n\nObama said the violence plaguing Chicago was heartbreaking, but also a \"strange exception\" to the national trends.

I want to be a part of the solution.\"\n\nObama is building his presidential library in Chicago's Jackson Park neighborhood.\n\n\"These are communities I know and love, and there's so many good people there,\" he told WLS. \"And there are people I know who have been personally affected by levels of violence.\"\n\nThe interviews were part of Obama's \"Live from the White House\" strategy, which has brought 155 local television and radio reporters to the White House for one-on-one interviews, according to a USA TODAY tally. At times, he brought so many reporters to the White House that he needed cue cards to keep their names and cities straight.\n\nThose appearances, mostly during his first term, allowed him to bypass the national media and target his message to local communities on topics like Obamacare, the minimum wage and trade.\n\nBut until Thursday, Obama had done only one interview with a Chicago station during his presidency. The interviews focused on Chicago issues but also covered some other topics:\n\n\u25ba On the tensions between President-elect Donald Trump and the intelligence community: \"My experience over the last eight years and the experience of most presidents is we cant make good decisions unless we have good intelligence,\" he told WMAQ. \"And it's important that the president is getting the very best non-politicized intelligence possible, because national security is at stake.\"\n\nBut he also said he's also optimistic that \"some of those current tensions will be reduced\" once Trump starts getting his briefings from his own hand-picked intelligence officials.\n\n\u25ba On a commutation for former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, convicted of trying to sell Obama's former senate seat: \"We have steps that go from the Justice Department and the White House counsel's office, and then I study these cases on an individual basis,\" he told WMAQ.. \"On some of these high profile cases, we'll see what gets to my desk.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.742942035198212, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 602, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.86682138703, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170106000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.81727574750831, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/08/opening-arguments-begin-ny-21m-wrongful-death-lawsuit/93490794/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 671, "scraper_regex": 612}}, "headline": "Jury seated in N.Y. $21M wrongful death lawsuit; witnesses set to testify", "wordcount_as_scraped": 612, "date": "20161108220000", "story_content": "WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. \u2014 A jury has been seated and the trial has opened in a long-awaited $21 million federal wrongful death lawsuit brought by the family of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr., a 68-year-old retired corrections officer who was shot and killed by White Plains police in his apartment five years ago.\n\n\"I walk in (the federal courthouse in White Plains) knowing that we will have victory...\" Kenneth Chamberlain Jr. said in a Facebook Live video stream he made shortly before heading inside. \"This will not just be a win for my family, this will be a win for many people...\"\n\nLawyers made opening statements in the case late Monday; the first witnesses are expected to be called to the stand Wednesday morning.\n\nChamberlain Sr., an African-American Marine Corps veteran, was killed on Nov. 19, 2011, when police said he charged at an officer with a knife following an early morning standoff at his apartment. He'd already been shot with a stun gun and beanbags \"the force of a Mike Tyson punch,\" according to his lawyers, when Officer Anthony Carelli shot and killed him as he allegedly charged at another officer. The alleged shooter, Officer Carelli, could be called to trial this week.\n\nPolice were dispatched to the apartment after Chamberlain's life alert device went off. When they arrived, Chamberlain Sr., who had a heart ailment, mental illness and substance abuse problems, told police he was OK and did not need help. Authorities said that because Chamberlain was ranting and appeared to be talking to others in the apartment, they had to check on his welfare before they could leave.\n\nChamberlain, who had been drinking, refused to open his door and became increasingly agitated as the standoff continued, allegedly thrusting a knife and cleaver through the chained apartment door and threatening to kill the first officer to enter.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that police cursed and used racial slurs to taunt Chamberlain Sr., needlessly escalating the situation. Family lawyers say officers did not allow family members to try and calm him down by telephone, or allow a relative who also lived in the building to speak with him.\n\nSome audio and video of the confrontation was captured on Chamberlain Sr.'s life alert device and the police stun gun.\n\nEventually, police forced open the apartment door and fired the stun gun at Chamberlain Sr., who they said was standing in the hallway in his underwear, brandishing a knife. After that failed to bring him down, police said, Chamberlain Sr. was then hit with beanbags from a shotgun as police moved inside. He was finally shot and killed by Carelli when police said he charged at another officer with a kitchen knife.\n\nLawyers for the family say the force of the beanbags knocked Chamberlain to the floor and that evidence will show he was still lying there when the fatal shots were fired, and could not have been charging at police.\n\nThe Chamberlain family filed the federal lawsuit against the city and the police after a Westchester County grand jury chose not to indict any of the officers involved on criminal charges.\n\nIn court actions leading up to the trial, U.S. District Judge Cathy Seibel dismissed many of the lawsuit's claims, including those against all of the officers except for Carelli. She's also ruled that some evidence will not be admitted during the trial.\n\nBoth Andrew Quinn, Carelli's lawyer, and Lalit Looma, the attorney for the city, have denied the remaining claims in the suit.\n\nChamberlain's family is being represented by lawyers Randolph McLaughlin and Debra Cohen, both of the Newman Ferrara firm, and White Plains attorney Mayo Bartlett.\n\nThe trial is expected to take two weeks.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.23373126983643, "HarmVice": 10, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 671, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.5628941713199995, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161108220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.57675111773472, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/11/21/antitrust-trial-over-aetna-cigna-merger-begins/94222422/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Antitrust trial over Anthem-Cigna merger begins", "wordcount_as_scraped": 827, "date": "20161121200000", "story_content": "Government antitrust lawyers went to federal court Monday for the start of a trial in their quest to block Anthem's proposed acquisition of Cigna, a merger that could create the nation's largest health insurance company and potentially reshape the U.S. market for employer-provided health coverage.\n\nIndianapolis-based Anthem (ANTM), which wants to consolidate the private health insurance market to gain scale, said the deal would give the combined companies better leverage for extracting improved pricing from doctors and hospitals that could be passed on to customers. Anthem would also have to pay a $1.85 billion break-up fee to Bloomfield, Conn.-based Cigna (CI) if the deal is not approved.\n\nIn July 2015, Anthem agreed to pay $54 billion to buy Cigna to create a gigantic for-profit insurer with annual revenues of more than $115 billion and more than 53 million insured patients. The deal is now valued at roughly $48 billion.\n\nThe two insurers cover about 17% of the U.S. population. As a result, the Justice Department and several state attorneys general sued to block the deal on antitrust grounds, leading to Monday's opening of a bench trial before Judge Amy Berman Jackson at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nFederal regulators argue that consolidation of the market for private health insurance for employers and individuals \"would substantially lessen competition, harming millions of American consumers, as well as doctors and hospitals,\" according to the Justice Department's filing.\n\nAmericans spend more than $3 trillion on health care each year, and about half of all Americans get their coverage from employers. Individuals who aren't tied to their employers' plans also can buy coverage from the insurance market exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile federal regulators review all major mergers and acquisition proposals, few mergers get to this point as companies and the government negotiate divestitures and other terms assuage antitrust concerns. Anthem has acknowledged that it has \"ongoing dialogue\" with the Justice Department and state regulators about the merger.\n\n\"This antitrust trial will be significant first and foremost simply because it is going to trial,\" says Anthony Sabino, a business professor at St. John's University in New York. \"This rarely happens. So, whatever the outcome just the fact this is going to court is significant. \"\n\nIn written pretrial legal briefs, Anthem and Cigna stuck to their initial argument that the merger would lead to lower costs for consumers.\n\n\"The U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and a handful of State AGs seek to enjoin a merger they acknowledge is likely to reduce health care costs for millions of working Americans,\" the companies said. \"Thus, this is an extraordinary action in which federal and state competition authorities are, according to their own allegations, seeking to deprive American consumers of lower health care costs.\"\n\nThe health insurance industry is now dominated by five companies. Four of the five have proposed to merge, raising uncertainty about the sector's future amid President-elect Donald Trump's promises to remake much of the current health care insurance laws, starting with amending or eliminating the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Anthem-Cigna trial also serves as a preview for a similar antitrust proceeding over the proposed merger of Aetna and Humana. That trial is set to begin next month.\n\nAnthem, which is the largest member of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, operates in 14 states with Blue-branded plans, and markets other health plans in other states. \"Anthem has also earned a reputation in many markets for having poor customer service, being slow to innovate, and being difficult to work with for doctors and hospitals,\" the Department of Justice said in its pretrial brief.\n\nCigna \"increasingly competes head to head with Anthem by finding innovative ways to lower its customers' medical costs,\" the DOJ filing said. The company's efforts \"have been well received by consumers and healthcare providers, pressuring Anthem to respond.\"\n\nCigna and Anthem representatives couldn't immediately be reached for comment Monday.\n\nFederal regulators have also argued that approving the merger would particularly limit market options for large employers. The companies often represent often two of the few remaining options for large-group employers in at least 35 metropolitan areas, government lawyers said. \"In some of these areas, Cigna has won most of its new accounts from Anthem, and Anthem has described Cigna as 'aggressive' and 'our number one competitor,'\" the DOJ's pretrial filing said.\n\nThe merger could also irrevocably alter individual exchanges, as Anthem and Cigna are key competitors in at least two major markets \u2014 St. Louis and Denver. Cigna has about 25% of the market share in St. Louis, and much of it has come at the expense of Anthem, government lawyers said.\n\nRegardless of the trial outcome, the pending change of presidential administrations could determine the companies' corporate future.\n\n\"For now, the Obama administration is running the show,\" said Sabino. \"But soon the Trump administration will take over the Justice Department, and Republican administrations have a long history of being merger friendly.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.107874862849712, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 814, "FairnessVirtue": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.06505758029, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161121200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.57985257985258, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/08/todd-kohlhepp-psychology-serial-killer/93466404/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "S.C. murders: The psychology of a suspected serial killer", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1136, "date": "20161108150000", "story_content": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Could a serial killer have operated undetected in South Carolina for more than a decade?\n\nWith the arrest of Todd Christopher Kohlhepp on murder charges stemming from the deaths of four people at Superbike Motorsports 13 years ago and the discovery of three bodies on his Spartanburg County, S.C., property, some wonder how a killer could elude capture for years.\n\nThe answer, experts say, is that it is not uncommon for serial killers to go undetected, in part because they blend so well into their communities and sometimes take pauses from their crimes that can last months or years.\n\nIn fact, these \"cooling off\" periods used to be part of the definition of serial killers to distinguish them from mass murderers, which the FBI defines as the murder of at least four people in a single incident. Serial killers are those who kill at least two people in separate incidents, according to the agency.\n\nOne of the bodies discovered on Kohlhepp's 95-acre property near Woodruff was that of Charles Carver, missing since late August. Authorities have not identified the other two bodies or said when they might have been killed.\n\nExperts said it is highly unusual for a serial killer to begin with a mass murder.\n\n\"This is one of a kind, extremely rare,\" said Dr. Eric Hickey, who has studied serial killers for 35 years and assisted law enforcement and the FBI.\n\nEnzo Yaksic, who runs Northeastern University's Murder Accountability Project and has built a database on serial killers for use by law enforcement, described that pattern as \"incredibly uncommon.\"\n\n\"I don't think I've seen that in any other case before,\" he said.\n\nExperts said many serial killers appear so normal they don't raise suspicions and sometimes cultivate that appearance in what amounts to be dual lives.\n\nDr. Helen Morrison, an expert on serial killers who said she has interviewed 115 of them, said serial killers often go undetected because of their apparent normalcy.\n\n\"In fact, most people are shocked when they find the person who is finally arrested because they will say he is a very nice person, he didn't cause any trouble,\" she said. \"They are able to be chameleons. They can manage to live a life undetected.\"\n\nThat also was the finding of a five-day symposium on serial killers hosted by the FBI in 2005 attended by 135 experts, including Hickey.\n\n\"The majority of serial killers are not reclusive social misfits who live alone. They are not monsters and may not appear strange. Many serial killers hide in plain sight within their communities,\" the FBI wrote in its summary of the discussions, which serves as a reference guide on serial killers.\n\nAs evidence, the agency pointed to several serial killers who eluded authorities for years:\n\nThe \"Green River Killer,\" Gary Ridgeway, confessed to killing 48 women over a 20-year time period in the Seattle area, according to the FBI. He had been married three times and was still married at the time of his arrest, the agency said.\n\nThe \"BTK Killer,\" Dennis Rader, killed 10 victims in and around Wichita, Kan., according to the FBI. He was married with two children, was a Boy Scout leader, served honorably in the U.S. Air Force, was employed as a local government official, and was president of his church.\n\nMorrison said serial killers appear so \"vanilla\" that they do not stick out to law enforcement.\n\n\"Every time I go into one of these people, I find myself saying, 'Oh, he couldn't possibly be a serial murderer,' \" she said. \"They seem utterly normal.\"\n\nBut if you talk to them for several hours, she said, that mask disappears.\n\nExperts say there is no single profile that fits all serial killers, though there are common traits. Myths abound, they say, such as the popular misconception of a serial killer who is a highly intelligent white male motivated by sex.\n\nWhile many are white males, Hickey said, about half the serial killers in this country are African American.\n\nMorrison said that the majority are males, but many lack advanced education and many have no criminal record as an adult, though they may have had brushes with the law as juveniles. They often sport a middle-class lifestyle, she said, and have few close friends but are not recluses and are expert manipulators.\n\n\"They can talk their way out of or into anything,\" she said.\n\nKohlhepp, a white male who sold real estate, lived a middle-class lifestyle and had no criminal record as an adult.\n\n\"Most serial killers are or have been married, frequently have arrest records and are often forthcoming upon capture, either out of pride or relief that their campaign can end,\" Yaksic said.\n\nAccording to the FBI, there is no single thing that motivates serial killers, and they are not driven solely by sex. Though Hickey believes about half of all serial killers are sexual predators.\n\nYaksic said many of the behaviors at the root of serial killers emerge when they are young, though they sometimes go undetected.\n\nKohlhepp's mother talked of his behavior problems throughout his childhood, including outbursts of rage, according to court records. He was convicted at 16 of kidnapping in connection with the rape of a 14-year-old neighbor in Arizona.\n\n\"His parents understood Todd to have a great deal of anger, but the full breadth of what he is capable of cannot be known until much later in life when his behavior is not consistently monitored by others,\" Yaksic said.\n\nExperts say one common trait of serial killers is lack of remorse. Morrison said they feel little empathy for others, including their victims.\n\n\"They would never, ever experience sadness or anything related to that,\" she said.\n\nThe FBI says it is a myth that serial killers are geniuses who out-smart law enforcement or that they suffer from mental illness.\n\n\"As a group, serial killers suffer from a variety of personality disorders, including psychopathy, anti-social personality, and others,\" the FBI wrote of the experts' opinions. \"Most, however, are not adjudicated as insane under the law.\"\n\nKohlhepp was diagnosed as an adolescent with some anti-social personality traits but no mental illness, records show.

G.K. Butterfield, D-N.C., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. \"We're bracing for a fight, without question, because we have no other evidence to believe that he will change his positions and his rhetoric. He seems to be doubling down on those.''\n\nVoting rights and civil rights leaders have called emergency meetings, hosted news conferences and started developing strategies to preserve what they call hard-fought gains. They say they're particularly alarmed by President-elect Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric during the campaign and his remarks about minorities and women.\n\nThey're also concerned about the track record of Trump's potential cabinet picks and his appointment of Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon had headed Breitbart News, which critics say has racist and anti-Semitic content. Civil rights groups also slammed Trump's choice Friday of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as attorney general, the nation's top law enforcement official.\n\nOne pressing concern, say activists, is the fight to protect voting rights, an issue on the front-burner since the U.S. Supreme Court three years ago struck down a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n\nIn the wake of reports of problems at the polls Election Day, voting rights activists say Congress should take up legislation that would restore the provision and make voting easier. Despite its dim prospects, Democrats plan to push for action on the bill during the lame-duck session.\n\nRepublican leaders say they support voting rights, but certain Voting Rights Act provisions are outdated and shouldn't be revived. They argue the law has safeguards against voting discrimination.\n\nCivil rights leaders and Democrats concede the legislation isn't likely to come to the floor for a vote or even a hearing.\n\n\"It's going to be extremely tough,'' said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP Washington Bureau. \"But we have to try anyway \u2026 The push is going to be on.''\n\nShelton and others hope recent problems at the polls spur Congress to act. A coalition of civil rights groups fielded thousands of calls from voters with questions and complaints.\n\n\"To have the House turn its back on this kind of information and fail to act is absolutely unconscionable,'' said Wade Henderson, president of The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200 groups.\n\nHenderson said activists are willing to work with Trump on issues, such as college affordability, criminal justice reform and infrastructure needs, \"but we will not accept efforts to roll back civil rights \u2014 not on our watch.''\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., has not said whether he will allow a vote on voting rights legislation. His office did not reply to a request for comment.\n\n\"I do not believe that the next Congress will be any better on that subject than this Congress has been,'' said South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the assistant Democratic leader. \"I'm not too sure that there's going to be a legislative fix.''\n\nClyburn said he's praying the next Supreme Court justice has a \"different attitude about voting rights. I won't hold my breath.''\n\nMelanie Campbell, executive director of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said a coalition of mostly women's groups plans to work on a strategy to protect voting rights and address other concerns, including Bannon's appointment.\n\n\"We now face a period of uncertainty,'' Campbell said. \"We will continuously, vigorously fight for issues of civil rights and social justice as part of our mission.''", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.5151515007018999, "HarmVice": 4, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 687, "FairnessVirtue": 25, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.98167613492, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 25, "mft_sum": 52, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161118220000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 7.56914119359534, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/18/supreme-court-terrorist-attacks-911-bush-ashcroft-muslim/96727278/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Supreme Court justices favor Bush officials in Sept. 11 detainee case", "wordcount_as_scraped": 605, "date": "20170118210000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Six Supreme Court justices relived Wednesday the calamitous months following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and most seemed inclined to forgive Bush administration officials for the harsh treatment of Middle Eastern men later found to be innocent.\n\nArguing its last case before the high court, President Obama's Justice Department said former attorney general John Ashcroft and others should not be held personally liable for decisions made in the climate of fear that followed the attacks in New York and Washington.\n\nThat appeared to be a winning argument against claims brought by six Muslim non-citizens who were among hundreds jailed in extremely harsh conditions because they fit the same racial and religious profile of the 9/11 hijackers.\n\n\"National security policy in response to the 9/11 attacks ... was to detain people,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said. \"Every one of the individuals detained was in violation of their immigration status.\"\n\nThe case, which has bounced around the federal court system for 15 years, was heard by only six justices in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia's death last February and the recusal of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Both apparently worked on the case before ascending to the court -- Sotomayor as a federal judge in New York, Kagan as U.S. solicitor general.\n\nIn another twist, the lawyer representing the undocumented immigrants was Rachel Meeropol, granddaughter of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted as Soviet spies and executed in 1953 during the height of McCarthyism.\n\nMeeropol told the justices that federal officials targeted Muslims and Arabs for harsh treatment in the months after the terrorist attacks. Top officials -- including Ashcroft and former FBI director Robert Mueller -- received daily reports and quickly learned they were not terrorists, she said. For that reason, they should be held personally liable for monetary damages.\n\nAfter eight months, she said, \"everybody was cleared and deported, as one would expect from a policy that is not based on ... actual suspicion, but is rather a blunderbuss attempt to gather all of the Muslim and Arab non-citizens whom one has authority over by virtue of their immigration detentions and hold them in restrictive conditions of confinement while they are treated as suspected terrorists.\"\n\nActing Solicitor General Ian Gershengorn told the justices that in the days after the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, \"you couldn't tell ... who did and who did not have a potential link to terrorism.\"\n\n\"In that situation, a decision to hold everyone until cleared ... is best explained, not by invidious intent, but by the desire to avoid the premature and inadvertent release of a dangerous terrorist,\" he said.\n\nBreyer and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the only liberals among the six justices hearing the case, had tough questions for Gershengorn, though they clearly were in the minority.\n\n\"You know from day one that many of them have nothing to do with terrorists, and yet you allow that system that might have been justified in October to persist for months and months, when these people are being held in the worst possible conditions of confinement,\" Ginsburg said.\n\n\"Suppose it had been five years,\" Breyer said. \"Suppose it had been 10 years.\"\n\nThe justices appeared less sympathetic to separate claims brought against the men responsible for conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where the Muslim non-citizens were held.\n\nAlthough their lawyer, Jeffrey Lamken, acknowledged that \"misconduct occurred,\" he argued that wardens Dennis Hasty and James Sherman could not have been expected to overrule FBI directives.\n\nBut Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote could be critical, said it appeared that Hasty did not inspect conditions in order to be \"willfully blind.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.499276638031009, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 604, "FairnessVirtue": 6, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.43294683427, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 11, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170118210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.794701986754969, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/04/flagstaff-officer-resigns-punching-woman/96177500/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Police officer who punched woman turns in his badge", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1418, "date": "20170105020000", "story_content": "PHOENIX \u2014 A Flagstaff police officer has resigned after an independent report criticized his actions in punching a woman he was trying to arrest, authorities said.\n\nOfficer Jeff Bonar resigned Tuesday after the department recommended his termination, Flagstaff Police Chief Kevin Treadway said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nFlagstaff police received a copy of an independent investigation into Bonar's actions shortly after the Northern Arizona University police department submitted it to the Coconino County Attorney's Office.\n\nThe Coconino County Attorney's Office asked the Mohave County Attorney's Office to review the report to determine if charges should be brought.\n\nThe Nov. 16 altercation between Bonar and Marisa Morris of Flagstaff has been under scrutiny for weeks.\n\nBonar was placed on administrative leave shortly before the incident was captured on camera and posted on Facebook. Bonar had gone to Morris' home that afternoon to assist a Coconino County sheriff's deputy serve an eviction notice but ended up arresting Morris on suspicion of aggravated assault and resisting arrest.\n\nIn his report, he wrote he believed Morris had a warrant out for her arrest and he was trying to apprehend her when she began to struggle, kicking him multiple times in the groin and knees. His strikes were \"distraction blows,\" in return, he wrote.\n\nThe investigation into Bonar's actions was conducted by NAU Sgt. Michael O'Hagan, who concluded that the two fist strikes from Bonar to Morris' face \"do not appear to be reasonable, or necessary to make the arrest, in accordance with Officer Bonar's department policy or state law.\"\n\nNeither Coconino Sheriff's Office Sgt. Bill Rackly and Deputy Joel Winchester, who had been at the scene with Bonar, corroborated his claims. Neither of them observed Morris assaulting Bonar as he depicted in his report.\n\nA witness said he didn't see Morris make contact with Bonar from where he stood, but said he saw Bonar react in a way as if he had been hit in the groin, the report states.\n\nHowever, Bonar contended in an interview with O'Hagan that her assaults came before the video was recording.\n\nO'Hagan writes how Winchester had one of Morris' arms, Bonar the other, and that another officer was en route. The level of force shown by Bonar was not neccesary to make the arrest, the report said.\n\nHe defined Morris' behavior as \"defensive resistance,\" as she was hiding her hands and breaking free from Bonar's grip. Nothing the video was able to support that she was using \"active aggression,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Marissa in the video does not appear to rise to the levels \u2026 according to (Flagstaff police) policy \u2026 it would prohibit the officer from 'head and neck strikes,'\" O'Hagan stated.\n\nMorris' reaction to the strikes is described to be of shock; she stands still with her mouth open as she does not retaliate.\n\n\"I watched the video, and after slowing it down and zooming in, found that the skin-colored flash that everyone thought was Marissa kicking or kneeling Officer Bonar just prior to this punch, was actually her hand as she struggled to break free from Officer Bonar,\" O'Hagan wrote.\n\nBonar's behavior under scrutiny\n\nBonar's behavior that afternoon was described as \"frazzled,\" by the men who assisted him in Morris' arrest. Despite his experience, his demeanor was more like he had recently become an officer and this was his first physical altercation.\n\nWinchester reported that he arrived in the area that afternoon to assist in a \"lock out,\" an eviction in which the residents were asked to be removed immediately. He said he requested Flagstaff police send an officer in case he needed assistance.\n\nHe said that Bonar was not familiar with a \"lock out,\" and that he took time to explain the situation to him before they made contact with a man in the area.\n\nWinchester said he didn't anticipate any issues in the process when the man was cooperative. However, in that moment, Bonar observed a woman walking by that Bonar said had a warrant for her arrest.\n\nWhile he couldn't hear what they were saying, Winchester said he observed the woman, Morris, shake her head before she turned to leave or go inside the residence. He said Bonar then reached out and grabbed her by the arm and detained her, preventing her from going further.\n\nWinchester then described that the two walked further up the driveway, where they ended up in a \"confined space\" between a vehicle and porch. As he approached them, Winchester said the struggle ensued.\n\nBonar was trying to explain that Morris had a warrant but Morris denied that she did, the report stated. Bonar then grabbed her wrists and tried to place them behind her, but Morris continued to struggle as Bonar asked her to comply.\n\nWhen Winchester asked Morris not to fight, she replied that she wasn't, as she continued to resist.\n\nThen he saw Bonar pull out a stun gun and that it came between all three of them, the report said.\n\nMorris saw the Taser as well. She backed up and said, \"Oh, no,\" Winchester said.\n\nThen he saw Bonar's fist make contact with her chin.\n\nWhile Winchester said Morris was surprised at this, he said that the punch \"didn't seem to have much effect on her,\" as she continued again to resist.\n\nBonar brought out his handcuffs and the two men worked together to successfully place them on her wrists.\n\nRackley said he arrived and approached as both Bonar and Winchester were in struggling with Morris. He described how the officers were in a \"tight area\" and that the people on the porch were yelling and looking down at them, making him concerned from an officer safety position.\n\nAsked if he observed any resistance from Morris, Rackley explained there was pushing, pulling and \"avoiding anyone taking any control.\"\n\nHe said Morris made it difficult as she continue to plant her feet in front of her and kick the side of the car as they attempted to place her in the back seat of a patrol car.\n\n\"You can't take me \u2026 there is no warrant,\" Rackley said Morris repeated.\n\nBonar defends actions to investigator\n\nIn his interview with O'Hagan, Bonar cited Morris' \"erratic behavior\" and the fact that he was larger than she was and he was losing the fight, unable to detain her. He stated he believed she was stimulated by drugs. He explained how Morris's \"jitteryness and the erratic yelling,\" appeared to him that she was on something, along with her dilated pupils.\n\nBonar said he definitely remembered being struck twice by her knee, once in the leg and again in the groin. He said Morris was kicking and probably striking him, although the blows weren't significant or painful, he said.\n\nBonar said he was struggling for a minute before Winchester arrived to assist him. He said for he struggled with Morris' hands as she tried to conceal them.\n\nBonar demonstrated how he placed his hands on Morris' neck, with his right arm up and his hand cocked to the right with his thumb up and open away from himself\n\nHe said the tactic was to create distance.\n\n\"It wasn't a choke, it wasn't a strike, it was just part of the struggle of me trying to get away from her,\" he said.\n\nBonar said he struck Morris then two times, with a short pause between the two punches. The first contact \"got the effect he wanted,\" he said, although he said he only used 30 percent of his available power.\n\nHis goal was \"whatever the case may be to help me win the fight,\" Bonar said.\n\nAfter the strikes were delivered, Bonar said he thought the men on the porch was going to join the melee, so he drew his stun gun and activated it. He said he threatened to use it, but did not intend to.\n\nOn the way to the jail, Bonar said Morris kept talking about how she didn't have warrants and couldn't be arrested. He said he was finally able to run her name through dispatch once he got the the jail.\n\nBonar described how he struggled to breathe after the exchange with Morris, and that he considered calling for the medics on the drive over to the jail. But once he caught his breath, he said, he notified his supervisor about what had occurred, he said.\n\n\"Officer Bonar caused Ms. Morris physical and emotional harm.

After his training, he was deployed to South Korea in late November 1950 with the 3rd Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division.\n\nShortly after his arrival in Korea, Martin's unit engaged in a fierce battle with members of the Communist Chinese army at Chosin Reservoir.\n\nBy Dec. 2, nearly 1,500 U.S. soldiers were evacuated from the area. Because Martin could not be accounted for by his unit at the end of the battle, he was reported missing in action as of Dec. 3, 1950.\n\n\"We really didn't talk a whole lot about this throughout my life,\" Ronald Martin said. \"For the longest time, his mother always felt in her heart that he was still alive. She knew he was still with us.\"\n\nAfter his family found out that Martin was MIA, his older brother Glen joined the Army and requested Korea as his first tour of duty.\n\n\"Glen felt like if he could get over there, he would be able to find him,\" Ronald Martin said. \"Unfortunately, he had an accident over there and was wounded and sent home. He wasn't over there for very long.\"\n\nJames Martin's name never appeared on any prisoner of war lists and no repatriated Americans were able to provide any information concerning Martin as a prisoner of war. Due to the prolonged lack of evidence, the Army declared him deceased as of Dec. 31, 1953.\n\nDecades passed before Martin's family prepared a grave site in his honor at Mitchell cemetery in Anacoco.\n\n\"We all needed closure,\" Ronald Martin said.\n\nIn 2001, James Martin's remains, as well as the remains of seven others, were uncovered during a Joint Recovery Operation on the eastern bank of the Chosin Reservoir. He was identified 15 years later when a DNA analysis matched two of his sisters.\n\nToday, nearly 6,000 U.S. soldiers remain unaccounted for from the Korean War. Now more than 65 years after James Martin left to serve in the military, he is back with his family, buried beside his mother and father.\n\nAlong with family members, friends and hundreds of soldiers from Fort Polk, Martin's sister Ruby was in attendance for the service.\n\n\"I wish (his mother) could've seen this,\" Ronald Martin said. \"But his sister is happy that James is finally home.

It took nearly four hours to complete.\n\n\"I figured it would take them a pretty good while to measure is,\" Tucker said. \"The waiting wasn't too bad until they walked out of the room to go tally it up.

The date and site for the awards banquet has not been set yet.\n\nAlso Monday, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency declared the deer a new state record. It beat the record that Dave Wachtel set in 2000 in Sumner County; his deer grossed 256 pounds and netted 244\u215c.\n\nGrandstaff scored the antlers the day Tucker killed the deer and said he was very conservative with his measurements at that time.\n\n\"I knew there were places that it would possibly gain with this measurement because I was so conservative with it in November,\" Grandstaff said. \"I did that so that nobody would get their feelings hurt if it didn't make it.\n\n\"It did shrink a little bit here and there, but the thing that was amazing to me was that we as a group put our minds together and scored it.

Tucker said he had the deer processed and plans to eat its meat.\n\nTucker said he has not yet decided what he will do with the antlers, which could be worth more than $100,000.\n\n\"I'm just going to go with the flow,\" Tucker said. \"To be honest, I was waiting for this (score) before I put a lot of thought into it. ...\n\n\"All the phone calls and stuff had slowed down quite a bit in the last couple of weeks.

John Dorrian, a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad. \"They've been successful in defeating (the Islamic State) anywhere they've encountered them,\" he said.\n\nThe Islamic State \"considers Raqqa their capital in Syria, so we expect resistance to stiffen as forces move closer to the city,\" Dorrian said.\n\nThe Raqqa offensive, which started earlier this month, will be the SDF's largest test.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has expressed skepticism about a separate covert U.S. program to support opposition groups fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad, who has so far survived after more than five years of civil war. Trump has not commented on the Pentagon program that supports the SDF's fight against the Islamic State.\n\nThe SDF is about 30,000 strong and consists mainly of Kurds. Turkey's government opposes the force because of a push by Kurds in Turkey, Syria and Iraq to carve out an independent state, which could be enhanced by victories over the Islamic militants.\n\nPartly to allay Turkey's concern, the United States has given $30 million in weapons and other equipment only to the non-Kurdish faction of the SDF.\n\nThe Pentagon is trying to increase Arabs in the force because Raqqa is an Arab city, and a mostly Kurdish invasion would likely alienate residents.\n\nThe U.S. military had urged the group to advance on Raqqa at the same time Iraqi forces are attacking Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, to regain control from the Islamic State. The thinking is that simultaneous operations will pose a tougher challenge for the militants.\n\nThe Pentagon has several hundred advisers in Syria working with the SDF and has supported the ground campaign with airstrikes.\n\nThe SDF is stitched together from hundreds of tribal groups and lacks an organized command structure. The Pentagon said only a fraction of the 30,000 fighters are involved in the Raqqa campaign.\n\nThe Syrian Defense Forces are attempting to isolate Raqqa by cutting off supply routes into the city before entering it. \"We do expect this isolation phase to go on for a number of weeks, perhaps months even,\" Dorrian said.\n\nThe Kurds have proven to be fierce and tenacious fighters. Months after Iraq's military collapsed in the face of the Islamic State's 2014 invasion, a small group of Kurds managed to hold off a massive assault by the militants on the Syrian city Kobani, which is on the Turkish border. They dealt one of the first blows to the Islamic State, proving their fighting skills.\n\nMore recently, a force of Kurds and Arabs drove the Islamic State from the town of Manbij, another major defeat for the Islamic State. The SDF has retaken about 100 square miles of terrain since the Raqqa operation began, the U.S.-led coalition said.\n\nU.S. military officials said the Manbij operation was a model for Arab-Kurdish cooperation in defeating the Islamic State: Arab forces participated in the offensive and are responsible for holding the mostly Arab city.\n\nU.S. officials said they will pursue a similar strategy in Raqqa. \"We're going to try to recruit and train a force that's from the local area,\" said Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, commander of the task force for Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe Pentagon said U.S.-led coalition aircraft have dropped 250 munitions, including bombs and rockets, since the Raqqa operation began. That kind of support is critical to the success of the operation, said Andrew Tabler, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \"If we provide support it will hold together.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.83251237869263, "HarmVice": 12, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 691, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.65223807756, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161121210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.9073806078147597, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/13/paris-middle-east-peace-conference/96531010/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e7": [2272]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 958, "scraper_regex": 910}}, "headline": "Paris peace conference: 5 reasons meeting is likely to flop", "wordcount_as_scraped": 910, "date": "20170113160000", "story_content": "Secretary of State John Kerry will join representatives from more than 70 countries and organizations Sunday to talk about the Middle East peace process, but the meeting is unlikely to produce substantial results.\n\nHere's why:\n\nStalled peace talks\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is not going, slammed the planned conference as counterproductive Thursday.\n\n\"It's a rigged conference, rigged by the Palestinians with French auspices, to adopt additional anti-Israel stances,\" Netanyahu said in Jerusalem. \"This pushes peace backwards. It's not going to obligate us.\"\n\nIsrael insists on direct negotiations with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) led by Mahmoud Abbas, as required under the Oslo Accord signed in 1993. Palestinian Authority President Abbas refuses to talk as long as Israel continues expanding residential housing for its citizens in the West Bank, an area where Palestinians hope to establish a state.\n\nThe peace talks are \"hopelessly stalled,\" said Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. peace negotiator and adviser to Republican and Democratic administrations at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \"Like rock 'n' roll, the peace process will never die, but under these circumstances, it's not going to succeed.\"\n\nTerrorism\n\nA truck attack in Jerusalem killed four Israeli soldiers and injured 17 on Jan. 8, the latest in a series of attacks on Israelis by \"self-radicalized\" Palestinians that further hurts the prospects of finding common ground and restarting talks, said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute think tank.\n\n\"We've been seeing this type of attack on and off for more than a year now,\" al-Omari said. \"Definitely (such attacks) would harden the Israelis' view.\"\n\nTerrorists demonstrate \"the breakdown of Palestinian society,\" al-Omari said. \"It means the need for peace has become more important.\"\n\nThat's why the talks' agenda will focus on interim initiatives that could make peace more likely, he said. These include strengthening Palestinian civil society and governance, people-to-people exchanges between Israelis and Palestinians and economic incentives to move toward peace.\n\nThursday, French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who proposed the conference last year, downplayed the prospects of reaching a landmark announcement by the end of Sunday's meeting. The conference aims to ensure international support for the two-state solution outlined in the Oslo Accords, he said.\n\n\"Peace will be achieved by Israelis and Palestinians, and nobody else. Only bilateral negotiations can succeed,\" Hollande said.\n\nSettlements\n\nNetanyahu is angry with the Obama administration, especially over a United Nations Security Council resolution passed in December that condemned Israeli housing projects on land in East Jerusalem and the West Bank where Palestinians hope to establish a capital for a state.\n\nThe United States abstained from the unanimous anti-Israel vote, allowing it to pass without a U.S. veto. In a 75-minute speech justifying his decision, Kerry said Israel's \"permanent policy of settlement construction \u2026 risks making peace impossible.\"\n\nThe decision exacerbated the situation, Miller said.\n\n\"I can't imagine anything said or done now in any way, shape or form will remotely change the environment for Israelis, Palestinians or Americans in a positive way,\" he said.\n\nTiming\n\nMore pressing threats across the region have eclipsed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAmid Iran's resurgence after implementing a nuclear deal with world powers a year ago, Islamic State threats to the Sunni Arab establishment, civil wars raging in Syria and Yemen and divisions in Iraq, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict \"is very low on the priority list,\" al-Omari said.\n\nThe regional tensions, especially over Iran's role, have translated to tense relations between Obama and both Israel and traditional Arab allies, and less U.S. leverage to push through a peace deal, al-Omari said.\n\n\"It would be a bad time if you're expecting the conference to relaunch negotiations\" between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, he said. \"Because the parties are just not ready, and the region is just not ready right now.\"\n\nThe U.S. political transition to the Trump administration doesn't bode well for anything likely to emerge from Paris, Miller said.\n\n\"It's nine days to go before you'll get a new president whose view of the matter seems to be fundamentally opposite of what the previous administration wants,\" he said.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nThe president-elect has made statements and appointments that align with Israeli politicians more right wing than Netanyahu, who professes to support a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict.\n\nTrump has pledged to move the Israeli Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. That would inflame passions across the Arab world because Palestinians want a capital in Jerusalem and, like most of the world, consider the city's status unsettled. Trump's choice for U.S. ambassador to Israel, his personal lawyer David Friedman, has written that Trump \"will not attempt to impose a 'two-state solution,' or any other 'solution,' against the wishes of the democratically elected Israeli government.\"\n\nMiller questions Kerry's objectives in allowing the U.N. Security Council resolution to pass, making a speech Dec. 28 that Israel perceived as biased and attending the Paris conference, considering the incoming administration's rejection of Obama's policies.\n\n\"It makes the Obama administration look bad,\" and it could be counterproductive because Trump is the \"anti-Obama,\" Miller said. \"Anything that is done now by this administration becomes radioactive. It will either be reversed or steered away from by the new administration.\"\n\nAl-Omari held out hope that Trump might pull off another surprise.\n\n\"It's too early to tell\" how Trump, who has said Israeli-Palestinian peace would be \"the ultimate deal,\" will approach the issue as president, al-Omari said. \"He defined it as the biggest deal he wants to achieve.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.3686131238937398, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 958, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.4776764931, "HarmVirtue": 15, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113160000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.86221294363257, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/11/14/trump-liberal-college-campuses-michigan-yale-glenn-reynolds-column/93765568/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 755, "scraper_regex": 637}}, "headline": "'Tolerant' educators exile Trump voters from campus: Glenn Reynolds", "wordcount_as_scraped": 637, "date": "20161114100000", "story_content": "One of the more amusing bits of fallout from last week's election has been the safe-space response of many colleges and universities to the election of the \"wrong\" candidate. But on closer examination, this response isn't really amusing. In fact, it's downright mean.\n\nDonald Trump's substantial victory, when most progressives expected a Hillary Clinton landslide, came as a shock to many. That shock seems to have been multiplied in academe, where few people seem to know any Trump supporters \u2014 or, at least, any Trump supporters who'll admit to it.\n\nThe response to the shock has been to turn campuses into kindergarten. The University of Michigan Law School announced a \"post-election self-care\" event with \"food\" and \"play,\" including \"coloring sheets, play dough (sic), positive card-making, Legos and bubbles with your fellow law students.\" (Embarrassed by the attention, UM Law scrubbed the announcement from its website, perhaps concerned that people would wonder whether its graduates would require Legos and bubbles in the event of stressful litigation.)\n\nStanford emailed its students and faculty that psychological counseling was available for those experiencing \"uncertainty, anger, anxiety and/or fear\" following the election. So did the University of Michigan's Flint campus.\n\nMeanwhile, even the Ivy League wasn't immune, with the University of Pennsylvania (Trump's alma mater) creating a post-election safe space with puppies and coloring books:\n\nAt Cornell, The Fix reported, students held a \"cry in.\"\n\nYale had a \"group scream.\"\n\nAt Tufts, the university offered arts and crafts, while the University of Kansas reminded students that there were plenty of \"therapy dogs\" available. At other schools, exams were canceled and professors expressed their sympathy to traumatized students.\n\nIt's easy to mock this as juvenile silliness \u2014 because, well, it is juvenile silliness of the sort documented in Frank Furedi's What's Happened To The University? But that's not all it is. It's also exactly what these schools purport to abhor: an effort to marginalize and silence part of the university community.\n\nIn an email to students, University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel wrote: \"Our responsibility is to remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty \u2014 and to diversity, equity and inclusion. We are at our best when we come together to engage respectfully across our ideological differences; to support all who feel marginalized, threatened or unwelcome; and to pursue knowledge and understanding.\"\n\nBut when you treat an election in which the \"wrong\" candidate wins as a traumatic event on a par with the 9/11 attacks, calling for counseling and safe spaces, you're implicitly saying that everyone who supported that \"wrong\" candidate is, well, unsafe. Despite the talk about diversity and inclusion, this is really sending the signal that people who supported Trump \u2014 and Trump is leading the state of Michigan, so there are probably quite a few on campus \u2014 aren't really included in acceptable campus culture. It's not promoting diversity; it's enforcing uniformity. It's not promoting inclusion; it's practicing exclusion. And though it pretends to be about nurturing, it's actually about being mean to those who don't fall in the nurtured class. Schlissel wrote he wants the university to be \"a welcoming place for all members of society,\" but how welcome can students who backed Trump feel in the wake of this performance?\n\nA viral (and profane) YouTube rant by Jonathan Pie points out that this sort of fear and \"othering\" of political opponents is why Trump won, and why Democrats were shocked by his victory. Pie's right to tell people that they should engage in discussion rather than dismissal of people they disagree with, and colleges and universities should listen to him.\n\nIf, that is, it's not too triggering.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.9396551847457901, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 755, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.90340353139, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161114100000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 3.57615894039735, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/01/08/storm-pummels-california-nevada/96330820/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 563, "scraper_regex": 517}}, "headline": "Storm pummels California, Nevada", "wordcount_as_scraped": 517, "date": "20170109090000", "story_content": "A winter storm pummeling California with heavy rain and gusty winds uprooted trees, delayed flights and caused road closures and traffic chaos.\n\nThe storm could last through Thursday, with a 100 percent chance of rain at times, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nOfficials urged residents to avoid driving through standing water and to stay off rural roads, where rescues could be difficult.\n\nCrews cleared trees, rocks and debris following mudslides caused by steady rain accompanying the system that could dump 15 inches in foothill areas when its done.

Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president \u2014 and delivered his stirring \"I Have a Dream\" speech. Then, as now, the nation felt divided, but King spoke with optimism on that sweltering August day in 1963.\n\nA few months earlier, however, King was not rallying the masses on the National Mall. Instead he was locked in a \"filthy roach infested\" jail in Birmingham, Ala. But King didn't lose faith; he didn't lash out in anger. Instead, writing in the margins of a newspaper, he began his his Letter from a Birmingham Jail.\n\nThe Letter was a treatise for the civil rights movement and was perhaps the most striking articulation of the thoughts and feelings of those in the movement. Today, as the nation finds itself feeling divided once again, the Letter is a blueprint of how to peacefully fight racial inequality without losing faith in America.\n\n\"It's more dangerous to be black in America,\" said former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. \"You're substantially more likely to end up in a situation where the police don't respect you, where you could easily get killed. If you're a normal, white American,\" he concluded, \"you instinctively under-estimate the level of discrimination and the level of additional risk.\"\n\nThe atrocities of racism from antebellum through the 1960s are well documented. Since then, we have made significant progress. We can't ignore the progress, but saying the situation has improved is not the same as saying the situation is just.\n\nThe vast majority of police officers are fair-minded, but systemic racism remains in our justice system and in our police forces. For example:\n\nThe sting of racism isn't limited to the inner city or the poor. Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina shared his personal experiences on the Senate floor. \"Imagine the frustration, the irritation, the sense of a loss of dignity that accompanies each [police] stop, even here on Capitol Hill \u2026 I have felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted,\" he said. \"I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself.\n\nIn his Letter from jail, King called what Scott is describing the \"degenerating sense of 'nobodiness.'\"\n\n\"All men are created equal.\" When that notion is juxtaposed with the racial inequality in our criminal justice system, it's easy to understand the frustration many of us feel. Frustration is justified, but violence never is. Those who resort to violence, King said, have \"lost faith in America.\"\n\nSo, if the struggle for equality continues, how do we get there?\n\nSome suggest a \"national conversation\" on race, but this won't be sufficient. \"National conversations,\" President Obama said after the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the death of Trayvon Martin, \"end up being stilted and politicized, and folks are locked into the positions they already have.\"\n\nInstead, we need to move the conversation from the national level to the personal level. Intimate and personal conversations between individuals, friends and colleagues may yield more sustainable change. The goal is not to debate the experiences of African Americans, but to increase awareness and develop a level of empathy that will result in a less divided nation.\n\nWith empathy as a goal, minorities should realize many fair-minded members of the majority have a lack of awareness about how pervasive injustice is in the criminal justice system, due to lack of exposure. A genuine lack of awareness is not racism.\n\nHowever, choosing to ignore the facts is an abdication of citizenship. All Americans have a moral obligation to oppose injustice. Those who have not seen the discrimination first-hand should realize, \"just because you do not feel the pain,\" in the words of Sen. Scott, \"does not mean that it does not exist. To ignore \u2026 our struggles, does not make them disappear, it simply leaves you blind and the American family very vulnerable.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.06673622131348, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 1, "wordcount": 819, "FairnessVirtue": 9, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.59787949687, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170116180000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.88400488400488, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/05/topless-at-maryland-beach/93340864/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1121, "scraper_regex": 1063}}, "headline": "Bare-chest activist plans to show up on Md. beaches", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1063, "date": "20161105110000", "story_content": "OCEAN CITY, Md. \u2014 This coming summer, Chelsea Covington plans to hit the beach topless.\n\nShe's is not an exhibitionist or a nudist. Instead, she believes in normalizing the female body and has traveled throughout the mid-Atlantic, blogging about her interactions with people along the way.\n\nShe has taken photos at the Washington Monument, biked along trails in Philadelphia and visited beaches in New Hampshire, Assateague Island and Ocean City.\n\nThe 27-year-old from Maryland's Eastern Shore advocates for \"topfreedom,\" the belief that women have the same rights as men to not be obligated by laws cover their chests.\n\nCovington believes that this type of gender shaming can be associated with \"lifelong health concerns.\" She uses the term \"bare chested,\" because she said topless is a gendered term that wouldn't be used to describe a man.\n\n\"My mission is to normalize female (bare chests) akin to how male (bare chests) are basically completely unnoteworthy,\" Covington wrote in an interview through a series of emails.\n\nBut not everyone in a beach town that caters to families is ready for Covington's social statement.\n\n\"We really don't need that here,\" said Robert Banach, who runs the Ocean City Cool Facebook page. It has 12,000 followers. \"I'm not a religious fanatic. \u2026 It's just not a thing that I should expect to see on the boardwalk.\"\n\nIn Maryland, it is legal for both men and women to be topless, as noted in Article 46 of the Maryland Constitution, which states the law cannot give preferential treatment on the basis of sex or gender.\n\nLindsay Richard, public information officer for the Ocean City Police Department, said while the practice may be legal, often other factors, such as outcry from the public, could lead police to intervene.\n\n\"If we got calls coming in complaining about someone walking around without a shirt, we would probably have an officer ask kindly if they could cover up,\" Richard said. \"Luckily, it's not a thing we deal with a lot. But if a woman refused to cover up, I can honestly say I don't know how we would handle it.\"\n\nThe people she meets in her travels are mostly positive, Covington wrote. That's why in August, she sent a request to the Ocean City Police Department about the going topless.\n\nHer inquiry was forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General, where an ultimate opinion on the town's action could take nine months, just in time for warm weather.\n\n\"I want to make it clear that this isn't about me, or Ocean City specifically, but the State of Maryland,\" Covington said.\n\nJessica Waters, communication manager for Ocean City, said that while she understands Covington's cause, the town stands precariously between defending her rights and protecting the visitors of the family resort.\n\n\"The town understands Ms. Covington's desire to be treated fairly under the equal protection law,\" Waters said. \"But at the same time, we hope to be able to protect the rights of the thousands of families that visit our beach every year.\"\n\nOnly three states outright forbid women from being topless in public: Indiana, Tennessee and Utah.\n\nIn Delaware, the law on indecent exposure says that the exposure of breasts is a misdemeanor if the intent is to cause \"affront\" or \"alarm.\"\n\nOn Sept. 24, Jennie Lee Martin was arrested in Rehoboth Beach, Del., for indecent exposure. The 37-year-old from Chevy Chase, Md., was walking topless near the boardwalk on Wilmington Avenue when city police responded. She was also charged with resisting arrest, possession of marijuana and disorderly conduct.\n\n\"We follow state law,\" said Lt. Jaime Riddle of the Rehoboth Beach Police Department. \"There's occasionally some ordinances that are strictly local, but for this case, she was in clear violation of state law.\"\n\nRiddle said the qualification of being an \"affront\" stemmed from her being around children during the incident.\n\nDespite his objections, Banach, who runs the Ocean City Facebook group, said he condones a woman's right to breastfeed on the beach, as well as opening a designated nude-friendly segment of the Ocean City beach.\n\n\"If there were a place set up where these people were allowed and welcomed to exercise their Constitutional rights, or whatever they may be, I'd be fine with that,\" Banach said.\n\nThe Rev. Gregory Knepp of St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Ocean City said his church doesn't condemn Covington's actions. He hopes that people obey the law.\n\n\"The church's viewpoint would most likely be that this is the natural state of people,\" Knepp said. \"But if the law says a woman has to do this (cover up), for safety or health of the community, we would want people to respect that.\"\n\nCovington began her journey as a topfreedom advocate in 2014, visiting Ocean City shirtless. It was the same year Lina Esco's \"Free the Nipple,\" an independent film that spurred topless protests nationwide, was released.\n\nCovington and the Free the Nipple protests play into a colorful, and lengthy, history in the topfree movement.\n\nThe movement's roots began with the Rochester 7, a group of women from Rochester, N.Y., that were led by Ramona Santorelli and arrested after staging a topless sit-in in 1986. They were later acquitted.\n\nThe dialogue on a women's right to go bare-chested took off from there, from a topless doughnut shop in Fort Collins, Colo., to bare-chested book clubs in Brooklyn.\n\n\"I am one of a long, long line of women who have sacrificed a lot more than I have to make this issue move over decades,\" Covington said.\n\nCovington's cause, she said, also includes the act of breast-feeding. While the latter act is completely legal in public, it hasn't stopped instances of women being removed from areas for breastfeeding.\n\nIn January 2015, security officers removed Alanna Panas of Mechanicsburg, Pa., from the Casino at Ocean Downs lobby for breast-feeding her 7-week-old daughter.\n\n\"Entrenched negative prejudices about female breasts discourage breast-feeding, cement the idea that women do not get to decide when they are to be perceived as sexual or not and give rise to victim blaming, rape culture and bullying,\" Covington said.\n\nCovington said she will remain vigilant to her cause.\n\n\"Sometimes these conversations take minutes, as it did in Philadelphia and York, Maine,\" Covington said. \"Sometimes months, as it did in Pittsburgh. Sometimes years, as it has in Maryland, but I'm a redhead, I don't quit, I think authorities are beginning to realize that.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 30, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.33555924892426, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1121, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 8.454056681860001, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 30, "mft_sum": 69, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161105110000, "PurityVirtue": 3, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 6.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 6, "pct_mft_words": 6.15521855486173, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/2017/01/02/blacks-police-and-health/93078464/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Tackle problems of policing, racism as public health issue: Column", "wordcount_as_scraped": 945, "date": "20170103000000", "story_content": "Problems of police brutality \u2014 seen in the killings of young black men by law enforcement all across the country \u2014 have been widely cast as a failure of our criminal justice system. But what if officials used the mountains of data that link bad health to racism to drive solutions for reducing police-involved deaths? Wouldn't that be radical?\n\nWell, this is indeed happening in the small city of Everett, Mass. And the lessons learned there hold solutions for the rest of America and merit a hard look from policymakers in each city across the country.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nStresses in our environment affect fundamental biological processes in the body \u2014 and racism and implicit biases (at the hands of cops and communities) are among the highest stresses that people of color face.\n\nEveryday stresses like lower levels of education and income, unsafe or unhealthy housing and residential segregation can contribute to poorer health outcomes for African Americans.\n\nResidential segregation, the oldest form of segregation in America, provides the most immediately measurable health disparities based on race.\n\nStresses related to location can also be caused by police interactions in minority communities.\n\nStop-and-frisk, for example, is used overwhelmingly against Hispanics and African Americans, generally during patrols of minority neighborhoods. If the goal is to get criminals off the streets, the practice has been proven not to work. Through June of 2016, 77% of the people stopped by police in New York were innocent, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Of those stopped, 53% were black, 30% were Latino, and only 11% were white. Similar numbers were found in Chicago, where 72% of stops were of blacks, while African Americans made up just 32% of the city's population.\n\nThe stress of microaggressions (small daily actions that assume guilt based on race) such as stop-and-frisk affect not just those who experience it, but entire neighborhoods and ethnic groups.\n\nAfrican Americans have disproportionately higher levels of blood pressure and more instances of chronic disease and earlier deaths than whites. This is independent of income. Scientists call this the \"weathering effect,\" or the result of the cumulative stress associated with confronting racism on a daily basis.\n\nGood health becomes a casualty of simply living in America for people perceived as \"violent\" and \"dangerous\" \u2014 words attributed to blacks and Hispanics at a higher rate than whites. In New York, Hispanic men who were frequent victims of stop-and-frisk showed heightened levels of anxiety and trauma resembling those of patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nReligious bias at the hands of police can be equally damaging.\n\nIn California during the months following the Sept. 11 attacks, women in the Arab-American community \u2014 which was the target of greater scrutiny by police and greater discrimination and harassment by many communities at large \u2014 were more likely to have either low birth-weight or premature babies, according to a study published by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Scholars in Health Policy Research Program, which is housed at Harvard University. Researchers showed that these risks weren't present in the months before Sept. 11, and they also weren't present for other women in the state.\n\nRacism is damaging, and in many instances killing, minorities in America.\n\nWhether it manifests itself in higher rates of obesity, differential treatment in the doctor's office, day-to-day indignities that can be tracked and linked to poor health \u2014 or police killings \u2014 real solutions don't reside in our courts alone.\n\nIn Everett, together the police and the community are taking on the racism that underpins bad policing and violence. Police hold regular community engagement and outreach meetings during which residents can air grievances about police activity and discuss what they perceive as racially motivated actions by law enforcement.\n\nThe police department is also making an effort to be more transparent with data. Last year, law enforcement started publishing an annual report on use-of-force incidents involving local police, including how often officers used firearms and tasers during interactions with residents.\n\nThe goal is to make people feel safe and confident.\n\nResearch shows that higher levels of trust and cohesion within a community (including police) is associated with better health, lower overall death rates, lower rates of suicide and lower rates of depression. Lessons learned from Everett's trust-building efforts can be applied to improve health in communities across the country.\n\nIn Everett, the police force has been trained to understand that common ground and mutual respect are non-negotiable for a safe community. And they're acting on it in tangible ways.\n\nOfficers have taken crash courses in Spanish and Portuguese to help open up better lines of communication with community members who struggle with English.\n\nThe efforts haven't stopped there. The department wants to improve police relations with teens, specifically young boys of color. So, once a week, officers pull up a seat in the local high school cafeteria to sit and eat lunch with students \u2014 non-adversarial interactions that can go a long way toward reducing stress on both sides.\n\nThe department even brought in child psychologists to help officers better understand the cognitive differences between school-age children and adults, and why they may respond differently than adults when faced with a stressful or threatening situation.\n\nThe threat of discrimination, fueled by unconscious bias, is a threat to all of us in our communities.\n\nThe good news is that there is a lot that each of us can do, regardless of our racial background. We can be more kind and treat all people as they deserve to be treated. And we believe that the benefits of universal respect may lead to reduced violence against people who may be no more \"violent\" or \"dangerous\" than any of us.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.2893185615539595, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 991, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.3655298922000005, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 46, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170103000000, "FairnessVice": 6, "pct_mft_words": 4.64177598385469, "mft_mean": 4.18181818182}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/01/29/homeland-security-judges-stay-has-little-impact-travel-ban/97211720/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [7354, 8379]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 906, "scraper_regex": 1465}}, "headline": "Protests against Trump's immigration plan rolling in more than 30 cities", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1465, "date": "20170129150000", "story_content": "Protesters marched, chanted and waved signs across the nation Sunday as angry immigrant advocates pressed their demand for an end to President Trump's executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.\n\nRallies underway in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Washington, Los Angeles and other cities Sunday drew thousands, part of a groundswell of fury that erupted at airports across the nation Saturday and showed no signs of abating.\n\n\"There is such an energy and anger that I have to do something about it,\" said Jan Rudzinski, of Arden, Del., as she joined a rally in Philadelphia where signs said \"Welcome Muslims\" and \"Let them in.\"\n\nIn Washington, thousands gathered and marched outside the White House.

Other demonstrations were taking place in town squares and smaller airports from Bangor, Maine, to Bloomington, Ind., to Boise.\n\nAt San Francisco's airport, hundreds of people choked the international terminal for a second straight day, waving sings that read \"Let Them In\" and \"No Ban No Wall.\" A phalanx of lawyers lined up to offer free legal aid to refugees affected by the executive order.\n\n\"I am committed to spending my weekends protesting,\" said Liz Freese-Cabrera, a video producer who attended the Women's March in Washington, D.C.

In Chicago, thousands of demonstrators gathered at O'Hare International Airport. In New York, more than 2,000 at John F. Kennedy Airport chanted \"Let them in!\" At Los Angeles International Airport, 200 protesters, shouted, \"No Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA.\"\n\nIn Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings on Sunday afternoon met with travelers who had been held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, handing them bouquets of white roses and telling reporters, \"The tide is turning and the sun is rising \u2014 and these important visitors to our city are here. We have wished them welcome and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,\" WFAA-TV reported.\n\nFederal Judge Ann Donnelly in Brooklyn granted an emergency stay Saturday at the behest of immigration rights lawyers.

But he also suggested changes to entitlement programs that the new president has not endorsed.\n\n\"I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner, rather than later,\" Rep. Mick Mulvaney said at the opening of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Budget Committee. \"I also know that fundamental changes are necessary in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy. This must include changing our government's long-term fiscal path \u2014 which is unsustainable.\"\n\nWhile Republicans on the panel were generally supportive of Mulvaney's nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., kicked off the opposition with blunt criticism of Mulvaney's previous support for cutting Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Sanders, the former Democratic candidate for president, noted that Trump promised not to cut such safety net retirement and health insurance programs during the campaign.\n\n\"In my view the opinions and ideas of Mr. Mulvaney are way out of touch with what the American people want, and more importantly ... way, way out of touch with what President Trump campaigned on,\" Sanders said. \"It does not make sense to me a key adviser to the president having views directly in opposition to what the president campaigned on.\"\n\nFor example, Mulvaney testified that he would support means-testing Medicare benefits and raising the retirement age in order to save Medicare and Social Security for future generations.\n\n\"The only thing I know to do is to tell the president the truth,\" Mulvaney said.\n\nMulvaney clarified that entitlement reforms he proposes would only affect people still working, not those currently on Medicare or Social Security.\n\n\"This is about trying to preserve those programs,\" he said.\n\nMulvaney was also confronted with questions about his failure to pay taxes on a babysitter he employed from 2000 to 2004 after he and his wife had triplets.\n\nMulvaney said the mistake was discovered two days after Trump nominated him for the Office of Management and Budget job, and he immediately took steps to correct it. He has paid $15,583 in back taxes and will pay further penalties and interest once they are calculated.\n\n\"We made a mistake in my family ... and we took every step to fix it,\" Mulvaney testified.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the Budget Committee, introduced Mulvaney at the start of the hearing and pleaded with Democrats to allow Trump to put his team in place.\n\n\"(Mulvaney) has made it his life's work to understand what is wrong with our government and is dedicated to fixing it,\" Graham said.\n\nMulvaney ran into a Republican critic later Tuesday during a second confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, when Sen. John McCain sharply challenged Mulvaney's record on defense policy.\n\nMcCain, R-Ariz., recited Mulvaney's previous votes to cut the defense budget, withdraw American troops from Europe and Afghanistan and use a government shutdown as a bargaining chip during budget debates.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about your lack of support for our military,\" McCain said.\n\nMcCain called the 2013 shutdown a \"shameful chapter.\"\n\nMulvaney, 49, was just elected to his fourth term representing a conservative district in the Upstate region of South Carolina, along the border with North Carolina.\n\nHe is a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, a rebellious wing of the House GOP that has opposed raising the nation's debt ceiling without deep spending cuts.\n\n\"Part of fixing that problem also means taking a hard look at government waste \u2026 and then ending it. American taxpayers deserve a government that is efficient, effective, and accountable. American families earn their money honestly; they expect the government to spend it honestly. We owe them that much,\" Mulvaney said.\n\nTrump nominated Mulvaney on Dec. 17.\n\nMulvaney's pursuit of spending cuts includes domestic and military programs.\n\nIn 2013, Mulvaney proposed an amendment to reduce the Overseas Contingency Operation fund at the Pentagon by $3.5 billion. He argued that the fund, created to finance combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, was unnecessarily increased by $5 billion for to pat for non-war spending.\n\nThat same year, he proposed cutting $20.4 billion in federal spending, including from the military, to pay for Hurricane Sandy disaster aid, but the amendment failed.\n\nMulvaney's record of insisting that federal disaster aid be offset with spending cuts was brought up by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who wanted assurances that Mulvaney would not delay financial assistance while he searched for corresponding cuts.\n\n\"I do believe there is a proper federal role in dealing with natural disaster relief,\" Mulvaney said. Knowing that a delay in dispensing aid can be harmful to people during a natural disaster, Mulvaney said, \"I can only imagine that will carry a great deal of weight with the president.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.54237294197083, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 639, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.19865674287, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.5383411580594695, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/02/chinese-wills-savings-beijing/95750124/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 778, "scraper_regex": 691}}, "headline": "Chinese don't have wills \u2014 and now it's a big problem", "wordcount_as_scraped": 691, "date": "20170102170000", "story_content": "BEIJING \u2014 The world's most populous nation has the second-largest economy, one of the highest savings rates and mushrooming wealth. Yet virtually no one has a will to pass on an estate. And now it's become a huge problem.\n\nThirty years after communist China embarked on a course that allowed individuals to accumulate wealth, members of the first generation to benefit are starting to die, creating a spike in inheritance disputes that are clogging up the courts and turning families against each other.\n\nThe problem has gotten so bad that even the ruling Communist Party \u2014 previously no fan of inherited wealth \u2014 is concerned.\n\n\"When people die without a will their children scramble for their property, damaging family ties and having a negative effect on society,\" the state-run Xinhua News Agency has warned.\n\nOnly 1% of China's 220 million seniors have drawn up inheritance plans, according to the best estimates. The reason is cultural: talking about death is taboo and writing a will is akin to putting a curse on yourself.\n\nEven the rich and educated often don't write them. Consider the publicized case of Yan Jiying, a coal baron from the northern province of Shanxi. He died in 2015 at the age of 71, leaving his estranged wife, long-term mistress and six children to fight over his assets.\n\nAt one point the conflict was so bad that his company, Sanjia, stopped paying wages. Local officials tried to broker a peace but to no avail.\n\n\"China is entering a crucial period. If we don't find a way to transfer wealth responsibly it will affect social stability,\" said Hu Xingdou, an economist at the Beijing Institute of Technology.\n\nTo remedy the problem, the government is calling on local authorities around the country to establish free legal centers for those over 60. One charity doing that since 2013 is the China Will Registration Center, founded by Chen Kai, a young lawyer with a passion to protect seniors. His offices in Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Nanjing have processed 40,000 wills at no charge since it was established and is the largest provider of probate services in China.\n\nThe waiting list for appointments at his first Beijing center now stretches into September, proof that people will write a will if they can find support they trust, Chen said. \"We want to teach old people that they are the masters of their fortune, that they have the right to decide what happens to their hard-earned money, \" he said.\n\nOn a recent morning around a dozen seniors were squeezed around a communal table at the center, diligently transcribing the final copy of their will. They begin by dictating their wishes to a lawyer, who types up a draft. The clients are then evaluated by a visiting psychiatrist to establish clarity of mind, they record video testimony of their wishes in the presence of two independent witnesses, and finally copy the final document by hand.\n\nFor many, the last step is the hardest. Most are over 70 and have shaky hands or poor eyesight. Transcribing a page of formal Chinese characters mistake-free is no easy task. But Chen is adamant that they do it this way, saying he has seen too many badly written wills challenged. He wants his clients to be sure their wishes will be respected even if some family members do not like them.\n\nChinese television is highlighting the issue in shows like Third Mediation Room, China's answer to Jerry Springer, and Family Property, a drama about three brothers who fight over the family business after their father dies without a will.\n\nAt the will registration center in Beijing, many said they had come after discussing their wishes with family members. Liu Maolin, 74, said he had decided to write a will because he wanted to be sure his daughter, who cares for him, gets his apartment, not his son, a businessman who lives in Japan.\n\nHis family agreed this was a fair arrangement, but he conceded there is always a risk of a later dispute. \"I didn't want them to end up like the people on television. This way they can't argue after I am gone.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.657894730567932, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 778, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.7239452996800004, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170102170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.72750642673522, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/01/24/get-to-know-ruth-negga-loving-oscar-nominated-breakout-star/96984838/?hootPostID=8f13919e5244a37957123b70f6b99ceb": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1008, "scraper_regex": 928}}, "headline": "Get to know Ruth Negga, the Oscar-nominated breakout star of 'Loving'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 928, "date": "20170124180000", "story_content": "As revealed during Tuesday's Oscar nominations, the best actress race comes down to two familiar young stars (Emma Stone and Natalie Portman), a Hollywood icon (Meryl Streep), an internationally-beloved name (Isabelle Huppert) and one fresh face \u2014 Ruth Negga.\n\nNegga's moving role as Mildred Loving, one-half of the couple that helped to legalize interracial marriage in America, earned Loving its only Oscar nomination on Tuesday. The nomination is the latest win for Negga, who broke out on TV, before stealing our hearts in Loving and catching our eye with her impeccable awards-circuit style.\n\nGet to know one of Hollywood's freshest faces ahead of the Oscars on Feb. 26, and read the full list of Oscar nominees here.\n\nNegga was born in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to an Irish mother and an Ethiopian father. When she was four, her family moved to the U.K., and Negga was raised in Limerick, Ireland, before going to London after her father died in a car accident when she was seven. \"I had quite a scattered childhood,\" she told the Guardian. \"I was Irish in London, because I had my secondary school education there. I never really fitted anywhere.\"\n\nIn an interview with Indiewire, she worried that Hollywood's narrow-mindedness on race has resulted in her ethnicity costing her roles. \"I've gone into auditions and I think they have an assumption about me when they see my photo and then I open my mouth and they say, 'Where exactly are you from? And you were born in Ethiopia? But you're Irish, but you also kind of sound English. That's really strange,\" she said. \"They want to put you in a box in LA, that's how they tend to do it there, so if you don't fit in that box, it makes it more difficult.\"\n\nNegga's Hollywood career started heating up in 2013, when she booked a recurring part in the TV show Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Even more exciting, she was cast in Steve McQueen's Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave, as the fiery runaway slave Celeste, one of the most rebellious characters in Solomon Northup's book.\n\nBut what could've been the actress' first big Oscars moment ended up on the cutting-room floor. As screenwriter John Ridley explained to NPR, they spent several days filming scenes of Negga escaping through a crocodile-filled swamp, but the footage was eventually cut from the final film, leaving her character with just a brief appearance.\n\n\"That's an understatement!\" Negga told the Irish Times about her 12 Years disappointment. 'I got a call from (director Steve McQueen) and I knew as soon as the phone started ringing, I just knew,\" she said. \"He let me down gently.'\n\nBefore she was breaking Supreme Court boundaries in Loving, Negga was cracking skulls as the gun-toting Tulip in the ultra-bloody AMC series Preacher, which premiered last year. Her role as the titular character's ex-girlfriend proved the actress can play action anti-heroines just as well as she can inspirational historical figures.\n\nNegga praised her Preacher role to the Guardian \"I'm about to go off and play a character who was originally white and blonde and has really big boobs, and none of those things apply to me,\" she said, describing Tulip's original look in the graphic novels.\n\nShe racked up early praise with her role in Loving, starting at Cannes Film Festival in May.\n\nBased on the real-life story of Richard and Mildred Loving, Negga stars alongside Joel Edgerton as the movie follows the couple at the center of the 1967 Supreme Court case Loving vs. Virginia, the ruling that eliminated laws prohibiting interracial marriage.\n\n\"Negga, a breakout from AMC's Preacher, is an instant awards contender,\" Brian Truitt wrote in USA TODAY's three-star review. \"As Mildred, she fuels much of the film's emotion, sitting in jail pregnant, dealing with relatives divided on whether her love is worth being in quasi-exile, and needing to return to farm life for the good of her kids. Negga gives her vulnerability but also strength of heart.\"\n\nShe's a believer in the power of black women\n\n\n\n\nIn interviews surrounding Loving, Negga spoke out about how stories of inspiring black women throughout history, long neglected in Hollywood, need to be told.\n\n\"A lot of women of color's stories from [the civil rights] era have been sidelined,\" she told ScreenDaily. \"It's time for a renaissance, truly, of a celebration of their contribution. There were a lot of black women involved in the civil rights struggle, in a very active way. There are many individual stories that are fascinating. Mildred's is just one of them.\"\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, Negga spoke about how her character of Mildred gave her husband Richard strength. \"Many black women, that's what they did for many black men,\" she says. \"Often their role in society was to give them back their strength. It's interesting that in this case it's a white man. I don't think we've seen that very often before.\"\n\nDespite her high-wattage public appearances, Negga is still adjusting to the Hollywood spotlight.\n\n\"I find it a bit overwhelming sometimes,\" she told USA TODAY at the Toronto International Film Festival. \"I'm shy at public speaking, which is tough. But I love this film...and I think it's professionally and personally one of the best things that ever happened to me.\"\n\nShe's a rising Hollywood style star\n\n\n\n\nNegga's metallic Louis Vuitton gown at the Golden Globes launched her onto many best-dressed lists.\n\nIn fact, her red carpet style has been on point throughout awards season, from her ethereal Valentino gown at the Palm Springs Film Festival.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.03562331199646, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1008, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.55840859627, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.18253968253968, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/columnist/2017/01/13/baseline-numbers-grade-trumps-report-card/96155374/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1125, "scraper_regex": 608}}, "headline": "Baseline numbers to grade Trump's report card", "wordcount_as_scraped": 608, "date": "20170113130000", "story_content": "Donald Trump ran on a platform of making America great again. That goal can be interpreted in various ways, but let's focus on some key metrics that measure the economy and the nation's affluence.\n\nThe following are some of the financial yardsticks that will become the baseline measurements for grading Trump. If the new president succeeds in making America great again, or at least better, most of these indicators will show improvement four years from now.\n\nStill, Trump has his work cut out for him if he wants to improve significantly on employment. The national jobless rate in November stood at a fairly low 4.7 percent at the end of 2016, and the nation added more than 2 million net new jobs during the year. Another key metric to watch is the labor-participation rate, which tabulates the percentage of adults who are employed or looking for work. The trend here lately hasn't been favorable, indicating a lot of people have just given up. The rate of 62.7 percent in December was down three full points from when President Obama took office in January 2009.\n\n\n\nMany people are struggling, with 48 percent of Americans claiming to live paycheck to paycheck, according to a December survey by the National Endowment for Financial Education. But not all studies on this issue have reached pessimistic conclusions. For example, the Pew Research Center determined that while the middle class did shrink slightly from 2000 to 2014, it's partly because more people moved into the upper range than dropped into the lower. Pew estimated 20 percent of households in 2014 were upper, 51 percent middle and 29 percent lower. The same figures in 2000 were 17 percent upper, 55 percent middle and 28 percent lower.\n\nOne key statistic on which to judge Trump's presidency is household net worth, compiled by the Federal Reserve. The latest figure of $90,196 for the third quarter of 2016 marks the seventh yearly increase following losses during the recession. Another is national bankruptcy filings, which have declined steadily and are on pace to drop below 800,000 when full 2016 results are in.\n\nTrump succeeded in elevating trade to a major campaign issue even though the problem isn't as big as it had been. The U.S. ran annual deficits exceeding $700 billion from 2005 through 2008, but the red ink has narrowed in recent years. To be successful, Trump will need to get the overall trade gap down from around $500 billion. That's the latest full-year number, from 2015. Preliminary 2016 results are in the same ballpark. But it won't be easy: The U.S. has spent more money on imports than it generates from exports every year since 1975.\n\nThe flip side of tax cuts is heightened government financial pressure. With presumably less tax revenue coming in, the federal deficit could mushroom. Washington ran a $587 billion deficit in 2016, and the accumulated debt now stands just shy of $20 trillion. Those are two key benchmarks to use on Trump's report card.\n\nSo far, investors mostly have reacted positively to Trump's election and GOP gains in Congress, with stocks rallying after the election. If the economy and corporate profits improve under Trump, the stock market will follow (or more accurately, lead the way). Trump's pledge to cut corporate tax rates, which could repatriate a lot of cash held in foreign subsidiaries, is a favorable wildcard.\n\nHere are a couple key numbers that can be used to grade Trump's progress: Inflation (as of November) was running at a 1.7-percent annual pace, while 10-year Treasury notes, which are used to set interest rates on 30-year mortgages, ended 2016 yielding about 2.45 percent.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.6072676181793202, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1125, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.18938083251, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113130000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.42222222222222, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/11/ferguson-effect-study-72-us-cops-reluctant-make-stops/96446504/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "'Ferguson effect': 72% of U.S. cops reluctant to make stops", "wordcount_as_scraped": 744, "date": "20170111190000", "story_content": "More than three-quarters of U.S. law enforcement officers say they are reluctant to use force when necessary, and nearly as many \u2014 72% \u2014 say they or their colleagues are more reluctant to stop and question people who seem suspicious as a result of increased scrutiny of police, according to a new study published Wednesday by the Pew Research Center.\n\nThe 2014 officer-involved shooting death of a black teen in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson put the national spotlight on police use of force and officers' interactions with minorities. Since then, top-ranking law enforcement officers and policymakers have debated the impact of the so-called \"Ferguson effect\" \u2014 officers becoming less proactive in their policing out of a fear their actions will be second-guessed by their superiors and the public.\n\nThe wide-ranging, national survey \u2014 which includes feedback from 8,000 officers and sheriff's deputies \u2014 quantifies just how pervasive the issue has become in departments across the U.S. in the aftermath of a series of controversial deadly encounters between police and African-American suspects. High-profile incidents in Ferguson, Mo., Baltimore, Baton Rouge, Chicago and elsewhere have spurred public protest, and cut deep rifts between police and minorities in some communities. The survey suggests that the impact has been just as deep on the morale of rank-and-file police officers.\n\n\"Within America's police and sheriff's departments ... the ramifications of these deadly encounters have been less visible than the public protests, but no less profound,\" according to the Pew report.\n\nThree-quarters of officers say the incidents have increased tensions between police and black residents in their communities. More than eight in 10 officers said police work is harder today as a result of the high-profile incidents.\n\nThe survey \u2014 conducted between May 19 and Aug. 14 with officers at 54 departments \u2014 comes on the heels of a year when several big cities \u2014 including Chicago, Indianapolis, Memphis, and San Antonio \u2014 dealt with surges in murder rates. In the midst of last year's spike, FBI Director James Comey suggested an increase in violent crime in some cities may be a result of a less-aggressive law enforcement approach in the face of increased public scrutiny.\n\nFormer Chicago police superintendent Garry McCarthy recently tied the surge in violence in the nation's third largest city \u2014 which tallied 762 murders and more than 4,300 shooting victims in 2016 \u2014 to a decline in street stops by cops. McCarthy was fired from his post in December 2015 after the court-ordered release of a video that showed a white police officer firing 16 shots at 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.\n\nThat incident, which ignited public backlash, also spurred a Justice Department civil rights investigation of Chicago Police Department's patterns and practices. The DOJ is expected to issue its findings on its Chicago investigation in the coming days.\n\nIn an op-ed in the Chicago Sun-Times published Wednesday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said it was crucial that the city have an \"engaged, proactive police department\" as the city tries to stem the violence that has disproportionately impacted a few low-income, predominantly African-American and Latino neighborhoods.\n\n\"If the reforms we must, and will, make are seen as demonizing the police, the police will naturally become reactive,\" Emanuel wrote in anticipation of the Justice report. \"They're only human. The clarity, certainty and standards they need to do their jobs will be lost, and the result will be more violence. That is not a recipe for success in our communities. The only winners in that case are the gangbangers and drug dealers.\"\n\nMost participants completed the survey ahead of the fatal shooting of five officers in Dallas in July and the killing of three officers in Baton Rouge less than two weeks later. Both incidents occurred in the aftermath of the fatal police shootings in suburban St. Paul and Baton Rouge that drew nationwide attention. All participants surveyed came from agencies with at least 100 sworn officers.\n\nThe survey also showed that black officers' views on high-profile, deadly incidents sharply contrast with their white and Hispanic colleagues.\n\nTwenty-seven percent of white officers and 26% of Hispanic officers say highly publicized deaths of African-Americans during police encounters are indicative of a broader problem between police and African-Americans. Meanwhile, 57% of black officers saying that the incidents are evidence of a broader problem.\n\nThe survey also found 67% of officers believe the public has a positive view of police, though rank-and-file officers were less likely than supervisors or administrators to hold that view.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Chicago correspondent Aamer Madhani on Twitter: @AamerISmad", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.983012676239009, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 776, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.2993060515599995, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.12371134020619, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/12/01/dhs-panel-raises-concerns-privately-run-detention-centers/94727944/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 641, "scraper_regex": 705}}, "headline": "DHS panel raises concerns about privately-run detention centers ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 705, "date": "20161201230000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 An influential Department of Homeland Security advisory panel, wary about the controversial use of privately run immigration detention centers, recommended Thursday that reliance on the practice, while immediately necessary, should not represent a permanent solution.\n\nIn an usually contentious public session, the Homeland Security Advisory Council, rejected a core finding in a 23-page panel report, concluding that the agency would continue to depend on private contractors for the foreseeable future because of a lack of capacity in government-run facilities and the cost associated with building and managing new ones.\n\nInstead, members adopted a dissenting version of the report, suggesting that fiscal concerns and enforcement policy should not \"require our deference to the status quo.''\n\nDHS, through its Immigration and Customs Enforcement arm, holds 65% percent of its more than 400,000 immigration detainees each year in private facilities. Among the detainees are those awaiting deportation, suspects in criminal investigations and immigrants pursuing legal status in the U.S.\n\nThe panel's findings are not binding on DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, who ordered the review in August, just weeks after the Justice Department cited security and efficiency concerns when it announced it was ending its use of privately run prisons, which became necessary when prison populations surged by nearly 800% between 1980 and 2013.\n\nJustice's use peaked three years ago, when nearly 30,000 of the 220,000 inmates in custody were being held in private facilities. With inmate numbers now declining, due to changes in federal sentencing policies largely directed at non-violent drug offenders, officials project that less than 14,200 inmates would be held in contract prisons next spring.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Sally Yates said in an August memo that private facilities 'simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs and resources.''\n\n\"They do not safe substantially on costs, and as noted in a recent report by (Justice's) inspector general they do not maintain the same level of safety and security.''\n\nJohnson declined to comment on the advisory panel's action following Thursday's session, and it is not clear whether the panel's findings will have any lasting influence with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has variously promised an aggressive deportation program to go along with the construction of wall along the vast southwest border.\n\nThe advisory panel's initial conclusion, citing agency's inevitable reliance on private contractors, was met with strong opposition by immigration advocates They expressed deep concerns about the facilities' capacity to house detainees safely and provide necessary medical care.\n\nJoanne Lin, the ACLU's legislative counsel on immigration, said the panel's initial draft report suggested federal detention system that would be \"wholly outsourced'' to private prisons.\n\n\"Our assessment is that (government-run) facilities are superior in condition, oversight and control,'' Lin said, claiming that government detention centers also had better records on thwarting incidents of sexual assault and in-custody deaths.\n\nElizabeth Holtzman, a Democratic former New York congresswoman and member of the DHS panel, said she was concerns by the report's suggestion that there were no other options beyond a continuing dependence on private prisons.\n\n\"Are they're alternatives to detention? What would they look like? I'm very concerned about the conclusion...that there are is no alternative,'' Holtzman said.\n\nThere was near-unanimous support, however, for the report's recommendation for a schedule of more extensive inspections and oversight of detention centers.\n\n\"Congress should provide to ICE the additional monetary and personnel resources to needed to provide for a more robust, effective and coordinated inspection regime,'' the report recommended.\n\nJonathan Burns, a spokesman for CoreCivic, a major private detention contractor formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America, said the company has for 30 years provided \"innovative, dependable solutions.''\n\n\"We are one tool available to the agency to help achieve its mission in a cost-effective way,'' Burns said. \"As always, we stand ready to support the needs of our government partner, while providing a safe, humane and appropriate environment for those entrusted to our care.''\n\nPablo Paez, spokesman for private detention firm GEO Group, said the \"facts support the continued use of privately-contracted facilities.''\n\n\"The dissents are completely unfounded and ignore GEO's long history of providing culturally responsive, safe, and humane environments that meet the non-penal needs of those individuals entrusted to the care of ICE,\" Paez said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.53164553642273, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 641, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.11753239991, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161201230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.99219968798752, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/26/congress-consider-up-15-billion-border-wall-gop-leaders-say/97078502/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00f1": [1632], "\u00e9": [2331]}}, "headline": "Congress will consider up to $15 billion for border wall, GOP leaders say", "wordcount_as_scraped": 587, "date": "20170126170000", "story_content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Congressional leaders said Thursday they expect the Trump administration to send them a request soon for $12 billion to $15 billion to fund construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIt was the first time that Republican leaders have provided a price tag for the wall.\n\n\"We intend to address the wall issue ourselves,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters on the second day of a three-day retreat for congressional Republicans.\n\nCongress will take up President Trump's expected request before the end of September, when fiscal 2017 ends, said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. It will be in the form of an emergency budget request, meaning that it will not be part of the regular spending bill to fund the government from April 28 through September. Current funding for federal agencies is set to expire on April 28 under a temporary spending bill passed last week.\n\nIf funding for the wall was part of the broader spending bill that Congress must pass in April, it could conceivably lead to a government shutdown since Democrats will oppose it.\n\nRyan said the funding request will allow Congress to finally carry out the Secure Fence Act, which lawmakers passed in 2006 to construct a series of fences and walls along the Southwest border.\n\n\"Now we're actually going to deploy this fence,\" Ryan said.\n\nTrump had campaigned on a promise to build the border wall and make Mexico pay for it. He is now saying that Mexico will reimburse U.S. taxpayers for the cost, despite assertions by Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto that his country will not pick up the tab.\n\nDemocrats said a wall can't take the place of comprehensive immigration reform that includes border security, visa changes and a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants already living in the country. They also were upset that an emergency request to fund the wall can be done without GOP leaders having to make offsetting budget cuts to pay for it.\n\n\"As far as the wall is concerned, I suspect that a lot of Trump supporters would be just as happy with a big statue of a middle finger pointed south, because both that and a wall are about equally effective as national security strategies,\" said Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, D-Ill.\n\nMcConnell and Ryan insisted that they are working on coordination with Trump, despite the fact that the new president's controversial announcements this week on torture, voter fraud and immigration have taken attention away from their focus on health care, tax reform and reducing government regulation.\n\nRyan said he and McConnell have been working with the White House on those legislative priorities \"so, yes, we are on the same page.\"\n\nThe two leaders said they expect to enact a tax overhaul and repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act \u2014 better known as Obamacare \u2014 before Congress adjourns for its annual August recess.\n\n\"I intend to stick to the plan and make as much progress as we can,\" McConnell said.\n\nRyan said congressional leaders have adopted a legislative agenda for the first 200 days of the Trump administration rather than the first 100 days because the Senate will be busy confirming about 1,200 of the president's nominees for government jobs.\n\n\"It's a very bold and aggressive agenda,\" Ryan said. \"At the end of the day, if we get these things done, we really believe we're going to get the country back on the right track and turn things around for the people who elected us.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.5015015602111799, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 589, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.35312347374, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5653650254668903, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/20/democrats-inauguration-boycott/96853496/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Some Dems take day away from Capitol to protest Trump presidency", "wordcount_as_scraped": 958, "date": "20170121000000", "story_content": "Noon Friday was one of those historical moments everyone will remember: where they were the moment President Donald J.

Dwight Evans took to Twitter to publish photos of himself with health-care workers at the Philadelphia Free Library's Inauguration Day Civic Engagement Fair. Evans also sent out footage of inspiring inauguration speeches from John Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and others, and in a barrage of tweets reminded his followers that Trump's promised repeal of Obamacare could lead to unemployment and worse.\n\n\"Repealing the Affordable Care Act means 137,000 lost jobs ... and people dying,'' said Evans, forwarding a message from his state's Democratic caucus.\n\nThe decision to skip the inauguration did not come easy for many lawmakers who said they sought to weigh their respect for the Constitution and Office of the President with their aversion to Donald Trump. He received 304 electoral votes last month to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's 227 even though Clinton had 65.8 million total votes to Trump's 63 million.\n\nNeither received a majority of the popular vote.\n\nRepublicans and several leading Democrats said the inaugural snub is ill advised, a disrespectful jab at the office and a constitutional ceremony that should rise above politics.\n\nAwesome visit today at @CHSgreyhounds Bright students, dedicated educators #educate#inspire#empower#Americasfuturepic.twitter.com/72tGs7ytFR\u2014 Lacy Clay MO1st (@LacyClayMO1) January 20, 2017\n\n\"I don't think it's good for democracy,\" former Obama adviser David Axelrod said.\n\nMany other Democratic members of Congress, especially some in key leadership posts and others in red or purplish electoral districts where support for the new president is high, rejected a boycott.\n\nFor some who did not attend, the decision was made easier because of Trump's attack on Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. The civil-rights icon has said that the real-estate magnate's ethical conflicts, coupled with Russian efforts to hack the election for the Republicans, make Trump an \"illegitimate\" president.\n\nSome lawmakers who remained undecided until recent days joined other boycotters in using their free Inauguration Day as a time to simply stay at home and ponder the future of the nation.\n\nAfter many years attending the pageantry at the Capitol, they had few plans.\n\nOnly last week, Rep.

My personal feeling is this is the peaceful transition of power,\" Booker said after speaking at a Martin Luther King Day breakfast organized by the National Action Network, a group led by the Rev. Al Sharpton that hosted a protest march against Trump on Saturday.\n\n \n\n \"Barack Obama will be up there, handing off the reins of our country and I feel ... it's important for us to be up there. This doesn't mean I agree with Donald Trump,\" Booker said.\n\n \n\n Several Democratic members of Congress have said they would stay away from the ceremony, including Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, who joined Booker for a widely publicized appearance last week criticizing Trump's pick for attorney general. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democrat who was the first African American woman elected to Congress from New Jersey, said Saturday she would hold an interfaith prayer vigil in her hometown of Trenton on Inauguration Day.\n\n \n\n \"Our nation is founded on democracy and inclusion that unfortunately our president-elect refuses to represent,\" Watson Coleman said.\n\n \n\n But Booker, a Democrat from Newark who was the state's first African American U.S. senator, pointed to an inaugural tradition stretching back to George Washington's departure from office.\n\n \n\n \"I respect our institutions, and so I'll be there just like the president will be there and most of my Senate colleagues,\" Booker said. \"But as soon as that hand goes down and the ceremonies are over, it's time to get to work on advancing our nation's ideals and if Donald Trump wants to repeal our health care, undermine our Justice Department's the critical work they've been doing for the last eight years, if he wants to go after Muslim Americans, immigrant Americans, all these things, I'm going to be fighting to try to stop, to try to make sure we don't see the kind of change or retrenchment or reversals that I worry about.\"\n\n \n\nBooker received national attention when he urged his colleagues last week at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing not to confirm a fellow senator, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, as Trump's attorney general. The testimony broke a Senate tradition in which senators do not appear in committee to oppose colleagues' appointments to cabinet posts, and fueled speculation Booker is positioning himself for a possible presidential run in 2020.\n\n \n\n Sharpton alluded to that at one point during the three-hour breakfast, noting that Barack Obama previously spoke at the breakfast and went on to become president.\n\n \n\n \"I'm not predicting anything,\" Sharpton said. \"But when I was growing up, we used sing in church, 'I'm so glad trouble doesn't last always' \u2014 well, neither will Trump last always.\"\n\n In his speech to the group, Booker urged the audience to remain focused on the need to fight racial inequities, especially in the way drug crimes are prosecuted.\n\n \n\n \"We live in a nation with two different justice systems, where a bunch of guys smoking pot at Stanford get a very different treatment from the law as people smoking pot in inner cities. We know in America right now there's no difference of drug use between blacks and whites. But if you're black in America, you will be arrested for it, about 3.7 times more likely to be arrested,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Since taking the Senate oath of office in 2013, Booker has been a leading advocate for criminal justice reform, including a reduction in criminal sentences for drug crimes. He often argues that the war on drugs helps fuel crime and economic despair in urban areas because of disproportionate enforcement and laws that make people with criminal records ineligible for many safety net programs, including food and housing assistance.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.5850341320037797, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 645, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.3153786416, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170116200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.961240310077519, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/nation-now/2017/01/09/chicago-beating-hate-crimes-free-speech-christian-schneider-column/96316924/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Chicago beating doesn't need to be a hate crime: Christian Schneider", "wordcount_as_scraped": 677, "date": "20170109180000", "story_content": "The nation convulsed in horror last week at a video of black suspects in Chicago torturing and beating a disabled white man, all while broadcasting their barbarity on Facebook Live. One alleged assailant is heard to be yelling \"f--- Donald Trump!\" and \"f--- white people!\" While the 18-year old special needs man is bound, one of the suspects takes a knife and cuts off a piece of his scalp.\n\nThe assailants, two male and two female, were later charged with felony aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. But they were also charged with violating Illinois' hate crime law, which provides for enhanced penalties. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said there was \"never a question whether or not this incident qualified to be investigated as a hate crime.\"\n\nWhile no sentient human would defend the heinous actions on that torture video, the hate crime charge is inappropriate in this \u2014 or in almost any \u2014 case.\n\nHate crime laws, which now inhabit the regulatory books of virtually every state, transform law enforcement officials into thought police, monitoring the reasons and motivations for criminal actions. If the Chicago Four, for instance, had hated Trump, loathed white people or had disdain for the disabled, they would not be prosecuted for having those thoughts independently. Because those thoughts may have been expressed in this brutal video doesn't remove the constitutional protection they are afforded for having them.\n\nWhat hate crime laws actually do is set up a complicated hierarchy for whose safety is valued most. Members of certain groups are afforded more legal protections based on statute. Last session, one Wisconsin lawmaker even introduced a bill to automatically classify harming police officers as a hate crime. In the ongoing debate about whose lives matter most, hate crime laws seek to rank them via state law.\n\nFurther, enforcement of hate crime laws is spotty and uneven. According to the FBI, Michigan reported more than three times as many hate crimes (309) as Illinois reported in 2015 (90). Does anyone believe that the people of Michigan are three times as hateful as those of Illinois? Of course, each state has its own laws, but what constitutes hate is clearly a subjective and capricious determination.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nIn 1993, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of hate crime laws, affirming an enhanced sentence for a black Wisconsin man who beat a white 14-year-old boy into a four-day coma. The man had been watching the movie Mississippi Burning with some friends. Soon they set out to find a white person upon whom to exact revenge for the violence against African Americans portrayed in the film. Without the hate crime enhancer, the man would have served a maximum of two years in prison; the hate designation could have added five more years to his sentence.\n\nYet there's a difference between whether hate crime laws are constitutional and whether they are wise. All Americans deserve equal protection under the law; an unspeakable crime such as beating and scalping a disabled person should be prosecuted vigorously regardless of the perpetrators' motivations or statements in committing the crime. And if the penalty for the acts isn't stiff enough in the absence of hate crime enhancers, enact stiffer sentences for breaking the law.\n\nThe Chicago assault would not have been any less reprehensible had the attackers forgotten to express disdain for white people, Donald Trump or the disabled. As Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., said on the Senate floor in 1993, protesting a hate crime provision in a federal crime bill, we should punish conduct but \"our speech should be free.\"\n\nChristian Schneider is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and a columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, where this piece was first published.

In previous interviews, Piro has said Saddam did not know his true identity \u2014 the Iraqi leader called him \"Mr. George\" \u2014 and that he posed as a high-level envoy who answered directly to then-President George W. Bush.\n\nNow the 49-year-old Piro, a native of Beirut, Lebanon, fluent in Arabic and Assyrian, is in charge of the FBI investigation into the shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport that left five people dead and six wounded. Federal prosecutors have charged Esteban Santiago, 26, with airport violence and firearms offenses that could bring the death penalty if he is convicted.\n\nIn announcing the charges filed Saturday, Piro said his thoughts are with the victims and their families.\n\n\"I want to ensure these families that law enforcement is working tirelessly in order to ensure justice is served,\" he said.\n\nPiro, an FBI agent since 1999, moved with his family from Lebanon to California's San Joaquin Valley as a teenager. After high school he enlisted in the Air Force, then became a police officer for a decade in Ceres, California, followed by a job as an investigator in the local prosecutor's office.\n\nOnce he joined the FBI in Phoenix, Piro was one of only a handful of Arabic-speaking agents \u2014 a group that suddenly was in great demand after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks and the subsequent U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2003, Piro was promoted to the FBI's Counterterrorism Division at headquarters in Washington, leading to his work as Saddam's interrogator.\n\nEventually, Piro said Saddam confirmed that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction prior to the U.S. invasion but might seek them in future to deter Iran and other threats. Saddam also denied any links to al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden, Piro has said.\n\nSaddam also liked to brag about how he escaped U.S. airstrikes and capture, according to Piro.\n\n\"What he wanted to really illustrate is . . . how he was able to outsmart us,\" Piro told \"60 Minutes.\" ''He got rid of his normal vehicles. He got rid of the protective detail that he traveled with, really just to change his signature.\"\n\nSaddam was later tried and executed by hanging in December 2006.\n\nSantiago, the airport shooting suspect, also served in Iraq in 2010 with the Puerto Rico National Guard as part of an engineering battalion, guard officials said. Santiago later served in the Army Reserves and Alaska National Guard.\n\nAfter Iraq, Piro moved on to top FBI counterterrorism jobs in Washington, including a White House position involving high-value detainee interrogation that works with various intelligence agencies.\n\nSince taking the top Miami FBI job, Piro has overseen work in more domestic areas such as health care fraud, identity theft and tax fraud, Ponzi schemes and mortgage fraud \u2014 all areas where South Florida is among the nation's leaders. Bank robberies, violent street gangs, public corruption and smuggling of humans and drugs round out much of the work for the Miami office's roughly 1,000 agents and employees.\n\nSince Friday's shooting, Piro has been careful to say no evidence linking Santiago to terrorism has been found but such connections have also not been ruled out.\n\n\"It's way too early in the investigation. We're looking over all of his social media, things like that. It's giving us a picture of the individual, but it's way too early for us to rule out anything,\" Piro said Saturday. \"We're pursuing all angles on what prompted him to carry out this horrific attack.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 22, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.9817943572998, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 708, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.19517274087, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170109000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.7909604519774005, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/01/26/president-trump-abc-interview-david-muir/97069516/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00f1": [1262, 1299]}}, "headline": "In first TV interview, Donald Trump repeats unverified voter fraud, inaugural claims", "wordcount_as_scraped": 942, "date": "20170126070000", "story_content": "Less than a week into his presidency, President Trump has taken steps to weaken the Affordable Care Act, advance unverified claims about voter fraud and inaccurate media coverage and authorize the construction of a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nTrump sat down with ABC News' David Muir for the first television interview of his presidency, looking back at how the new administration has rocked the capital and what's ahead for the nation.\n\nThe wall: Who's picking up the tab?\n\n\"Mexico will pay for the wall.\"\n\nTrump tweeted it. He said it during interviews during his presidential campaign. He rallied his supporters around that promise. And while Trump plans to move forward with the wall construction, it seems less likely that Mexico will cover the cost, at least at the outset.\n\n\"All it is, is we'll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico,\" he said. \"I'm just telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form. What I'm doing is good for the United States. It's also going to be good for Mexico. We want to have a very stable, very solid Mexico.\"\n\nBut he hasn't convinced Mexico President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. In an address Wednesday, Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he regrets Trump's decision to build the wall, but that Mexico won't pay for it.\n\nMuir asked whether undocumented immigrants should be worried, especially those who grew up in the U.S.\n\nTrump didn't say what would happen to the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, but he said, \"they shouldn't be very worried. They are here illegally. They shouldn't be very worried. I do have a big heart. We are going to take care of everybody. Where you have great people that are here that have done a great job, they should be far less worried.\"\n\nVoter fraud?\n\nMuir asked about a meeting with lawmakers in which Trump repeated the unverified claim that 3 to 5 million illegal ballots cost him the popular vote.\n\nAt no point did Trump offer evidence or explain how he reached those figures. At one point, he denied making the assertion, but Muir reminded him that he tweeted about it.\n\nStill, Trump insisted during the interview that signs of voter fraud \u2014 people registered in multiple states or dead people still registered \u2014 could have played a role. But the 3 to 5 million illegal votes in question? \"We're going to find out,\" Trump told Muir, \"but it could very well be that.\"\n\nFrom the CIA Memorial Wall to crowd sizes\n\nThe dispute between Trump and fact-checkers over the inaugural crowd size continues. Days after his speech at the CIA Memorial Wall, where he brought up his inaugural crowd size, his appearance on magazine covers and his opposition to the media, Trump insisted the negative coverage wasn't a reflection of the backlash his speech garnered from officials like former CIA Director John Brennan. Instead, it was another affront by the dishonest media, he suggested.\n\n\n\n\"That speech is a home run,\" Trump said. \"That speech, if you look at FOX ... they said it was one of the great speeches. They showed people applauding and screaming, and they were all CIA ... I got a standing ovation.\"\n\nTrump insists that his inaugural speech had the largest audience in the history of inaugural speeches. According to Factcheck.org, it didn't.\n\nTorture and terror\n\nReports surfaced that the White House could allow the CIA to reopen secret overseas prisons and reinstate harsh interrogation procedures for \"high-value alien terrorists,\" according to a draft of an executive order under consideration.\n\nTrump did not go into specifics with regard to whether he would bring back specific interrogation methods, but he said he feels waterboarding works.\n\n\"I have spoken as recently as 24 hours ago with people at the highest level of intelligence, and I asked them the question 'Does it work? Does torture work?' And the answer was 'Yes, absolutely,'\" Trump said.\n\nStill, he added, he would defer to Defense Secretary James Mattis and CIA Director Mike Pompeo.\n\nWith regard to suspending immigration from certain countries, Trump again said there would be \"extreme vetting\" of nations on his ban list. The conversation then led to Iraqi oil, where Trump suggests violating international law.\n\n\"We should have kept the oil when we got out,\" Trump said about the U.S. involvement in Iraq. \"Had we taken the oil, we wouldn't have had ISIS.\"\n\nTrump made this claim several times throughout the presidential campaign and as far back as 2007, according to Politifact. As Muir pointed out, pillaging is illegal. Taking the oil would violate the Annex to the Hague Convention of 1907 on the Laws and Customs of War and the 1949 Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Times of War (H/T Politifact).\n\nTrump incorrectly claimed it wouldn't break international law, despite Muir reminding him of otherwise:\n\nThe words Muir was trying to \"get to\" was Trump's assertion that the U.S. could have another chance to take the oil. Trump didn't answer one way or another: \"When it comes to the military, you don't want to discuss things,\" he said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act \n\nTrump dismissed questions about whether his suggested replacement for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, would be considered universal healthcare.\n\nWhen Muir asked whether any of the millions of Obamacare recipients would lose insurance access, Trump said, \"I think no one.\"\n\nHe predicted that \"millions of people will be happy. Right now you have millions and millions and millions of people who will be unhappy.\"\n\nTrump offered no response on how he plans to change that, though.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.0841121673583998, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 923, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.76279267542, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126070000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.7085590465872205, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/01/30/ivanka-trump-dressed-down-her-5k-designer-dress-during-airport-chaos/97235626/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e1": [2612]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 534, "scraper_regex": 637}}, "headline": "Ivanka Trump criticized for wearing $5K designer dress during airport chaos", "wordcount_as_scraped": 637, "date": "20170130160000", "story_content": "Timing is everything in politics, as French Queen Marie Antoinette learned two centuries ago, and Ivanka Trump was reminded of over the weekend.\n\n\"Let them eat cake!\" mocked the tweets and Instagram comments on Trump's accounts, after she posted pictures of herself and husband Jared Kushner dressed to the nines \u2014 she in a $5,000 silvery gown by Carolina Herrera \u2014 just as chaos and protests erupted at international airports over President Trump's just-signed order barring refugees and travelers from some Muslim countries.\n\nThere was nothing unusual in Ivanka's posts: She has regularly used her Instagram and Twitter accounts to show herself and her family in carefully staged, usually innocuous settings.

He paused when he came across a young woman standing alone in the hallway, making a phone call about her grandfather's faltering health.\n\n\"Are you aware of the caregiver support center?\" Epstein asked when she got off the phone. Just around the corner from the sterile waiting room, he told her, there's a refuge with hot coffee, soft chairs and pleasant company.\n\nEpstein, an energetic former financial broker who still plays tennis twice a week, knows the hallways well: His wife was a patient at the hospital, Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, before she died. Now he's one of 30 volunteers who make their rounds there, recruiting stressed-out families to visit a small suite set aside for their comfort and emotional support.\n\nMontefiore's caregiver support center, staffed by a social worker and an administrative aide, is one of 11 that have popped up over the last decade in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Michigan and Iowa, based on a model created in 2006 at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York.\n\nHospitals are showing a greater interest in family caregivers in part because of new penalties for hospital readmissions, said Jill Gottlieb of Northern Westchester Hospital, who helps other hospitals set up their own support centers. Gottlieb said when family caregivers get the emotional and logistical support they need, they are better poised to help patients successfully transition home.\n\n\"The family caregiver often is thrust into this world unexpectedly,\" she said. \"They're ill-prepared.\"\n\nInside hospitals -- where they spend long hours awaiting surgeries or last-ditch efforts to keep loved ones alive -- family caregivers feel invisible and are \"most often ignored,\" said Susan Reinhard, director of AARP, which has been leading a state legislative campaign to require hospitals to incorporate caregivers into a patient's care plan.\n\n\"We were in a very sterile environment,\" Kaplan recalled. \"Nobody talked to us.\"\n\nKaplan returned to the hospital in 2005, during a \"cascading course of unstoppable events\" at the end of her husband's life. Rushed to the critical care unit after his cancer spread to his liver, he died at age 50.\n\n\"I was falling apart,\" she said. Kaplan said she needed emotional support, but again, \"nobody approached us \u2014 not a social worker, not a chaplain.\"\n\nThat experience inspired Kaplan to help Montefiore create the support center in 2011, complete with a soothing waterfall, pictures of cherry blossoms, and private rooms with reclining chairs. Last month, she won an award from the Schwartz Center for Compassionate Healthcare for her work at the center, which has seen an estimated 10,000 families so far.\n\nOn a recent morning, she burst in the door with a bag of groceries \u2014 oranges, coffee, dark chocolate, red velvet cake and tissues \u2014 to offer to patients and staff who would pass through the center for the next six hours.\n\nTissues are essential, she said: Families visiting loved ones in the hospital are \"always emotionally fatigued, always anxious, always feeling alone and overwhelmed. Once they sit down, the tears start flowing and the tissues come out.\"\n\nAbout half of the people who come in the door are dealing with end-of-life situations, she said.\n\nThe scene inside the center can be tense: Earlier this year, Kaplan said, a woman came to the center in hysterics, gasping for air. The woman's husband, who was in his 30s, had been rushed to the hospital in cardiac arrest.\n\nKaplan said she held the woman's head to stop her from banging it against the concrete. The woman's family urged staff to medicate her. Instead Kaplan called in a palliative care doctor, Say Salomon, who calmed her down and told her her reaction was perfectly normal. Kaplan later held the woman's hand while a surgeon told her her husband had died.\n\nSalomon, who stopped into the center recently, said he often brings families to the center for difficult conversations. In one recent case there, he said, he helped a family call the patient's son in jail. The son, who had just learned his father was dying, had to decide whether to use his travel privileges to visit his father in the hospital, or to attend the funeral.\n\nAt other hospitals, conversations like these take place in sterile conference rooms, or at the patient's bedside, Salomon said \u2014 \"There's no dedicated space for something like that.\"\n\nThere's no dedicated space for hospital weddings, either, but that didn't stop Kaplan from hosting one. She grew so close to one couple \u2014 a cancer patient and her partner of 14 years \u2014 that they insisted on getting married right inside the caregiver support center, with Kaplan as maid of honor. Kaplan decorated the space with flowers and walked the bride down the \"aisle.\" As she does with many families, Kaplan stayed in touch with the husband, even after he lost his wife one month ago, at age 59.\n\nA recent visit to the hospital featured no grand ceremonies, but lots of small acts of compassion.\n\nAlexa White, the 24-year-old woman whom Epstein had stopped in the hallway, arrived a few hours later with her grandmother and cousin in tow. She said her grandfather broke his hip and was suffering from internal bleeding. As they awaited more updates, White, a nursing school student, caught up on homework and her 80-year-old grandmother took a nap.\n\nRamon Santiago III, who sells life insurance, was visiting the hospital by himself, waiting for his father to emerge from two major surgeries \u2014 a heart and kidney transplant. He stopped in to use the center's public computers, and stayed to chat with Kaplan over coffee and pastries. He also met volunteer Elvin Olivera, a liver transplant survivor who announced himself as living proof that organ transplants work.\n\nIn addition to former patients like Olivera, volunteers include retirees from a variety of careers \u2014 police sergeant, elementary school teacher, CT scan technician, and labor union president. They went through 10 weeks of training, on top of the unofficial training of caring for their own loved ones.\n\nThe center, established through a grant from the United Hospital Fund, does not charge for any of its services. It has allowed the Montefiore to \"take a more holistic view\" of patients in the context of their family, instead of simply focusing on the surgery or procedure of the day, said Dr. Peter Semczuk, the hospital's executive director.\n\nSome of the family caregivers the center has helped also work inside the hospital. Laura Tocci, the hospital's director of audiology, said she came to see Kaplan after her wife was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a year and a half ago.\n\n\"I walked through the door and I just started crying,\" she said. Tocci kept coming back every day for a year.\n\nTocci said talking to Kaplan helps her find the strength to \"walk back out and do what has to get done\" \u2014 caring not only for her patients, but her wife and her 15-year-old son.\n\n\"It's a hard job,\" she said. \"This makes it easier.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.221893489360809, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1204, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.37671748459, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170112010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.7408637873754196, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2016/10/31/bill-cosby-returns-court-seeking-dismissal-sex-assault-charges/93059506/?hootPostID=942ca964bb7868dacdba0c318d697c02": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Bill Cosby arrives for hearings seeking dismissal of sex-assault charges", "wordcount_as_scraped": 947, "date": "20161101150000", "story_content": "Bill Cosby returns to court Tuesday in Pennsylvania for what is expected to be a two-day hearing in the accused comedian's latest attempt to get sexual assault charges against him dismissed.\n\nMontgomery County Judge Steven O'Neill will hear arguments in the Philadelphia suburb of Norristown on three key issues in the case, including whether a damaging deposition by Cosby \u2014 in which he acknowledges he obtained drugs to give to women he sought for sex \u2014 can be used at trial.\n\nMore controversially, O'Neill also will decide whether the prosecution can bring up Cosby's alleged \"prior bad acts\" \u2013 the accounts of 13 other women who accuse Cosby of similar assaults.\n\nCosby, who is set to go to trial in June 2017, faces three counts of aggravated indecent sexual assault stemming from a 2004 encounter with Temple University employee Andrea Constand, who looked to Cosby as a mentor. Constand, a 43-year-old Canadian now living in Toronto, says Cosby drugged her and assaulted her at his Montgomery County home, an account similar to that of five dozen other women who have come forward to accuse Cosby since the fall of 2014.\n\nThe prosecution aims to show that Cosby, 79, exhibited a pattern of sexual assault dating back to the 1960s and in multiple states. Cosby has not been charged in any of these other accusations, due to statutes of limitation in other states, but prosecutors say the 13 other accusers' testimony should be admitted in his trial.\n\n\"During the course of this case, the Commonwealth investigated nearly 50 women allegedly victimized by defendant,\" the court papers say. \"What became clear was that defendant has engaged, over the course of his lifetime, in a pattern of serial sexual abuse.\"\n\nNot so, say Cosby's defense team, adding that prosecutors are relying on \"tainted, unreliable memories of women, now in their senior years.\" Cosby will seek competency hearings on any accusers allowed to testify, arguing that a defense memory expert who reviewed their statements found the accusers' memories have been marred by time, media coverage of the case and their friendship with one another.\n\nCosby's lead defense attorney, Brian McMonagle, has made it clear he will fight against the admission of these accounts, saying at Cosby's last hearing in September that much of the actor's reputation has been irreparably damaged through these charges. Cosby's civil rights work has also been dismissed, McMonagle said outside the courthouse in September.\n\nCosby and his lawyers have tried before to get the charges dismissed on various grounds, and have failed each time. At his most recent hearing, they tried to argue that Constand should have been compelled to testify in person at the hearing, so that Cosby could confront his accuser in person. But the judge ruled against him, citing Pennsylvania law that allows use of hearsay testimony, such as a police report of Constand's accusations, at a preliminary hearing.\n\nIn a recent court filing seeking dismissal of the charges, Cosby's lawyers said it's become clear that this case is not about whether Cosby sexually assaulted Constand. Cosby has denied all of the accusations against him, and his lawyers reiterate in court documents that he did not assault Constand.\n\n\"In fact, the Commonwealth has chosen to turn this case into a platform for Mr. Cosby's other accusers to air their even staler, long-ago, time-barred claims that were never reported to authorities,\" court papers say. \"The Commonwealth's choices about how to prosecute this case, combined with its lengthy delay in bringing charges, impose an impossible burden on Mr. Cosby.\"\n\nThe defense lawyers say Cosby is blind and will have trouble defending himself in court given that he can't see his accusers.\n\nDistrict Attorney Kevin Steele said he's prepared to go to trial as soon as the court will hear the case, which he reopened after promising to pursue Cosby during his election campaign last November.\n\nThe prosecution is seeking to use Cosby's own words in a damaging deposition he gave for a civil lawsuit filed by Constand in 2005, which was later settled. (The deposition was included in \"new evidence\" Steele cited in charging Cosby, after a previous district attorney had declined to file charges in 2005. Cosby argues the deposition should be tossed because it was sealed and then wrongly released by a judge.)\n\nSteele also wants to use the transcript of a secretly recorded phone call between Cosby and his accuser's mother, Gianna Constand, in 2005.\n\nStuart Slotnick, a New York criminal defense attorney who's been following the Cosby case, predicts Cosby will not succeed in getting the case dismissed before trial; the only question \u2014 and the point of the hearing \u2013 is what evidence will be admitted.\n\nSlotnick believes the judge will allow at least parts of the deposition to be admitted, and it's a \"toss-up\" whether the secret phone call will be allowed (Constand's mother was in Canada, where secretly recording a phone call is not illegal).\n\nBut Slotnick says allowing other accusers to testify is much more risky for judges, who generally don't like to be overturned on appeal for making mistakes at trial, such as allowing in testimony that is more prejudicial than probative.\n\n\"The prosecution parading 13 other complainants to say Bill Cosby sexually assaulted Andrea Constand because he did it to 13 other women \u2014 that should be precluded. End of sentence,\" Slotnick says. \"It is so outrageously prejudicial to Cosby to have to try 14 trials all in one, especially in one where the prosecution will have a significant problem of meeting the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt because (Constand) has tremendous credibility problems. It's a not-guilty verdict waiting to happen.\n\nThe hearing is expected to span Tuesday and Wednesday.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.73430395126343, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 992, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.06105164523, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161101150000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997, "FairnessVice": 2, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 2.82258064516129, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/07/stop-trying-undermine-trump-legitimacy-russia-hack-christian-schneider-column/96260032/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 864, "scraper_regex": 788}}, "headline": "Stop trying to undermine Trump legitimacy: Christian Schneider", "wordcount_as_scraped": 788, "date": "20170107110000", "story_content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan stood stone-faced behind House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as she addressed the new 115th Congress. Before handing him the gavel, she tossed a Molotov cocktail at the GOP \u2014 saying our democracy cannot be \"subverted by the dark operations of a foreign regime.\"\n\nPelosi was referring, of course, to reports that Russia had attempted to influence the American election in favor of Donald Trump, who it is believed is friendlier to the Russian regime. Just days before U.S. intelligence agencies released findings to that effect, she was surfing a wave of stories like one in the New York Times that bore the headline \"Obama Strikes Back at Russia for Election Hacking.\"\n\nThis tapestry of vagueness has led to confusion about what exactly happened during the election. According to a recent YouGov poll, 52% of Democrats think the Russians \"definitely\" or \"probably\" tampered with vote tallies to help Trump's election.\n\nYet there is no evidence of any kind that this type of \"hacking\" took place. There is, however, strong evidence that Russian agents gained access to emails from the Democratic National Committee and other notable Democrats and released them prior to Election Day. According to reports, many of these emails were compromised because of Democrats that fell victim to phony emails urging them to divulge their passwords.\n\nThere's scant evidence that even publication of these emails made any difference. Intelligence officials have said that is not possible to measure. Perhaps the most impactful national secret now out in the open is Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's recipe for creamy risotto.\n\nBut Pelosi is not interested in nuance. Her job is to feed the wing of her party that seeks to delegitimize the Trump presidency, even if she has to take the solemn first day of the new Congress to spin her conspiracy fantasies. And she is not alone \u2014 outgoing Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid opined that Russian interference in the election was \"as big as\" the attacks of 9/11 or Watergate.\n\nIn doing so, Pelosi is trafficking in a modern warhead of ideological weaponry: the idea that a new president of the opposite party is not only wrong, but that he or she actually holds the presidency illegitimately.\n\nCertainly, Americans have always argued that ideologically opposite politicians are wrong, or perhaps unqualified. (And on these counts, I have argued Trump is both.) But the idea that the presidency was gained through trickery or subterfuge keeps gaining momentum.\n\nIt began most notably following the 2000 election, when Democrats convinced themselves George W. Bush actually lost Florida, and thus the election. Even though an extensive review of the vote by multiple news groups (including USA TODAY) in 2001 confirmed that Bush would have won almost any recount, liberals still hang on to this fantasy even in 2017.\n\nOf course, this is by no means a partisan phenomenon. Throughout Barack Obama's presidency, fringe Republicans pushed the idea that Obama was not born in the United States, and thus was ineligible to hold office. Ironically, one of the primary reasons Trump is unqualified for the presidency is that he gave life to the moronic \"birther\" movement.\n\nIf the reporting on this so far is correct, what the Russians did was essentially add more information to the public knowledge base about the candidates. They simply put information out and let the public digest it, which is far less nefarious than the actual hacking of vote machines. In fact, on Election Day, there were few voters that didn't know Russia was trying to influence the election through the release of the emails. (I wrote about it in June.)\n\nThat doesn't, of course, mean that Trump's policies toward Russia shouldn't be under heavy scrutiny. If the president were anyone other than Donald Trump, a misguided desire to have friendlier relations with an adversarial power like Russia would be a foreign policy at least worth debating. But the contents of Trump's brain are often between him and his Twitter feed, and crediting him with a coherent view of the world appears to be presumptuous.\n\nWhat's indisputable is that Trump is the properly elected president. At the very most, it appears the Russians disseminated information that was moderately embarrassing for a presidential candidate. But if this is now the new standard, the biggest danger for the American electoral system is Trump's own mouth.\n\nChristian Schneider is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and a columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

But spokesman Dontaye Carter confirmed to USA TODAY that Bobbi Kristina's death is still under investigation \u2014 a status that could continue indefinitely in Georgia even in the absence of evidence of a crime.\n\nThere is no limitation on how long a Georgia prosecutor can investigate a death, says Randall Kessler, a former civil attorney for Gordon during the period last year he was trying to visit Bobbi Kristina in the hospital when she was in a coma.\n\n\"But every day that no charges are brought is better for anyone being investigated,\" Kessler told USA TODAY.\n\nGordon has two criminal attorneys, Jose Baez and Joe Habachy, who have said all along the allegations against Gordon are baseless.

She died without regaining consciousness to explain what had happened.\n\nAn autopsy later found she died from drowning with a combination of drugs and alcohol in her system, but the Fulton County medical examiner could not determine whether she died as the result of an accident, suicide or foul play.\n\nBrown, still mourning, remains convinced Gordon, who was living with Bobbi Kristina and was present when she was found, had something to do with her death.\n\n\"We have said all along that Nick Gordon was responsible for the death of Bobbi Kristina Brown and the harm of losing a child is immeasurable,\" Christopher Brown said.\n\n\"I do know that Mr. Gordon will be unable to slander my daughter's name in the future or obtain any benefits from the use of Krissy's name,\" Bobby Brown added in his statement.\n\nThe court-appointed conservator for Bobbi Kristina's estate filed a civil wrongful-death lawsuit against Gordon in August 2015, accusing him of giving her a \"toxic cocktail,\" and of beating her and stealing from her while she was in a coma. Bobby Brown later joined that lawsuit.\n\nGordon, who moved to Florida, never showed up in court to defend himself in the lawsuit because he couldn't afford to pay for civil lawyers. As a result, he lost the case by default.\n\nIn September, Gordon was deemed \"legally responsible\" for Bobbi Kristina's death after he failed to appear in court. On Thursday, the judge assessed the damages Gordon must pay at $36 million, including $15 million for the value of Bobbi Kristina's life and nearly $14 million for her pain and suffering from assault.\n\n\"Apparently, Mr. Gordon did not appear in court and the court ruled, understandably, without hearing from Mr. Gordon,\" Kessler says. \"It is unknown what the result may have been had Mr. Gordon appeared and participated.\"\n\nChristopher Brown says some of the $36 million judgment will flow to Bobbi Kristina's estate but most of it will go to Bobby Brown, and not to Bobbi Kristina's Houston relatives. Will Bobby split it with others in his family, such as Bobbi Kristina's half-siblings? Christopher Brown did not respond to that question.\n\nThe question may be academic since Gordon almost certainly lacks $36 million. Still, David Ware, the Atlanta attorney who represented Bobbi Kristina's estate in the lawsuit, vowed to collect anyway.\n\n\"We intend to pursue, with all vigor, the full collection of the judgment,\" Ware said in a statement Thursday after the judge ruled. \"(Gordon) will not escape justice nor ever profit from his misdeeds.

ALBANS, Vt. \u2014 A Georgia man has denied charges in connection with a shooting police say was fueled by a dispute over a truck blocking the man's driveway.\n\nEthan Gratton, 26, appeared Tuesday afternoon in Vermont Superior Court in St. Albans. He pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder. His lawyer says he was defending himself.\n\nGratton is accused of killing David Hill, 57, and critically injuring Mark Brito, 27, both of Fairfax. Judge Gregory Rainville ordered Gratton held without bail.\n\nHill and Brito were logging on Georgia Mountain Road, and their vehicle was blocking the driveway of the home Gratton shared with his parents while the loggers loaded a skid machine onto a truck trailer, Franklin County State's Attorney Jim Hughes said. Gratton told the men to get out of the driveway, and a fight ensued, the prosecutor told reporters outside the courthouse.\n\nThe evidence indicates that after the fight, Gratton retrieved a handgun from his home, walked back outside and shot the two men. Gratton admitted to several people that he shot Brito and Hill, and he could be heard in the background of a 911 call his mother made to the police.\n\n\"Right now, we're at a little bit of a disadvantage because the only person who can tell us what happened in the fight is Mr. Gratton, the defendant,\" Hughes said outside the courthouse Tuesday. He said he is unsure if the suspect knew the two victims.\n\nLawyer Steve Dunham, who represented Gratton during the hearing, said the man acted in self-defense.\n\n\"The evidence of self-defense is great,\" Dunham said. \"Mr. Gratton was on his own property, and as you can see, one of the two individuals punched him in the eye, broke his nose and knocked out his front tooth.\"\n\nHughes disputed the self-defense argument, saying, \"The time for self-defense was done.\"\n\nDunham said Gratton has strong family ties to the area, has no criminal record, graduated from BFA-St. Albans and Castleton University, and had a job at The Cupboard Deli and Bakery in Jeffersonville.\n\nAttempts to reach the owners of the Cupboard were unsuccessful Tuesday. An employee who answered the phone declined to speak about Gratton.\n\n911 call \n\nGratton's mother, Pamela Gratton called emergency services shortly before 2 p.m. Monday and said there were two bodies in the road, according to an affidavit written by Vermont State Police Detective Sgt. Jacob Zorn.\n\nWhile Pamela Gratton was on the phone, she could be heard saying to someone in the background, \"Did Ethan get into a fight with them?\" Zorn wrote that a male voice responded, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Pamela responds by saying, 'Did you shoot them?'\" the affidavit states. \"The male responds by saying, 'I (expletive) shot them.'\"\n\nPamela Gratton then asked why.\n\n\"Cause I told him not to back up in the driveway.

He is accused of killing the black parishioners during a Wednesday night Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in June 2015.\n\nGergel said the motion from Roof's defense counsel required his \"immediate attention.\" The document was filed under seal and the hearing was to involve only Roof and his attorneys.

Those who moved on completed a questionnaire.\n\nBased on questionnaire answers, the court, with input from defense attorneys and prosecutors, determined many of the candidates were not qualified and excused them.\n\nIn a death penalty case, prospective jurors who say they would not be able to recommend a sentence of execution are not considered for a final panel, as are those who seem overzealous regarding the death penalty.\n\nJury qualification will continue until 70 members of the pool who are deemed qualified by the court, a process that at its earliest could end early next week, but could take much longer depending on the pace of the proceeding.\n\nAfter the selection of the 70 prospective jurists, defense attorneys and prosecutors can begin striking members of the panel.

The look of the uniforms has been well-received by many of American's workers. But, in December, the carrier's flight attendant union called for a total recall of the uniforms, claiming the outfits have sickened as many as 2,000 attendants with symptoms that include rashes, itching, headaches and eye irritation.\n\nClothing manufacturer Twin Hill pushed back against those complaints in a Monday letter to the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the union that represents American's cabin crew.\n\nFULL TEXT: Twin Hill's letter to American Airlines' attendants\n\nIn its letter to APFA leaders, Twin Hill asserts testing shows its uniforms to be safe, though the company added it is nonetheless eager to find a solution. Twin Hill also challenged the APFA over what it says are unsubstantiated claims.\n\n\"Many of your public statements, in particular, have been both inaccurate and damaging to Twin Hill 's reputation,\" Daryl Stilley \u2013 Twin Hill's senior vice president and marketing director \u2013 said in the letter addressed to APFA national president Bob Ross and APFA national health chair Gabby Harty.\n\n\"We were deeply concerned when claims made by the APFA started to surface about your members having reactions to the American Airlines uniforms provided by Twin Hill, and we immediately leveraged every resource at our disposal to investigate those claims.\"\n\nStilley said that testing has \"returned results concluding that the collection is safe.\"\n\nBut Stilley also challenged the APFA to follow through on a pledge to visit the company's Houston warehouse along with American officials for joint chemical testing of the uniforms.\n\n\"We don 't expect you to take our word for it -- we encourage you to see for yourself, and to eliminate any doubts you still may have about the authenticity and accuracy of the extensive testing that has been done and the safety of our garments,\" Stilley added.\n\n\"We supported the request of APFA representatives to visit our Houston distribution center and select uniforms directly for joint chemical testing with American Airlines,\" Stilley continued. \"We scheduled that visit - on three different occasions over the last eight weeks - and each time, the APFA has unilaterally cancelled the visit at the last moment. Considering the nature of your claims about your members' reactions, we are at a loss to understand what could take priority over this meeting.\"\n\nDespite the broad roll-out of the uniforms to several work groups in November, the attendants' union is the only one that's so far made such wide-reaching claims that the uniforms are causing health problems.\n\nAbout 350 attendants have filed formal complaints with the airline, spokeswoman LaKesha Brown told Today in the Sky.\n\nIn the meantime, Twin Hill said in its letter that it has been working with American to come up with more alternatives for attendants reporting problems.\n\n\"American Airlines has already made our non-wool line available to individuals experiencing any sensitivity to the uniforms, and we are now working on designing entirely new 100% cotton garments as a third alternative,\" Stilley wrote in the letter to the APFA. \"We are committed to ensuring that every single AA employee has a uniform that is both safe and comfortable.\"\n\nThe letter closed with a renewed invitation for the APFA to participate in joint testing at the manufacturer's facility.\n\n\"Given the health reactions you assert your members are facing, we anticipate that you will not delay scheduling your visit to our distribution center any longer,\" Silley said. \"Please contact your American Airlines liaison, who will work with me to schedule that meeting.

Roof's defense team had sought to have the defendant declared incompetent to represent himself after he told the court last week that he planned to offer no witnesses or evidence in the shooting deaths of nine African American parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nThe sentencing phase of the case, originally expected to begin Tuesday, has been pushed to Wednesday at Roof's request, after he told the judge he had devoted much of the last several days to the competency hearing. A jury of 10 women and two men will hear opening statements.\n\nRoof has said in court that he plans to deliver an opening.\n\nIn opting to serve as his own lawyer, the 22-year-old has blocked his defense team from offering psychologists and psychiatrists in the sentencing phase of the trial.\n\nA jury on Dec. 15 found Roof guilty of 33 federal counts, and the next day, a U.S. marshal delivered a court notice to the defendant, one that informed him a hearing would be held in coming days regarding any mental health evidence he might present in his defense.\n\nRoof told the marshal to wait, and immediately penned a response on notebook paper.\n\n\"I, Dylann Roof, withdraw the notice to present mental health mitigation through expert testimony,\" he wrote, reversing a strategy laid out months earlier by his defense attorneys. \"I will not be calling mental health experts or presenting mental health evidence.\"\n\nAs sentencing resumes, prosecutors anticipate calling nearly 40 people to the stand, most of them family members of the victims, though the lead FBI agent in the case is expected to again testify as prosecutors seek a death sentence.\n\nBased on Roof's plans to proceed without a defense, his standby counselors asked the court to review if he is competent, the second time they have done so since proceedings began. In November, Gergel found Roof was fit to self-represent following two days of in-person and written testimony from eight people.\n\nBallenger was appointed by the court to evaluate Roof ahead of both competency hearings, and over the New Year's holiday weekend saw Roof for about five hours, Gergel said.\n\nDr. Rachel Loftin, a clinical psychologist based at Chicago's Rush University Medical Center, and an Orthodox priest also appeared at the hearing.\n\nWhat those witnesses told the court is unknown, but transcripts of the competency hearings will be released after jurors reach a sentencing verdict, Gergel said, adding he anticipates that will occur in about 10 days.\n\nAny mental defect that Roof might be suffering from has not been disclosed, but Dr. Xavier Amador, a psychologist who has offered more than 70 evaluations in capital cases, sees evidence of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder in Roof's two-hour video recorded confession with FBI agents.\n\n\"I've worked with thousands of people with schizophrenia over the last 30-plus years and he looks like somebody who has schizophrenia. If you look at the entire interrogation, he has significant flat affect with moments of inappropriate laughter that have nothing to do with the prosecution's theory that he's a white supremacist killer,\" said Amador, who has evaluated \"Unabomber\" Theodore Kaczynski and Zacarias Moussaoui, sentenced to life as part of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nOn the video, recorded the day after the June 17, 2015, shootings, an investigator asked Roof, \"What kind of gun did you use?\"\n\n\"A Glock .45,\" Roof responded with laughter, a moment that came less than eight minutes after agents sat down with him.\n\nLater, Roof seemed baffled when an investigator told him he killed nine people. He had guessed that five were dead.\n\n\"If this was the laughter of a depraved racist, why wasn't he laughing and gleeful when he found out he killed more people than he knew?\" said Amador, who has no connection to the Roof case. \"Instead, he was perplexed, confused, incredulous and there was no expression of happiness.\"\n\nJust what evidence defense attorneys presented in the Monday hearing is unknown. Gergel closed the hearing to the public over the objections of the media and a prosecutor, who asked it remain open so that family members of victims might attend.\n\nGergel said opening the hearing would force him to sequester jurors who might inadvertently hear media reports on new information in the high-profile case, a course he was reluctant to take.\n\nThe pervasiveness of social media and the \"saturation in coverage\" as well as Roof's right to a fair trial were factors in his decision to close the hearing, he said, adding, \"I can't walk down the street without hearing people talk about this case.\"\n\nThe competency hearing would in part address Roof's planned strategy, one that he said extends beyond not offering witnesses or evidence, Gergel said, in offering another reason for it to be closed, though he did not elaborate.\n\nThe judge has repeatedly advised Roof to rehire his attorneys, calling his decision to dismiss them \"strategically unwise\" and once told the defendant to seek the advice of his grandfather, who is an attorney.\n\nGergel has given Roof until Tuesday, before proceedings begin to change his mind.\n\nShould he continue to serve as his own attorney, Roof is forbidden from approaching the jury, the witness stand, or the bench under a court order issued Monday by Gergel. Both he and the prosecutor will address the jury during opening and closing statements from a lectern, which was not used when Roof was represented by counsel in the trial's guilt phase.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.36974811553955, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 532, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.6160353486, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170102170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.00751879699248, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/09/school-choice-betsy-devos-confirmation-class-glenn-reynolds-column/96319432/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 811, "scraper_regex": 742}}, "headline": "Of class and classes: Glenn Reynolds", "wordcount_as_scraped": 742, "date": "20170109180000", "story_content": "The long knives have come out for Education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos. But her critics aren't attacking her because they think she'll do a bad job. They're attacking her because they're afraid she'll do a good job. But I think that her success will be important, if you care about addressing inequality in America.\n\nWhat DeVos's critics hate most is that she's an advocate of school choice. DeVos supports charter schools, education vouchers, and other ways of letting parents control where their kids go to school. The people who hate this idea are mostly, in one way or another, people who instead want a captive market of taxpayer-funded pupils. But what's good for politicians, administrators, and teachers' unions isn't necessarily good for kids.\n\nThe other day I noticed a series of tweets from photographer Chris Arnade, who specializes in portraits of the parts of America that aren't doing well. Arnade stressed that the big source of inequality in America is cultural, rather than economic. The values that are extolled by what he calls the \"front row kids\" who run things (Joel Kotkin calls them the \"gentry liberals\") are those associated with fancy education, and it's hard to get ahead without knowing them.\n\nEven as we've had more talk about economic inequality, the lines of social inequality have hardened:\n\nYou're not going to acquire that polish in the public schools if you're poor. Public schools are sold as promoting equality, but in practice they're more likely to reinforce inequality. People with money move to \"good\" neighborhoods, and they do it \"for the schools.\" People without money generally live in \"bad\" neighborhoods, where the schools aren't very good and probably won't teach their kids what they need to know to get ahead.\n\nOf course, as Lucinda Rosenfeld wrote recently in The New York Times, \"the most privileged segment of society does not use the public schools at all.\" Rich parents send their kids to private school.\n\nPoor parents can't afford to do that, but school choice, of the sort that DeVos has championed, would give them the chance to do so. The problem is, giving parents choice in where to send their kids is very bad for the existing public schools, because given a choice, so many parents choose to send their kids elsewhere.\n\nEven without vouchers, many public school systems are in trouble because parents see that they are inferior, and scrimp, save, and maneuver to get their kids into better places. Since the kids whose parents care that much about their education tend to be the better students, their departure makes the public schools noticeably worse, leading to further departures. As I noted in my book, The New School, in a number of cities this has led to school closings and teacher layoffs, as failing public schools can't retain enough students to stay in business. As black Atlanta educator Nikita Bush says, \"people are starting to realize that public education in America was designed for the masses of poor, and its intent has been to trap poor people into being workers and servants. If you don't want that for your children, then you look for something else.\"\n\nIf leaving lousy public schools gets easier, still more people will leave and these problems will grow. This won't be bad for the kids, who'll be going to better schools. It'll be bad for the teachers, administrators and union officials who depend on the existing schools to maintain their jobs.\n\nRemember this when you hear people arguing that school choice is a tool for destroying public schools. The truth is that when public schools are good, most parents won't bother with vouchers or charters. But when public schools are bad \u2014 and they often are \u2014 school choice will allow people to escape, and do better.\n\nAs Arnade notes, education has become our big class signifier. If you want to help poor kids get ahead, then you need to support school choice. If you want to keep poor and minority kids in their place, then by all means trap them in failing public schools.\n\nWe know what DeVos wants to do. And we know what her critics want, too. So when these issues come up during her confirmation, keep that in mind.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.34042549133301, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 811, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 13, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.69945271807, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170109180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.2059186189889, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/01/24/oscar-diversity-more-than-black-or-white-latinos-asians-excluded/96951730/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1779, "scraper_regex": 1646}}, "headline": "Oscar nominations 2017: Diversity is not a simple black-or-white issue", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1646, "date": "20170124220000", "story_content": "The list of acting nominees includes a black actor and an Asian actor \u2014 Mahershala Ali (Moonlight), who is African American, and Dev Patel (Lion), who is British of Indian descent \u2014 nominated in the best supporting actor category.

Cherry (@MatthewACherry) January 24, 2017\n\nAlex Nogales, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, said the film studios fell short \u2014 again. \"Without question, the multidimensional portrayals of our community are what audiences want,\" he said. \"Latinos are outraged: Our actors are not getting the opportunities to work in front of camera, and with few exceptions, in back of the camera as well.\"\n\nSonny Skyhawk, founder of American Indians in Film and Television, congratulated \"our African American brothers and sisters\" but said he believes the nominations excluded \"other people of color, especially when it comes to American Indians.\"\n\nDaniel Mayeda, chair of the Asian Pacific American Media Coalition, applauded the increased number of black actors and actresses in the nominations list, but said Patel's status as the only Asian actor nominated reflects \"the continued lack of real opportunities for Asians in Hollywood.\"\n\n\"Certainly it's better than it has been, especially for African Americans, but Latinos were shut out again this year, and it's a huge problem,\" Mayeda said. He said it's \"obvious\" that studio heads need more help in diversifying the industry, and should work more closely with multi-ethnic coalitions such as his to achieve that.\n\n\"We believe that the box-office results of Hidden Figures and Moana, which were huge successes, show that a general audience will respond to an authentic story, and that's what we're asking for \u2014 authentic stories that put us at the center,\" he added.\n\nSarah Kate Ellis, CEO and president of GLAAD, which monitors LGBT representation in the media, posted congratulations on Twitter and on the GLAAD blog for Moonlight, a coming-of-age story about a gay black youth. She also hailed Negga's nomination in Loving, the story behind a 1967 Supreme Court decision upholding the right to interracial marriage that many believe paved the way for the court's ruling upholding the right to same-sex marriage.\n\n\"This should be a signal to filmmakers to tell more diverse stories,\" Ellis wrote. \"The global impact of inclusive and diverse stories is massive and changes hearts and minds. The Oscar noms are uplifting in these darker political times.\"\n\nJeetendr Sehdev, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies the challenges in improving diversity in the film industry, last year charged Hollywood had been \"whitewashed.\" This year represents an improvement \u2014.but not for all, he says.\n\n\"The Academy seems to have missed the point of #OscarsSoWhite,\" Sehdev said. \"This movement isn't about pacifying black film critics because you were named and shamed by them for two years, but genuinely embracing diversity today as a necessary way of life that doesn't just include nominating black people but also including Hispanic, Asian Americans and LGBT people, who remain horrifyingly under-represented at the moment.\"\n\nThe lack of diversity in Hollywood movies and Oscar nominations (and, thus, winners) is anything but new; it's been the rule since the invention of film cameras that most of the people working in front or behind those cameras have been white males.\n\nBut 2016 was the second year in a row when dissatisfaction with that status quo boiled over andfound a near instantaneous means of expression in the #OscarsSoWhite campaign .\n\nIn the 2014 nominations (announced in 2015) and the 2015 nominations (announced in 2016), all of the 20 major acting nominations, plus the best-picture category, went to a white person or to a white-themed movie. Black, Latino, Asian and Native American actors and stories were shut out, as were female directors and producers.\n\nAfter the #OscarsSoWhite campaign took off at the end of 2015 and gained momentum at the 2016 Oscars ceremony in February, the academy responded. In July, the academy announced it had invited a record 683 filmmakers, actors and craftsmen to join the organization \u2014 the largest, most diverse class ever inducted by the academy: 46% were women and 41% were minorities.\n\nWhile the move was historic, it was unclear whether the shift would be sizable enough to avoid an #OscarsSoWhite three-peat.\n\nMoreover, an examination in February by USA TODAY of the slate of nearly 200 movies officially announced for release in 2016 by 14 studios, suggested the Oscars in 2017 would be just as pale and male as in 2016.\n\nThe analysis did not assess the Oscar viability of those movies. But it showed a discernible lack of minority and female faces in major roles and among the directors of the films being released between January and December 2016 \u2014 and a striking number of movies in which there were going to be only white faces.\n\nTuesday's nominations puts that issue away, at least for now. But it's not over.\n\nLatinos, who can be black, white or Asian, make up the largest minority group in America, Sehdev says, but remain the least obvious in Hollywood. \"Even with the academy's supposedly radical membership changes, the 7000-member group remains shockingly white and male,\" he said. \"There is simply no excuse at this point.\"\n\nThe critically acclaimed musical, La La Land, tied with All About Eve and Titanic for the most nominations ever \u2014 14 total \u2014 but its relegation of actors of color to insignificant roles will \"only exacerbate the feeling that Hollywood's core values remain whitewashed,\" Sehdev says.\n\nHollywood activists pushing for more women to get a chance to operate at the top level of the industry were disappointed that no women were nominated for best director.\n\n\"It's wonderful that we see much more diversity but at the same time I'm still dismayed that movies that women make can't get into the Oscar conversations,\" says Melissa Silverstein, founder of WomenandHollywood.com, who said some women were nominated in less high-profile categories such as film shorts. \"We're still in a place where the default is always male and they don't see the potential opportunity to hire women.\"\n\nMartha Lauzen, head of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, says the nominations are a product of the mix of individuals in the industry in any given year, and the biases of the academy's voting membership. And her studies show that women still lag behind men in front and behind the camera, she says.\n\nShe thinks the overall number of black characters did not increase significantly in 2016. \"I would also note that focusing on just a few high-profile actors can be incredibly misleading,\" Lauzen says. \"They can lead us to draw conclusions about the representation of certain groups that are inaccurate. Also, inclusion is not just a black-and-white issue, where are the Latino and Latina actors?\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.27478754520416, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1779, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.09577689354, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124220000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 1.34907251264755, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/02/republican-congress-puts-priority-targeting-regulations-trump/96003180/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 753, "scraper_regex": 793}}, "headline": "Republican Congress puts priority on targeting regulations", "wordcount_as_scraped": 793, "date": "20170102170000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Bills to block or roll back federal regulations, initially conceived by Republicans as a check on President Obama's power, are high on the agenda when the House returns to Washington this week and the changes could become reality shortly after the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe 115th Congress begins Tuesday with a Republican majority in the House and Senate preparing for the arrival of a Republican president for the first time in eight years.\n\nThe House is expected to take up two bills \u2014 the Midnight Rules Act and the REINS Act (which stands for Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny) \u2014 that passed on largely party-line votes in the 114th, 113th and 112th congressional sessions, but died in the Senate. The REINS Act would require that before any new major regulation could take effect, the House and Senate would have to pass a resolution of approval. The Midnight Rules Act would let Congress invalidate rules in bulk that passed in the final year of a presidential term.\n\nThe House is also expected to consider a nonbinding resolution disapproving the Dec. 23 United Nations Security Council vote that called on Israel to stop building settlements in the West Bank. The United States abstained in that vote, allowing the measure to pass.\n\nRegulations are adopted by the executive branch to implement laws passed by Congress and signed by the president. Congress already has the power to repeal laws by passing a new bill and getting the president to sign it. And under the 1996 Congressional Review Act, Congress can pass a resolution of disapproval to block a rule if it acts within 60 days of notification from an agency.\n\nThe new legislation would further expand congressional power by preventing an administration from implementing rules without another vote. Under the REINS act, a proposed regulation would be deemed rejected if Congress was in session for 70 days and took no action. The bill allows for a major rule to take effect for a single 90-day period if the president determined it was necessary because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency.\n\n\"Our federal agencies are out of control, and Congress is partly to blame for that,\" the bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, said in a release last week. \"We've ceded our legislative responsibility to agencies that were never intended to make laws, and the result has been redundant, counterproductive rules that have massive impacts on our economy.\"\n\nWhen the House considered the Midnight Rules Act in November, the White House said it would recommend that Obama veto it. Trump, however, has taken a page from the conservative playbook and blamed government regulations for holding down economic growth and job creation. He has pledged to eliminate two regulations for every new one adopted during his presidency.\n\nThe REINS Act and Midnight Rules Act are aimed at major rules. An April 2015 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office said are those that meet one of these conditions: an economic impact of more than $100 million; cause significant price increases for consumers, industries, geographic regions or state or local governments; or have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity or foreign competition.\n\nThe CBO said that over the past five years, 82 major rules have been adopted each year, on average. Blocking such regulations in the future would have \"a significant effect on direct spending,\" but CBO could not predict whether the effect would be positive or negative because it could not say whether Congress would block regulations to increase or decrease spending.\n\nBefore the House voted on the final REINS Act in 2015, Democrats unsuccessfully tried to include amendments that would exempt rules that affected veterans health care, nuclear reactor safety, transportation of hazardous materials, and the safety of products used or consumed by children under the age of 2. Each attempt was rejected in a largely party-line vote.\n\nCritics say the changes would endanger the public and worsen gridlock in government.\n\n\"Regulations are public protections that are intended to safeguard regular citizens from dealing with unclean air and water, financial crises and unsafe products,\" said Lisa Gilbert, director of the CongressWatch program at Public Citizen. \"They are intended to protect us, and to do away with them wholesale is an extremely problematic approach.\"\n\nGilbert said that while no one would argue every regulation is perfect, the changes Congress seeks to make would effectively stymie future rulemaking and allow Congress to erase actions the Obama administration took since the summer. She said she hoped there would be enough votes in the Senate to sustain a filibuster on the Midnight Rules bill, but on the REINS Act, \"it's possible there could be a path\" for it to pass.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.24852061271667, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 753, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.2305171175200003, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170102170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.12483399734396, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/03/israel-palestinians-two-state-solution-editorials-debates/95970066/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 744, "scraper_regex": 673}}, "headline": "Keep Mideast peace option alive: Our view", "wordcount_as_scraped": 673, "date": "20170104000000", "story_content": "The dream of Israelis and Palestinians living peacefully side by side in neighboring homelands is on life support, the chances of it surviving as a viable Middle East peace option slowly ebbing away. But that doesn't mean it can't be saved.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry attempted some very public CPR in his impassioned address last week, explaining why the Obama administration refused on Dec. 23 to veto a United Nations resolution condemning the proliferation of Israeli settlements that place the two-state solution in jeopardy.\n\nHard-liners derided the speech as little more than a eulogy for the hope of an independent Palestine, a peace doctrine dating to the birth of Israel seven decades ago. But if Kerry's goal was to breathe life into that option until Palestinians have a leadership brave enough to embrace both independence and compromise, there are ways to preserve the two-state solution. It could be left to President-elect Donald Trump, the self-styled artist of the deal who called an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement the \"ultimate deal,\" to make it happen.\n\nKerry's speech was an excellent primer for why the only other option \u2014 a one-state solution \u2014 is a recipe for endless misery. Israel would carve what it wants from the West Bank and perpetually occupy or isolate the remainder and Gaza. Palestinians in the annexed territory would either have to be granted full Israeli citizenship \u2014 adding their embittered population to a growing Arab-Israeli society that would someday outnumber and outvote their Jewish counterparts \u2014 or be relegated second-class citizens.\n\n\"If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic \u2014 it cannot be both \u2014 and it won't ever really be at peace,\" Kerry rightly warned about a solution that is growing ever more popular within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative Cabinet.\n\nThere have been more than 2,000 Palestinian terror attacks on Israelis in the past year \u2014 stabbings, shootings and bombings. While the regime of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas says it opposes such violence, Abbas and his party leaders still abide public squares, schools and streets being named in honor of the attackers. Fatah websites glorify them. Hamas fires intermittent volleys of rockets out of Gaza. These actions block a pathway to peace.\n\nBut the solution at the end of that pathway \u2014 should the Palestinians ever actually embrace a final two-state agreement \u2014 is being destroyed by ever expanding Jewish settlements into the West Bank and East Jerusalem, now numbering half a million settlers.\n\nFor the past 17 years, three successive American administrations have tried to achieve the grand-slam of a Middle East agreement, each failing. Preserving the two-state solution for a fourth effort might mean, for now, more modest goals, such as a U.S.-Israeli agreement to limit, if not end, new settlement construction.\n\nThere's an avenue for this.\n\nThe Palestinians have long since acknowledged that any future peace agreement requires small land swaps: chunks of the West Bank given to Israel in exchange for similar pieces of Israel given to the Palestinians. All but about 90,000 Jewish settlers live in about 5% of the West Bank that includes portions of East Jerusalem.\n\nIsrael's defense minister, Avigdor Liberman, suggested in November that Israel could freeze construction of settlements outside those blocs if the U.S. \u2014 and he specifically suggested Trump, who already seems to hold favor with Netanyahu \u2014 would agree to allow new construction within the blocs. The idea would be that those settlement blocs would one day be a part of any land swap in a future Middle East peace agreement. Should an accord one day be reached, settlers living in outposts outside those blocs would either have to move to Israeli territory or become citizens of a new Palestine.\n\nThis isn't a perfect idea. It isn't even a solution. But it could save a solution.\n\nSays Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator under presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, \"We would be doing something that helps to preserve the two-state option, and I think that's in our interest. Because the one-state option is a prescription for enduring conflict.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.222222223877907, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 744, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.2575405213, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6290322580645196, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/11/30/jeh-johnson-all-but-endorses-mccaul-dhs-job/94676544/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Jeh Johnson all but endorses McCaul for DHS job", "wordcount_as_scraped": 529, "date": "20161130190000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The outgoing homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, all but endorsed a possible successor Wednesday, speaking on a panel about future threats to the nation.\n\n\"I don't know anybody who is stronger on border security in Congress,\" Johnson said about Texas Rep.

Trump seems inclined to believe either a) the intelligence community is wrong about Russian involvement, or b) they were involved, but it didn't move the needle for his November victory. On ABC's \"This Week,\" President Obama said he had some words of advice for President-elect Trump: Trust your spies.\n\n\"When I talked to him about our intelligence agencies, what I've said to him is that there are going to be times where you've got raw intelligence that comes in and, in my experience over eight years, the intelligence community is pretty good about saying, 'Look, we can't say for certain what this means,' \" Obama said in an interview with George Stephanopoulos.\n\n\"But there are going to be times where the only way you can make a good decision is if you have confidence that the process is working,\" Obama said. \"And the people that you put in charge are giving you their very best assessments.\"\n\nOffice of Government Ethics: 'Hey, don't rush us'\n\nThe agency tasked with vetting Cabinet picks says it's pretty unlikely they're going to be able to finish reviewing all of Trump's picks before the Senate begins confirmation hearings.

I understand that. But we need to sort of grow up here and get past that ... I'm optimistic we'll be able to get up to seven nominees on day one, just like we did eight years ago.\"\n\nSchaub says Trump broke with tradition by naming Cabinet possibilities without having them pre-cleared by the OGE.

An estimated 2,000 protesters shouted angrily in downtown Seattle, expressing their frustration at the Trump victory over Democrat and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who won 228 electoral votes to Trump's 279.\n\nPolice in riot gear struggled to hold back scores of protesters in some of the cities as protesters chanted \"Not My President\" and \"No Racist USA.\" The protests were mostly peaceful. Seattle police said they were investigating a report of a shooting near the site of the protest in that city, but it may not have involved protesters.\n\nIn Los Angeles, protesters poured into the streets near City Hall and torched a giant Trump effigy, the Los Angeles Times reported. Later in the night, hundreds marched onto the busy 101 Freeway which brought the highway to a complete standstill. The California Highway Patrol and the Los Angeles Police Department \u2014who urged protesters to remain lawful and peaceful \u2014 responded and were seen leading demonstrators away from the busy highway. At least 13 people were later arrested, LAPD Officer Tony Im told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., hundreds took to the streets carrying signs saying \"Nasty Women Fight Back\" and \"White Males for Equality for All.\"\n\nThe unrest culminated when two separate anti-Trump demonstrations converged in front of the Trump International Hotel. They chanted and yelled \"Impeach Donald Trump\" and toward the end yelled at police officers who stood guard at the hotel entrance.\n\nThis is happening in front of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. right now. pic.twitter.com/1G6UXNE7KO\u2014 Natalie DiBlasio (@ndiblasio) November 10, 2016\n\nIn New York, thousands of demonstrators blocked off streets around Trump Tower near the busy intersection of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, chanting \"hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go\" and \"p---y grabs back,\" a reference to taped conversations of Trump making lewd commentary about women.

Videos on social media captured fires erupting as the protests rolled on.\n\nAcross the country, universities and even a few high schools organized post-election civil disobedience of a different sort. Some teachers sent notes to students postponing tests and offering support. Student unions offered sessions of meditation, discussions and tea.\n\n\"The nation in which you currently reside decided last night to elect a president whose own words have painted him a moral and possibly physical hazard to many of us,\" University of Maryland professor Alan Peel wrote to students, postponing all assessments. \"I debated whether to press on today in the spirit of re-establishing normalcy, but have come to realize that my position and my background may have afforded me the privilege to do so. Others may find they do not have that privilege.\"\n\n\"Partisan, inflammatory statements unfortunately seem to be part of modern campaign rhetoric, but they cause real wounds,\" Northwestern University wrote in an email to students Wednesday, reminding them to notify professors if they need to miss class. The email directed students to the campus Multicultural Center, the Gender & Sexuality Resource Center and The Black House, a gathering place for the university's black community. Throughout the day the campus hosted a \"What's Your Reaction\" event for students to express themselves by drawing pictures. They even provided the paper, markers and snacks.\n\nThe University of California, Berkeley created safe spaces for minority students, and for those who might be illegal immigrants.

Trump wants to renegotiate or trash the industry's treasured North American Free Trade Agreement, which he blames for weakening American manufacturing. He has also threatened to impose a 35% tariff on American companies' products made overseas and sold in the U.S.\n\nIn other ways, however, the auto industry is welcoming change, even after eight years of a White House that rescued GM and Chrysler from the clutches of liquidation. \"Automakers are facing a situation where they have to consider the political consequences\" of all of their decisions, AutoTrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nA: Yes. Labor costs for automotive assembly are 80% lower in Mexico than in the U.S., according to an August 2016 report by the Center for Automotive Research. Although security and transportation costs are higher in Mexico, the country still offers considerably lower cost of production, particularly on small, fuel-efficient cars that have thin profit margins.\n\nConsequently, shifting production back to the U.S. likely would hurt the bottom line for automakers and suppliers. \"That could have a pretty substantial impact on profitability,\" LMC Automotive analyst Jeff Schuster said.\n\nA: Hard to say, since details are lacking. But few in the industry believe the threatened 35% tariff is actually feasible. \"I believe 35% is almost inflammatory,\" says Michael Harley, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, noting Ford's 2016 profitability could have been wiped out if it had to pay the tariff. \"It gets everyone's attention, but it's nearly impossible.\"\n\nStill, the pressure on Detroit automakers to reconsider any plans to offshore manufacturing could be persistent and public. That could have profound ramifications on future decisions on automakers' global operations. \"We're going see pressure from Trump and his tweets and you are going to see public scrutiny,\" Harley says. \"This has been ignored by the public in the past decades.\"\n\nA: Possibly, especially if automakers can pull off announcements that generate big headlines for Trump to trumpet while making few substantive changes to their actual policies. Optics may matter more than substance.\n\nBut don't expect a significant shift in manufacturing from Mexico to the U.S. Unless there are dramatic changes in trade policy and tariffs, America's Big 3 automakers are and will likely remain heavily committed to manufacturing overseas. As Ford and other companies have shown, forcing American companies to bring jobs back to the U.S. requires complex reallocation of resources and behind-the-scenes negotiations that include tax benefits. The Center for Automotive Research projected that U.S. share of North American automotive production would fall from an all-time low 63% in 2016 to 58% in 2020.\n\nWith Ford, production of the Focus sedan will still move to Mexico, albeit to an existing plant, instead of a new facility. \"It is a shift but it's not a dramatic change in plans,\" Schuster said. \"It's more moving chess pieces around than it is a significant change in their production strategy.\"\n\nA: Not for now. If Trump follows through on the threat of a 35% tariff, Mexican-made cars will likely become more expensive for American consumers.\n\nTheoretically, though \"it might end up with more jobs here,\" Center for Automotive Research analyst Kristin Dziczek said. \"If we have more jobs, more employment and wages go up, and prices go up too, that's OK. If wages don't go up and prices go up, that's a problem.\"\n\nA: Although expanding in Mexico makes financial sense, Detroit's Big 3 automakers may be willing to relinquish some Mexico production plans in exchange for political concessions in other areas. Currying favor with the Trump administration is important to the auto industry, which wants Washington to loosen fuel-economy regulations and avoid a potentially devastating trade war with China. Ford's move reflects that strategy, Schuster said.\n\n\"There's clearly a lot going on that below's the surface of this,\" Schuster said. \"It's likely to gain some influence on other activity that's coming down the road.\"\n\nA: NAFTA was a singularly influential pact that opened borders among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, and fueled American companies' rush to open factories along the border to take advantage of cheaper labor and costs.\n\nTrump's disdain for NAFTA has been well-chronicled, and his call for tariffs would correspond with his plans to undermine the trade pact. The authority of a president to unilaterally impose a tariff is still subject to much legal debate.\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which administers trade policy enforcement, can apply tariffs based on country and product-specific categories. But a U.S. president has various ways to initiate trade disputes, including imposing restrictions on imports if they pose national security risk.\n\n\"What automakers are looking at is what's down the road,\" Harley says. \"It takes months or years to build a plant. If I were a new manufacturer, I wouldn't be pouring new concrete in Mexico today.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.77296352386475, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1016, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.7574092523799996, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.96850393700787, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/03/inside-njs-37m-secret-prisoner-passageway/96129766/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 925, "scraper_regex": 847}}, "headline": "Inside N.J.'s $3.7M 'secret' prisoner passageway", "wordcount_as_scraped": 847, "date": "20170104000000", "story_content": "TOMS RIVER, N.J. \u2014 Ocean County's $3.7 million planned prisoner walkway to transfer inmates between the jail and the courthouse is, as it turns out, more than just a walkway.\n\nThe project involves the renovation of a \"secret tunnel\" underneath a courtyard, installation of hidden passageways, construction of a private elevator and new holding cells in small additions that will be built onto the connecting points at opposite buildings.\n\nOcean County Administrator Carl W. Block winces at the term \"secret tunnel.\"\n\n\"It's not a secret tunnel,\" Block insisted. \"But once (you) go in there, I can't guarantee you will ever come out.

We already had to put money into the elevator (in the old wing) because the elevator needed major work and is not ADA compliant, so we said, 'While we're doing that, let's look how to connect the jail to the courts without going outside.' And that's what we've done.\"\n\nMichael J. Fiure, director of the Department of Management and Budget, said the major area of construction will be on the second floor where the county plans to construct a walkway adjacent to the courthouse annex.\n\n\"It will be connected to the building,\" Fiure said. \"So we're going to have the building extend out back. It will be along this walkway where sheriff's officers are going to meet up with corrections officers for the tradeoff (of inmates).\"\n\nIt is also here where a secure passageway will be built connected to two new holding cells, that will link to two courtrooms in the east wing annex of the courthouse that are currently being used to hear criminal cases. All of it is designed to keep the inmates segregated from the public, he said.\n\nThis will be the second addition onto the Justice Complex in six years and the latest in nearly a dozen major additions that have been made to the original 1850 courthouse around the corner on Washington Street since the 1920s.\n\nWhen the Ocean County Courthouse was evaluated in 1978 for a place in the National Register of Historic Places, experts were dismayed at the haphazard way in which the building had been added on to over the previous century.\n\nThe original 1850 courthouse, built in the Greek Revival style, had become overpowered by its monstrous east and west wings built in the utilitarian post-World War II style, with little apparent thoughtfulness for the architecture of the original structure.\n\nA labyrinth of hidden walkways concealed behind brick and mortar connected the sections of the complex.\n\n\"The inconsistent treatment of these walkways and the close proximity of the wings to the historic building inhibits a full appreciation of the total proportion and massing of the original courthouse,\" conceded Kevin McGorty, then-director of the Ocean County Cultural and Heritage Commission, in the nomination form to the U.S. Department of Interior.\n\nIn 2012, the freeholder board authorized a major study to evaluate the county government's building needs over the next 30 years. The study recommended a $40 million addition onto the Justice Complex, a cost which some freeholders consider unacceptable.\n\nBlock has said the planned $3.7 million walkway project is unrelated to that project and does not conflict with it.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.06746053695679, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 925, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.31416764752, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104000000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.27027027027027, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/04/ala-family-divided-sessions-ag-nomination/96154582/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 643, "scraper_regex": 746}}, "headline": "Alabama family divided on Jeff Sessions' AG nomination", "wordcount_as_scraped": 746, "date": "20170104180000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 While Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions' nomination as attorney general has stoked divisions largely along political party lines, it also is opening an emotional divide within a prominent Alabama family of civil rights activists whose controversial voter fraud prosecution brought by Sessions three decades ago continues to shadow the nominee.\n\nThe family split spilled into the public debate Wednesday when Albert Turner Jr. issued an endorsement of the nominee, saying that then-U.S. attorney Sessions was \"simply doing his job'' in the prosecution of his parents. Turner is the son of activists Albert and Evelyn Turner, who were acquitted of tampering of tampering with absentee ballots in a racially charged case that helped sink Sessions' previous bid for a federal judgeship.\n\nA third activist, Spencer Hogue, accused of altering ballots in the September 1984 primary election, also was acquitted in the case that became known as the \"Marion Three.\"\n\n\"My differences in policy and ideology with (Sessions) do not translate to personal malice,'' said Turner Jr., now a county commissioner in Perry County, Ala., where his parents were charged more than three decades ago. \"He is not a racist.''\n\nEvelyn Turner, 80, however, made it clear that her son does not speak for the family.\n\n\"I do not need to re-live the hurt I have felt from this case since Day 1,'' the mother said Wednesday. \"It feels like (the prosecution) is happening all over again. As far as I'm concerned, (Sessions) shouldn't be named to catch dogs.''\n\nEvelyn Turner, whose husband died in 2000, said her son is \"old enough to speak for himself,'' but the endorsement of the nominee stopped there.\n\n\"No, I do not agree with that,'' Mrs. Turner said of her son's public endorsement. \"That is not going to change as long as I'm black, I don't think a change is in the cards.''\n\nBut Sessions spokeswoman Sarah Flores said the commissioner's statement represented \"an extremely important statement'' about the 30-year-old fraud case.\n\n\"There have been relentless attacks on the prosecution stating there were false charges and that it was unjustified and racially motivated,'' Flores said. \"Commissioner Turner defends Jeff Sessions' integrity in bringing the case, acknowledging that Sen. Sessions was performing his responsibilities in good faith, acting on evidence provided by the local district attorney, and was 'simply doing his job.' ''\n\nIn his statement of support, Commissioner Turner said some of Sessions' record on issues involving race has been \"distorted and unfair.''\n\n\"My family and I have literally been on the front line of the fight for civil rights my whole life,'' Turner said. \"And while I respect the deeply held positions of other civil rights advocates who oppose Sen. Sessions, I believe it is important for me to speak out with regard to Sen. Sessions, personally.''\n\nTurner said while he and Sessions \"respectfully disagree on some issues,'' he urged other civil rights advocates to \"engage in a constructive dialogue with the nominee'' related to a range of issues, from minority voting rights to gun control.\n\n\"I believe he will be fair in his application of the law and the constitution,'' he said. \"As such, I support his nomination to be the next attorney general of the United States.'' (Senate consideration of Sessions' nomination is set to begin Tuesday before the Judiciary Committee.)\n\nStill, the ''Marion Three'' case remains a open wound within the family.\n\nRobert Turner, brother of Albert Turner Sr. and an Alabama attorney who assisted in his brother's defense, said Wednesday that his nephew's support for Sessions marked a departure from the family's commitment to civil rights.\n\nTurner has said that the Marion activists were merely trying to assist poor and elderly voters in casting ballots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are and there were large numbers of elderly people in Perry County who need assistance,\" Turner said. \"They couldn't get to the polls on their own. As a matter of fact, the technical requirements of completing and mailing (the ballots) were not understood.\"\n\n\n\nA jury of seven blacks and five whites acquitted the three of all charges. The presiding judge threw out more than half of the charges for lack of evidence before the jury received the case.\n\n\n\nDespite that history, Robert Turner said his nephew's decision was not a complete surprise.\n\n\"He (Albert Jr) does stuff and nobody knows why he does it sometimes,'' the 70-year-old Marion, Ala., attorney said. \"He's very active in politics, and like most politicians he has no hesitation in doing things that help him in politics.''", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.7921347618102996, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 643, "FairnessVirtue": 6, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.66597787248, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170104180000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.6656298600311, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/23/trump-big-lie-media-first-amendment-david-andelman-column/96927484/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 771, "scraper_regex": 681}}, "headline": "Trump's Big Lie imperils the republic: David Andelman", "wordcount_as_scraped": 681, "date": "20170123210000", "story_content": "There is an existential danger to the republic in the Big Lie that Donald Trump spoke in front of the Memorial Wall at the Central Intelligence Agency on the first full day of his presidency, and that his press secretary elaborated on only hours later from the podium in the White House press room. \"I have a running war with the media,\" the new president said. \"They are among the most dishonest human beings on earth.\"\n\nTrump, the consummate marketer, understands that if you repeat a lie long enough, eventually people \u2014 even those far outside his inner circle or most fervent supporters \u2014 will believe it. The concept began even before Hitler's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels embraced it as a core tenet of the Third Reich: \"If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.\"\n\nAlready one of the themes of the Trump presidency is that all journalists are liars, the press is unrelievedly corrupt, and the media is in no sense to be trusted as a check on the power of the presidency. When that sinks deeply into the American psyche, it could persist far beyond even his four-year term and will be far more difficult to eradicate.\n\nThe consequences are pernicious, indeed potentially lethal. They go far beyond the undoubtedly toxic influences of fake news, the failure or inability of the American people to distinguish between truth and lies, and the astonishing willingness of the Trump administration to embrace \"alternative facts\" as an acceptable standard. Moreover, with the demonization of most national news media and the canonization of a sliver of fierce loyalists, they risk creating the two-tiered system of propaganda that is the hallmark of autocracies.\n\nIn Russia, China and many other countries, a free or opposition press has been attacked and sometimes suppressed entirely, while government-controlled media outlets are elevated to pedestals. This in turn has translated into repeated cases of journalists being physically attacked and even murdered with impunity, and the right to lock up journalists has gone unquestioned. Last year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), 259 journalists were imprisoned worldwide and 48 were killed.\n\nWhere this is headed is not yet clear. What is clear is Trump's unrelieved commitment, unprecedented in American history, to spreading the idea of a corrupt, lying U.S. press.His drumbeat of hatred directed at the media, which has been embraced and magnified by his aides, is intensifying an already toxic environment of mistrust. Between June 2015 when he declared his candidacy and last Dec. 6, Trump tweeted 613 insults directed at reporters or media outlets, according to a New York Times tabulation.\n\n\"He has, in effect, created an environment that is fostering incivility across the web and particularly against journalists who he has specifically targeted in his tweets and press conferences,\" Michelle Ferrier, a former journalist and founder of TrollBusters, a digital tool to combat online harassment, told CPJ.\n\nFor more than two centuries, since Edmund Burke opened Britain's House of Commons to members of the press in 1787, the core of American democracy \u2014 enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution \u2014 has been the concept Burke called the Fourth Estate: the press as the one institution independent of the three branches of government that serves as a check or monitor on their activities.\n\nTrump placed his hand on two Bibles to swear his allegiance to that Constitution. Hopefully he will embrace all its principles going forward.\n\nDavid A.

Never getting the attention or respect or economic consideration it deserves. Never having a president to call its own.\n\nVery unfair!\n\nSo fitting that the coastal elites are finally getting a taste of our own medicine, right?\n\nI was going to write a funny piece about the high price of Prius repair and how even yoga and kale smoothies can't soothe our nerves at this point. But I don't have a Prius and I hate yoga and kale. Also, this is no joke.\n\nBecause if you want to look at who can't get any respect, there's a good case that it's those of us who happen to live in cities and on coasts. In other words, blue America.\n\nYou want to talk about unfair?\n\nDemocrats won the popular vote in six of the past seven national elections, but got only two presidents out of it instead of four. Al Gore won it by 541,000 in 2000. As of Sunday, Hillary Clinton was more than 700,000 votes ahead of Donald Trump and by some estimates headed toward close to a 2-million-vote \"loss.\"\n\n\"Not real interested in California's 9 million voters deciding every president,\" wrote a Twitter user named plarkin88. Understandable \u2014 but they are people too. Why shouldn't their votes count as much as those in relatively sparsely populated red states? I know, this is the system we have. But is it fair?\n\nAnd while we're on the subject, I'm not real interested in Republicans appointing every Supreme Court justice for eternity. Democrats have held the presidency for 20 years since 1977 but haven't had a high court majority since 1971. When they finally got the chance in February after Justice Antonin Scalia died, Senate Republicans decided they would wait a year, ignore President Obama's nominee, and let the next president decide. Fair? Not in my book.\n\nAs for having a say, Republicans are now completely in charge \u2014 governors and legislatures \u2014 in 24 states, up from 20 before the election. They have partial control in many more. These states are in flyover country, in the South, even in New England. If that's not getting your voice heard, what is?\n\nI get that the federal government has overridden some conservative social moves in some states. There is room for debate on that, but it is the job of the president, Congress and federal courts to make sure all Americans have an equal opportunity to vote and equal protection under the law. That means blocking restrictive laws and making sure same-sex couples can get their marriage licenses. We are a diverse society becoming ever more diverse. That's a demographic fact, and no president can stop the tide.\n\nIt's also a fact that the economy has greatly improved on Obama's watch, but obviously there are areas that are left behind. Rust Belt voters in particular placed their bets on Trump. This is ironic given that Obama saved their auto industry while most Republicans opposed the bailout and Trump himself was both for it and against it.\n\nIt is also ironic since Congress thwarted any number of stimulative Obama initiatives that might have helped lower-income voters, from infrastructure spending to tax breaks for the non-rich.\n\nWorking-class whites may think they've elected an economic champion, but they are likely in for a disappointing four years. If Trump gets the tax plan he proposed, it will massively benefit the elites he attacked in his faux-populist campaign. If he gets the trade wars he seems to want, U.S. consumers will pay higher prices and U.S. goods will cost more overseas \u2014 meaning U.S. workers could lose jobs due to falling demand.\n\nAnd even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell now acknowledges that ending the alleged \"war on coal\" won't necessarily bring back coal jobs. Clean-air regulations are a factor in the decline of coal, but not nearly as significant as competition from cheap natural gas. Hillary Clinton had a plan to help coal areas transition to other industries. Trump vowed to put miners back to work in the mines \u2014 but never said how. That may be another disappointment.\n\nTrump and the GOP are salivating at the prospect of unwinding most of what Obama has done, and some of the New Deal besides. This may include ending access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, privatizing Medicare, reversing U.S. commitments to reducing carbon emissions, and canceling executive actions that gave pay raises to millions and allowed illegal immigrants brought here as kids to legally study, work and pay taxes.\n\nObama made it clear he would have preferred new laws passed by Congress to raise wages, reform immigration, and curb the carbon emissions that scientists say contribute to global warming and all its perils. But what is a president to do except resort to executive action when the stated goal of his political adversaries is to deny him any accomplishments?\n\nAnd that is the ultimate unfairness \u2014 hobbling a two-term president from Day One.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.502008020877838, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 831, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.01235851102, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114140000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.12876052948255, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/25/syrian-refugees-trump-extreme-vetting-column/97043442/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 624, "scraper_regex": 555}}, "headline": "Trump's extreme vetting for refugees? Already here: Column", "wordcount_as_scraped": 555, "date": "20170126030000", "story_content": "During his campaign, Donald Trump vowed that he would impose \"extreme vetting\" of refugees. The president followed through on Friday with an executive order that suspends refugee admissions until tighter security checks are put in place. But extreme vetting already occurs.\n\nFor example, Syrian refugees wait an average of 18 months to 24 months before being admitted to the United States. The 21-step screening process goes through multiple agencies, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the U.S. State Department, the FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Applicants undergo two and sometimes three interagency security checks to make sure nothing disqualifies them for admission to America. Refugee applicants also undergo a comprehensive medical examination to ensure that they don't have a contagious disease.\n\nRefugees continue to be screened after they arrive in the USA. Within a year, they can apply for a green card. Five years later, they can apply to become naturalized U.S. citizens. The federal government conducts background screening procedures at both steps. In fact, the government has a special program called the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program that can delay refugees' and others' applications for years based on alleged national security concerns. Several immigrants have had to sue the U.S. immigration agency to get their cases out of this black hole.\n\nThe Cato Institute calculates that the chance of being killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee is about one in 3.6 billion a year. By comparison, CATO found, your chance of being murdered by anyone is one in 14,000. The head of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services told Congress in September that not a single act of actual terrorist violence has been committed by a refugee \"who has undergone our screening procedures\" since 9/11.\n\nStudies have found that countries benefit economically from refugees because they fill gaps in the labor market and have a dynamic impact on investment and productivity growth. Moreover, most refugees are young, which helps aging societies, especially those with shrinking local working-age populations. In Utica, N.Y., for example, refugees have helped halt economic decline.\n\nTo impose even more extreme vetting would raise the specter of ideological exclusion. We have been down that road and rejected it. During the Cold War, the U.S. excluded and deported immigrants if they expressed views different from our own. In 1990, Congress wisely amended the immigration law to ban exclusion of aliens if their beliefs, statements, or associations would be lawful in America. Barring certain refugees simply because they belong to a particular religion constitutes ideological exclusion.\n\nIt is certainly appropriate to screen refugee applicants carefully. Because we already do that, we should bring more refugees to the USA, not fewer.\n\nBy definition, refugees have fled persecution. Let us not persecute them again by temporarily banning them or unduly delaying their entry into America by imposing additional but unnecessary security background checks. The U.S. should remain a beacon of hope for refugees rather than an unattainable goal because of security concerns, which are already being comprehensively addressed.\n\nA plaque at the Statue of Liberty contains a quote attributed to Ben Franklin: \"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\" Let us remember those words as we deal with the largest refugee crisis since World War II.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.14285707473755, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 624, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 2, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.42330370614, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 8, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 43, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170126030000, "FairnessVice": 3, "pct_mft_words": 6.89102564102564, "mft_mean": 3.9090909090900006}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/23/senate-confirms-pompeo-cia-chief-amid-questions-over-torture-spying-views/96959390/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Senate confirms Pompeo as CIA chief amid questions over torture, spying views", "wordcount_as_scraped": 604, "date": "20170124020000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted Monday to confirm Republican Rep.

Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee and a leading privacy advocate. \"But his record reveals extreme positions, including enthusiasm for sweeping new surveillance programs targeting Americans and an openness to sending our country backward with regard to torture.\"\n\nAs president, Obama banned waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques through an executive order in 2009.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Pompeo said he would \"absolutely not\" bring back those techniques. However, in response to written questions from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he said he would review the current ban on waterboarding if the ban was shown to impede the collection of \"vital intelligence.\"\n\n\"If experts believed current law was an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country, I would want to understand such impediments and whether any recommendations were appropriate for changing current law,\" Pompeo wrote.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., also questioned whether Pompeo would try to bring back the mass collection of Americans' phone records and expand that surveillance to include other personal information about U.S. citizens with no suspected ties to terrorism.\n\nCongress passed the USA Freedom Act in 2015 to stop the National Security Agency from collecting metadata from the phone records of millions of innocent Americans. Pompeo was among the House members who voted to abolish the program, but later called for it to be restored.\n\n\"We (Americans) don't want to be spied on,\" Leahy said. \"I don't question Congressman Pompeo's loyalty to our nation. I do question his stated beliefs that immediate security concerns can be used as a justification for eroding the fundamental rights of Americans.\"\n\nSupporters of Pompeo's confirmation \u2014 including Sen.

But I didn't know that I had taken a course with him until a friend called me, many years later. \"Hey, do you remember our class with Obama?\" he asked.\n\nHe was. Obama will be remembered as our most unlikely president, and not just because he's black. Most of of our modern presidents have been gluttons for attention, seeking affirmation and adulation from everyone around them.\n\nThat wasn't \u2014 and isn't \u2014 Barack Obama. He is a gifted orator, and I'm sure he enjoyed working up a crowd. But he didn't demand to be venerated, the way other presidents did.\n\nWoodrow Wilson told an aide that God ordained him to be president. Richard Nixon routinely referred to himself in the third person, even after he was pushed out of the White House. \"When Nixon was President and Leader of the Free World,\" he'd say . . . and then he'd go on and on.\n\nOther presidents were notoriously abusive towards their staff, another hallmark of arrogance and conceit. Lyndon Johnson made aides sit in the stall next to him while he defecated; he also urinated on a Secret Service agent who was shielding him from public view. \"That's my prerogative,\" Johnson said.\n\nThat's the mantra of the narcissist, of course. The sun and the moon revolve around him. He must be obeyed and worshiped by everyone, but especially by attractive younger women. Johnson told the director of White House personnel to get him the \"prettiest secretaries\" in Washington. \"I want them 25 to 40,\" Johnson specified; no \"broken-down old maids\" need apply, he added.\n\nAlways resentful of his dashing predecessor, John F. Kennedy, Johnson felt further diminished as posthumous stories of JFK's extra-marital affairs surfaced. \"I have had more women by accident than he has had on purpose,\" LBJ would yell. He made sure his wife didn't walk in on him and a mistress in the Oval Office by installing a buzzer.\n\nBill Clinton's dalliances were legion, of course, dating back to the \"bimbo eruptions\" of his gubernatorial years and culminating in the Monica Lewinsky scandal that almost ended his presidency. And he had a temper, too. Clinton and Jimmy Carter both posed as affable Southern gentlemen, but they were also known to fly off the handle behind closed doors.\n\nEven in public, they sometimes flashed their anger. Clinton shouted down a heckler on the campaign trail in 1992. Carter got in a yelling match with Sudanese security officials in 2007 when they blocked him from a town in Darfur where the was trying to meet with refugees.\n\nIt's impossible to imagine Obama behaving that way. Part of that has to do with our ugly heritage of racism, of course: You can't act like \"angry black man\" and get white Americans to vote for you. But mostly, it's just who Obama is. He doesn't get too high or too low. And he doesn't need you to adore him.\n\nBut I'll take diffident over arrogant any day. Sometime in the very distant future, when race doesn't matter like it does now, the most astonishing thing about Obama won't be that he was African American. It will be that he was consistently decent and dignified in an office that attracts mainly blowhards and bullies. In that sense, Donald Trump \u2014 a textbook narcissist \u2014 might not be as different from most of our presidents as many of us have assumed.\n\nI never imagined that the guy sitting next to me in class could be president, and I never imagined that a president could show that much class.

A power of attorney, a document that gives a person permission to make financial decisions for another, can offer the same benefits without the consequences.\n\nBenefits of a joint bank account\n\nAs the co-owner of a joint bank account, an adult child has the same privileges as the parent. With that access, the child can:\n\nSikora's husband suffers from Parkinson's disease, which adds to the family's expenses. The joint bank account prevented financial hardships when her mom died because it covered funeral expenses and remaining bills.\n\nLegal consequences of a joint bank account\n\nA joint bank account carries some legal risks for parents and children, Colorado attorney Catherine Seal says. These legal consequences vary by state, and they can cause financial hardships.\n\nSafer options\n\nA convenience account \u2014 available at some banks in some states \u2014 can be slightly safer.\n\n\"This account is opened with the understanding of both parties that after the parent dies, the account is not intended as a gift to the co-owner of the account,\" says New York attorney Linda Toga.\n\nToga says a power of attorney is better because a convenience account is still a joint account with many of the legal risks mentioned above. With a power of attorney, the parent remains as the owner of the bank account and the adult child is chosen as the agent to make financial decisions.\n\nElizabeth Miller and her three sisters share power of attorney for her mom, Carole. They monitor her account carefully to guard against fraud and have been able to get money back from questionable transactions.\n\n\"We have to all be paying attention to protect my mom because she is gullible and innocent,\" Miller says.\n\nA power of attorney can cost several hundred dollars, depending on how complex it is. Online legal services or legal aid clinics can lower the cost. Forms may also be available for free on your state's website, but you risk leaving something out by doing it on your own.\n\nIt's never too early to plan\n\nIt's difficult for both child and parent to make peace with their roles being reversed. After Sikora's mom died, Sikora found out her mom was still trying to track her own finances in the little notebook she was so attached to. Sikora's mom didn't fully accept the transition, but it was bearable because Sikora initiated conversations well in advance of when changes took place.\n\n\"The dialogue needs to start years before the need occurs,\" Sikora says.\n\nShe didn't wait until it was too late, and neither should you.\n\nPower of attorney online resources\n\nWhile many legal experts recommend you get professional help, if you wish to try on your own, here are two sites to consider:\n\nLegal Zoom: legalzoom.com\n\nNolo: nolo.com\n\nMORE: NerdWallet's best checking accounts\n\nMORE: What is a senior checking account?\n\nMORE: The uncomfortable questions Baby Boomers need to ask their parents\n\nMelissa Lambarena is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

No one was especially happy that a white British actor would play black American King of Pop when the news came out last year, but members of Jackson's family were especially ticked off when the trailer dropped Tuesday. Fiennes' prosthetics-heavy face did not remotely resemble Jackson's. Daughter Paris Jackson posted on Twitter she was \"so incredibly offended\" she wanted to vomit. Nephew Taj Jackson also was turned off. \"Unfortunately this is what my family has to deal with. No words could express the blatant disrespect,\" he said on Twitter. The social media backlash worked: Britain's Sky TV announced it will not air the episode of Urban Myths (the U.K. answer to Drunk History) featuring Fiennes.

A week before the new inauguration, the Bush twins wrote again to the Obama girls, in a letter posted on Time, about how to enjoy life as members of \"another rarified club, one of former First Children.\" Take heart, the twins said, there's so much to look forward to, including college, exploring their passions and making mistakes. \"You will be writing the story of your lives, beyond the shadow of your famous parents, yet you will always carry with you the experiences of the past eight years.\"\n\nKim Kardashian's Paris armed robbery was only a few months ago and already some over-sharers seem to have forgotten one of its lessons: Posting pictures of your bling on social media might be tempting to the wrong people.

It sure looks like the one on Tiffany's website, the one that costs $100,000. \"Looking at 2017 like... mmmhmmm u gonna get it...,\" JLo captioned the photo.

A new study released Thursday found that just 7% of the 250 highest-grossing films of 2016 were directed by women.

In fact, the 2016 statistics are on par with those of ...1998? And this after last year's federal investigation of possible discrimination against female directors in film and TV, plus increased attention to diversity in recent years? Recent efforts to improve the numbers, such as the mentoring and shadowing programs, are \"simply too meager,\" said Martha Lauzen, executive director of the center and author of the report, The Celluloid Ceiling.

Ill-conceived laws got in the way. And once again, innocent people died.\n\nIt's not as though there were no red flags. Two months before the airport rampage, Santiago, agitated and incoherent, walked into the FBI office in Anchorage and told agents his mind had been taken over by a U.S. intelligence agency. He said he was having terrorist thoughts and believed he was being influenced by the Islamic State terrorist group. He had a loaded magazine on him and a gun in his car.\n\nThe FBI called local police, who confiscated the gun for safekeeping and took Santiago to a mental health facility where, police said, he was admitted.\n\nYet Santiago was out of the hospital before the end of the month. Exactly when and why have not been revealed. But if Santiago's delusions didn't qualify for longer-term treatment, it's hard to imagine what would. Even more alarming, not only was he able to retrieve his gun, but Anchorage police sent him a letter inviting him to come and get it.\n\nThat he did, and last Friday, Santiago flew to Fort Lauderdale with the Walther 9mm semiautomatic handgun in a checked bag, which is legal, and went on a rampage. The episode is all the more shocking because of its familiar ring \u2014 another young man with untreated mental illness and a mass killing.\n\nVirginia Tech's Seung Hui Cho, who killed 32, was delusional. Jared Loughner, killer of six at a Tucson strip mall, had scared classmates at his community college, which banned him from campus. Aaron Alexis, who fatally shot 12 at the Washington Navy Yard, had long exhibited symptoms of mental illness.\n\nChanging this horrific pattern involves tackling a complex web of problems.\n\nIn many states, it is almost impossible to involuntarily commit someone even if he is \u2014 as Santiago surely seemed \u2014 delusional. Many states, which understandably set high standards to prevent individuals from being railroaded into institutions, have set them so high that almost no one qualifies.\n\nThe laws focus too much on an individual's dangerousness, rather on other indicators of illness such as the inability to determine that they need help. Alaska sets not only a high bar, but according to a recent study, the danger must also be \"imminent.\" Such strictures and the lack of mental health beds in many states combine to dissuade commitments.\n\nAs for federal gun laws, mental illness disqualifies people from buying or possessing a gun only after they've been involuntarily committed by a court. Even when people fall into this category \u2014 or other prohibited categories \u2014 few states bother to take guns away. Most rely on the honor system. Alaska, for instance, has no law requiring relinquishment. Compare that with the Anchorage police diligence in notifying Santiago to come get his weapon.\n\nThe mental health laws might be as tough to change as gun laws, leaving a difficult path forward.\n\nA few states have found a promising solution. A handful allow police or family members to seek a \"gun restraining order\" in court against a person who presents a credible risk for violence. If a judge agrees, the person is barred from buying a gun or keeping ones he owns. In Connecticut, the law is credited with preventing as many as 100 suicides from 1999 through 2013. New laws in California and Washington were approved in ballot measures, despite vehement opposition from the gun lobby.\n\nThe key to preventing future Fort Lauderdales is to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, not to return firearms to them on a silver platter.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.9295773506164595, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 730, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.19865674287, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.56164383561644, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2016/11/19/these-5-cars-have-the-worst-resale-value/93715126/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1072, "scraper_regex": 734}}, "headline": "These 5 cars have the worst resale value", "wordcount_as_scraped": 734, "date": "20161119190000", "story_content": "Other mistakes car buyers made include:\n\nFor certain, there are very few cars that can retain their value over the years, and every car buyer has heard the saying that a new car drops in value as soon as it's driven off of the dealer's lot.\n\nLet your fingers do the walking\n\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. Car shoppers have a number of tools readily available to them to determine the value of a vehicle, new or used, and whether those values will hold up over time. Kelley Blue Book (KBB) and Edmunds.com may be two of the most recognized names in the industry that consumers turn to when shopping for a car, but the National Automobile Dealers Association trade group has its own \"book\" that used to be available exclusively to dealers, though it's since created a website consumers can peruse, too.\n\nRecently, Kelley released its third-quarter 2016 survey on retention values for manufacturer-suggested retail prices when a car that's anywhere from one to three years old goes to auction. The results are not encouraging.\n\nAccording to KBB analyst Sean Foyil, even though the cost of such vehicles has remained stable over the past few years, retention values fell by almost 5% in the third quarter, or by roughly $807. Even though the cars come loaded with better equipment packages than vehicles in the past, prices are still falling. He says this is a sign \"buyers at auction are not willing to pay a premium for these vehicles due to the saturation of vehicles available in the market.\"\n\nWhile 4% or so is the average decline in MSRP at auction, some cars performed much worse than average. Here are the five worst cars for model years 2013 to 2015 for retained value in the third quarter, as compiled by KBB.\n\n5. Acura RDX (-14.3%)\n\n4. Lexus HS (-14.6%)\n\n3. Ford C-MAX Hybrid (-14.7%)\n\nFord (NYSE: F) introduced the C-Max as its first hybrid-only line of vehicles in 2003, but only to European car buyers. It wasn't until the 2013 model year that U.S. buyers had a chance to drive one. Its most notable feature was its gasoline-electric powertrain that had a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine working in conjunction with an 88-kilowatt permanent magnet AC synchronous motor. It's gotten mixed reviews, however, with KBB and Edmunds giving it four stars, but Car & Driver giving it just three.\n\n2. Infiniti Q60 (-14.7%)\n\nA Nissan(NASDAQOTH: NSANY)-family vehicle, the Q60 was the successor to Infiniti G-series, but it never really caught on with buyers of high-end luxury cars. Models such as the 2013 lineup earned only three stars or so from the price-guide services, though later models did better. But it also offered upgrades to it that served to confuse people. The IPL model, for example, which stands for \"Infiniti Performance Line,\" charged more for what seemed like very little actual or even practical increase in performance.\n\n1. Mitsubishi Galant (-17.8%)\n\nThe granddaddy of the group, the Mitsubishi Galant was first introduced back in 1969, but much like the Lexus HS, it saw its lineage come to an end with the 2012 model year. It was originally sold in the U.S. in 1971 as a Dodge Colt and ended its existence as Mitsubishi's ninth-generation sedan built on a midsize front-wheel-drive platform. While it might not have earned stellar reviews from professional car sites, owners seemed to like it, and on Cars.com the 2012 model year actually has a 4.5-star rating.\n\nThe loss in value the Galant suffered, like the Lexus, probably has more to do with the fact the cars have been discontinued, meaning it becomes much more difficult to get parts for a vehicle. Regular service and routine maintenance may be easy enough, but when a manufacturer stops making a Saturn, Saab, or Galant, it means the time involved and expense in tracking down replacement parts is going to increase. That will serve to undermine any residual value a car may hold.\n\nOffer from the Motley Fool: A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity\n\n\nThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Trump's executive order was broad, and it's not clear yet how his administration will implement it.\n\nThe proposal unveiled on Monday, sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, could provide a starting point for the Obamacare replacement debate. But the Cassidy-Collins bill also includes several controversial provisions \u2014 including at least temporarily keeping all the tax increases included in Obamacare to pay for their alternative \u2014 that could be nonstarters within their own party.\n\nIn its draft form, the Cassidy-Collins bill would give states three options:\n\n\u2022 Keep the Affordable Care Act, with individuals and small businesses able to purchase insurance on state exchanges and low-income residents eligible for federal subsidies to cover the cost of that coverage. States that expanded Medicaid, a state-federal health program for the poor, would be able to maintain that.\n\n\u2022 Give states most of the federal funding promised under Obamacare, the 95 percent of the subsidies and all the Medicaid expansion money, to create tax-free Health Savings Accounts for low-income residents. Those individuals could then use the money in their HSAs to purchase insurance and pay for their health care.\n\n\u2022 Reject any federal assistance, risking a spike in the uninsured rates and uncertainty in their insurance markets.\n\n\"The power is best held by individuals and the states,\" said Cassidy, a physician.\n\n\"California and New York, you love Obamacare, you can keep it,\" the Louisiana Republican said, but states that want to try something different can choose among the other two options.\n\nBut the Senate's top Democrat, Charles Schumer of New York, blasted the GOP plan as unworkable and an \"empty fa\u00e7ade\" that would create chaos in the marketplace.\n\n\"Millions of Americans would be kicked off their plans, out-of-pocket costs and deductibles for consumers would skyrocket, employer-based coverage for working families would be disrupted, and protections for people with pre-existing conditions, such as cancer, would be gutted,\" Schumer said. \"It is nearly impossible to keep the benefits of the Affordable Care Act without keeping the whole thing.\"\n\nRon Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a left-leaning health advocacy group, noted that bill promotes HSAs, which he said are designed to go with high-deductible catastrophic insurance plans, rather than more traditional coverage. And he said the states that choose to enact that option would receive fewer federal dollars--95 percent of the federal subsidies--which would inevitably translate into higher costs and reduced coverage for low-income Americans.\n\n\"This is a major step backwards,\" Pollack said.\n\nCollins said it's vital to get the Obamacare replacement debate started as soon as possible. The ACA is not working, she said, and the GOP's talk about replacement, without providing specifics, is sowing further confusion for health care consumers and providers.\n\nCollins suggested that Trump did not help matters with his executive order.\n\n\"The executive order is very confusing, and we really don't know yet what the impact would be,\" she said. \"We need legislation.\"\n\nIn addition to the three broad options for states, the Cassidy-Collins bill would also preserve three of Obamacare's most popular protections:\n\n\u2022 Insurers would be barred from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions;\n\n\u2022 Insurers would be prohibited from enacting annual and lifetime caps in their coverage; and\n\n\u2022 Young people would be allowed to stay on their parents plans until age 26.\n\nCassidy conceded that he had no commitment from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to make his bill the primary vehicle for GOP leadership's replacement. \"Republican leadership is waiting to see how this plays out,\" he said.\n\nHe also sidestepped a question about whether his GOP colleagues would agree to any proposal that preserves even a scaled-back version of Obamacare \u2014 and that maintains the tax increases enacted under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Many Republicans have advocated for a full repeal of the ACA \u2014 with the taxes a prime target.\n\nCassidy noted the health care industry agreed to those new taxes when Democrats were crafting the ACA, suggesting that those interests would go along with keeping them in place. And, he added, Republicans will need some source of revenue to pay for any alternative, although there is no consensus about where that revenue should come from.\n\nThe Cassidy-Collins bill, co-sponsored by two other Republicans, envisions a lengthy transition period, with states having two years to choose and implement their path forward. Even after 2020, when the bill would be fully in place, Cassidy said states could still choose to switch gears.\n\nHe portrayed his bill as the only measure that would fulfill all the promises Trump and Republicans in Congress have made about their replacement \u2014 including that no one who has insurance now will lose it, that they will keep the consumer protections, and that they will rein in the spiraling costs of premiums.\n\n\"There's not many ways to get there,\" Cassidy said. \"\u2026 And none better than this.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.657894730567932, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 781, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.10804491916, "HarmVirtue": 13, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0729833546735, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/01/26/97084612/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00fa": [1909, 3885], "\u00ed": [3101]}}, "headline": "Journalists at Inaugural protests charged with felonies", "wordcount_as_scraped": 968, "date": "20170127000000", "story_content": "Six journalists await their legal fates after they were among the 230 people charged with rioting during the Inauguration Day events in downtown Washington.\n\nThe felony charge of \"Rioting or inciting to riot,\" carries the potential for 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000.

Damage caused was in excess of $100,000, police say, and some police officers were injured as protesters resisted arrest; one officer was taken to the hospital and since released.\n\n\"Based on the facts and circumstances, we determined that probable cause existed to support the filing of felony rioting charges,\" said the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia in a statement about the 230 arrested. The office, which enforces criminal laws in Washington, D.C., would not comment on the actions of the six journalists.\n\nThe journalists charged were: Evan Engel, a senior producer with online news site Vocativ; Alex Rubinstein of RT America, the Washington-based channel that is part of RT, the state-sponsored media outlet originally known as Russia Today; documentary filmmaker Jack Keller, independent live-streaming journalist Matthew Hopard, freelance journalist Aaron Cant\u00fa, who has written for Vice and The Guardian, and independent photojournalist Shay Horse.\n\nThe charges were first reported by U.K.'s The Guardian.\n\nLegal observers and medical personnel were also among the large group that police surrounded before arresting them, said Keller, who was covering the protests for the web series Story of America and the team's upcoming documentary film on the social-political division in the U.S. called Journey into the Divide in the U.S. He was returned his video camera after being released, but not the video.\n\n\"I want to make it absolutely clear, as I did to the arresting officer, that I was there as a journalist and was simply observing the J20 protest,\" he said in statement emailed to USA TODAY. \"My hope is that the DA will drop these charges-for which they have no supporting evidence- against journalists and observers immediately.\"\n\nPress advocates have rushed to the journalists' support, demanding the U.S. Attorney's Office drop the charges on those working to cover the protests.\n\n\"These charges are clearly inappropriate, and we are concerned that they could send a chilling message to journalists covering future protests,\" said Carlos Laur\u00eda, senior Americas program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. \"We call on authorities in Washington to drop these charges immediately.\"\n\nAt free speech organization PEN America, Executive Director Suzanne Nossel said, \"By slapping these journalists with felony charges, the U.S. Attorney's office is intimidating the press at a time when mass protests are expanding and there is a pressing need for accurate reporting in the public interest.\"\n\nThe blurring line between activists and activist journalists may be a factor in what happens next. Slay Horse also calls himself an anarchist on his Twitter feed (@huntedhorse) and was documenting the protest. The Committee to Protect Journalists mentioned just three of the six journalists -- Engel, Rubinstein and Cant\u00fa in its appeal; PEN America mentioned them and Keller.\n\nHere is the flash grenade they used that blinded me and left my ears ringing.

Pool said he had previously been arrested and held in Ferguson, Mo., for \"about an hour\" before being released.\n\nI am with a large blocked in by police at 12 and L. Lt.

Metropolitan Police Department \"respects and protects the rights of journalists to have access and the ability to report on events of local, as well as national, importance,\" said spokesman Dustin Sternbeck in a statement. \"MPD members are directed to attempt to identify journalists and to not arrest them.\"\n\nThose individuals who presented appropriate media credentials or could otherwise confirm to be journalists were released.\"\n\nThere is the potential for charges to be dropped. The U.S. Attorney's Office said the office continues to work with police to review evidence and, \"as in all of our cases, we are always willing to consider additional information that people bring forward.\"\n\nThe journalists who responded to contact from USA TODAY directed further communication through their attorneys. Vocativ issued this statement about Engel's arrest: \"The arrest, detainment and rioting charge against journalist Evan Engel who was covering the protests for Vocativ are an affront to the First Amendment and journalistic freedom. Vocativ will vigorously contest this unfounded and outrageous charge.\"\n\nStill in a kettle, probably being arrested with about 200 people #DisruptJ20pic.twitter.com/iOhFLFtPlZ\u2014 Shay Horse (@HuntedHorse) January 20, 2017", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 11, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.26702976226807, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 951, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.14010819518, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.20609884332282, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/11/12/after-tough-election-loss-florida-democrats-regroup-and-look-ahead/93663084/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "After tough election loss, Florida Democrats regroup and look ahead", "wordcount_as_scraped": 865, "date": "20161112130000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 It was supposed to be a week of celebration for Florida Democrats who expected to deliver the presidency to Hillary Clinton and, if things went exceedingly well, topple Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nInstead, party leaders and activists were left forlornly looking ahead to key elections in 2018 (U.S. senator, governor, the state legislature) and another crack at the White House in 2020.\n\nThat pivot began Friday with the announcement by Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Allison Tant that she would not seek re-election in January.\n\n\"I will use the remainder of my term to ensure that the next chair is able to hit the ground running on day one with as smooth of a transition as possible,\" she wrote in a letter to Democratic Executive Committee.\n\nDemocrats in the nation's most important swing state have a lot to chew over.\n\nTrump won the state by nearly 120,000 votes Tuesday and Clinton won only nine of Florida's 67 counties: Alachua, Broward, Gadsden, Hillsborough, Leon, Miami-Dade, Orange Osceola and Palm Beach. And Rubio coasted to a second term over Democratic congressman Patrick Murphy.\n\nThe first task at hand is reclaiming the governor's mansion in 2018, which Democrats haven't won since Lawton Chiles captured it in 1994.\n\nSeveral names have been mentioned, including U.S. Rep Gwen Graham, D-Tallahassee, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, and Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn. Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam is considered the early GOP frontrunner though incoming Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran has also hinted at a run for governor.\n\nEqually important for Democrats is protecting Bill Nelson's Senate seat.\n\n\"One of only three senators representing the South (along with Clinton running mate Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both of Virginia), Nelson remains the only statewide elected Democrat in Florida. He's likely to face stiff competition from GOP Gov. Rick Scott.\"\n\nIn addition, all 120 seats will be up in the state House as well as some state Senate seats due to recently redrawn districts.\n\nThen, of course, the presidential election looms four years from now.\n\nFlorida Democrats say they must connect better with working class voters whose angst about the economy helped propel Trump to victory.\n\n\"We have to let them know that they're included in our vision for the future,\" said Gillum, who was considered as Clinton's running mate. \"We should let people know we're in tune and that we have plans to make their lives a little easier, rather than the impression that we're aloof and disconnected.\"\n\nIt didn't help that the Clinton campaign brought in out-of-state consultants who didn't know the local terrain, said Al Lawson, a Tallahassee Democrat who won a congressional seat Tuesday.\n\n\"I've seen people from all over the place \u2013 California, New York \u2013 and we have all these people here who are just as good but they're not hired,\" Lawson said. \"And those (local) people resent that.\"\n\nSome activists expressed frustration that the state party under Tant often ignored areas of the state that were not Democratic strongholds.\n\nJeffrey Kushner, former Democratic chairman in staunchly Republican Lee County, said a little more money would make a difference. Southwest Florida is not turning Democratic any time soon but having more resources would help blunt the region's GOP advantage and aid statewide Democratic candidates.\n\nTrump won Lee County 59-38% over Clinton. In 2012, Romney's margin of victory was four percentage points smaller \u2013 58-41% \u2013 which allowed Obama to win Florida in whisker-thin fashion by dominating in bluer parts of the state.\n\n\"Right after an election like this where we got trounced, you're going to see a lot of Democrats abandon the local party for a while and that's going to make it even more difficult at the local level for Democrats to pay the rent, have functions, discuss issues, things like that,\" Kushner said. \"If the state party would help out a little, it would make it easier. You could get working on the grassroots again which is what's going to have to happen.\"\n\nOne of the few wins for Florida Democrats on Election Day was the congressional campaign for former Gov. Charlie Crist, who ousted GOP incumbent David Jolly in the St. Petersburg area.\n\nCrist's top campaign adviser, Tallahassee-based strategist Kevin Cate, said the wave of sentiment that helped launch Trump's victory could be followed by a competing wave in 2018. He pointed to 2008 when Obama's presidential win was followed two years later by the Tea Party movement that helped elect Republican newcomers in Florida like Scott.\n\nLike Gillum, Cate said Clinton's loss is a chance to learn why America's frustrated middle class was not listening.\n\n\"We weren't speaking the same language as a lot of middle class white working families,\" Cate said. \"This is an opportunity to get out in the real world and hear why people are angry.\"\n\nDemocrats will also need to reassess how they communicate with voters. Trump grabbed attention of voters and news cycles through social media sites like Twitter, he said.\n\n\"Basically the entire campaign was dictated by whatever came out of the megaphone that is Donald Trump's mouth,\" Cate said. \"While everyone else was having quiet conversations, there was a guy standing in the corner of a room who was driving the message.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.420168071985245, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 890, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.47398356341, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161112130000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.80898876404494, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/06/judge-denies-bail-suspects-charged-facebook-live-attack/96264132/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Judge denies bail for suspects charged in Facebook Live attack", "wordcount_as_scraped": 853, "date": "20170106230000", "story_content": "CHICAGO - A Cook County judge denied bail Friday for four suspects charged with the torture and beating of an 18-year-old man with mental health challenges that was broadcast on Facebook Live.\n\nAssistant State's Attorney Erin Antonietti said that two of the suspects ordered the victim, who suffered from schizophrenia and was assaulted and humiliated for hours, to say \"I love black people\" and \"f--- Trump.\" The suspects also repeatedly beat the teen and two of the suspects shoved his head into a toilet and made him drink from it, prosecutors said\n\n\"Where was your sense of decency?\" asked Cook County Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil before rejecting the suspects plea for a reasonable bail.\n\nThe Cook County prosecutors office charged Jordan Hill, 18, of Chicago; Tesfaye Cooper, 18, of Cicero, Ill.; and sisters Brittany Covington, 18; and Tanishia Covington, 24, of Chicago, with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and residential burglary in the alleged torture and kidnapping of the special-needs teen.\n\nProsecutors cited both the victim's race - he is white - and disability as why he was targeted by the suspects. Those factors allowed authorities to charge the suspects with a hate crime.\n\nHill also was charged with robbery and possession of a stolen motor vehicle.\n\nAntonietti said that victim and Hill knew each other after attending the same alternative high school in suburban Chicago.\n\nThe victim's mother dropped him off on Dec. 31 at a McDonald's in suburban Streamwood, so he could meet a friend who turned out to be Hill.\n\nAfter leaving McDonald's, Hill, the victim and a third unidentified person went to buy and smoke marijuana, authorities said.\n\nThe teen contacted his mother on that day and again on New Year's Day to tell her he wanted to spend the night at his friend Jordan's home. But the victim's family said they stopped hearing from the victim on Monday and were concerned, prosecutors said.\n\nThe victim's brother was able to figure out by logging on the victim's Facebook page that he was with Hill. The victim's mother reached out to Hill through Facebook and requested he put her in contact with her son, who investigators later learned had driven to the West Side of Chicago with Hill and a second unidentified individual in a stolen van.\n\nAt some point, Hill had become angry that the victim's mother had contacted him, and beat the victim in the back of the van. He also took the victim's cell phone and SIM card and then took him to him to the apartment on the city's West Side, where Brittany and Tanishia Covington lived.\n\n\"Defendant Hill and the victim entered the third floor apartment where they were met by defendant Cooper, defendant Britannia Covington and defendant Tanishia Covington,\" Antonietti said. \"Hill and Cooper ordered the victim into a corner and to face the wall. Defendants Hill and Cooper yelled and screamed at the victim while Hill was armed with a knife. The victim was made to say 'I love black people,' and 'F--- Trump.'\"\n\nThe two teens continued to mock and beat the teen, and would force him to drink toilet water. Brittany Covington began livestreaming the assault on Facebook, in which all four can be heard or seen taunting and beating the victim.\n\nDuring the nearly 30 minute Facebook Live post, which went viral, Hill used a knife to cut a chunk of the victims hair, causing his head to bleed. Hill also stabbed the victim in his left forearm, prosecutors said.\n\nAll four suspects allegedly beat the victim and used knives to cut his clothes. The video also shows the victim with duct tape around his mouth and belts tied around his arms, while the assailants can be heard speaking disparagingly of the president-elect and white people.\n\nDuring the course of the attack, Hill also contacted the victim's mother and demanded $300 ransom in exchange for her son.\n\nPolice said a downstairs neighbor threatened to report the suspects over the noise. The suspects were angered by the threat, and went downstairs to threaten the neighbors, giving the victim a chance to escape.\n\n\"Both the female defendants and Cooper chased the witnesses back down into their second floor apartment after Hill threatened he was going to come back with a gun,\" Antonietti said. \"Defendant Cooper kicked in the door of the second floor unit and he and and the two females entered the...apartment while the witnesses ran out the back door and went to the first floor neighbors to call 911.\"\n\nThe bloodied and battered victim was spotted by police Tuesday afternoon walking along a sidewalk in cold weather wearing only sandals, shorts and a tank top turned inside out and backward.\n\nThe victim has since been reunited with his family.\n\nAfter the judge denied the four suspects bail, Priscilla Covington, the grandmother of the two sisters charged in the attack, expressed anguish as she left the courthouse.\n\n\"I didn't raise them that way,\" she told reporters.\n\nA GoFundMe campaign to assist the victim has been launched.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Chicago correspondent Aamer Madhani on Twitter: @AamerISmad", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -11.4503812789917, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 848, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.10387958095, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170106230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.716981132075469, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2017/01/18/kellogg-cutbacks/96722372/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [1644, 1948, 1979]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1018, "scraper_regex": 936}}, "headline": "Kellogg to cut 250 jobs from North American workforce", "wordcount_as_scraped": 936, "date": "20170118230000", "story_content": "BATTLE CREEK, Mich. \u2014 Kellogg Co. plans to cut 250 jobs from its North American operations as a part of the company's cost-cutting program, the chief executive of Battle Creek's economic-development partnership said Wednesday.\n\nKellogg (K) \u2014 which makes Eggo frozen waffles, Kashi products, Keebler cookies and crackers, MorningStar Farms meatless foods, Pop-Tarts and Pringles in addition to its cereals \u2014 confirmed the report in a statement Wednesday but did not provide details.\n\nKellogg is \"focused on eliminating work that doesn't drive the highest returns\" and becoming more efficient by removing a duplication of work within the company, Chief Executive Joe Sobieralski of Battle Creek Unlimited \u2014 a partnership with the city, chamber of commerce and tourism officials \u2014 informed his board of directors via email.

The goal of the four-year plan is to generate $425 million to $475 million in annual savings by 2018, the company told investors on its website.\n\nIt is unclear exactly how many employees will be affected at its headquarters here and in its North American Global Business Services operation in Grand Rapids, Mich.\n\nKellogg has cereal manufacturing plants in Battle Creek; Lancaster, Pa.; Memphis; and Omaha, Neb.; Belleville, Ontario, in Canada; and Mexicali, Quer\u00e9taro and Toluca in Mexico. A dozen other plants in the U.S. and one in Mexico make snacks, five plants make frozen foods, and four make what the company calls noncereal items, according to its website.\n\nIts Canadian headquarters is in Mississauga, Ontario, and its Latin American headquarters is in Quer\u00e9taro City in the state of Quer\u00e9taro in central Mexico.\n\nKellogg, which has manufacturing operations in 18 countries, closed a London, Ontario, cereal plant in December 2014, putting 500 employees out of work, according to CBC News | Windsor.\n\nMore recently, it confirmed these closures and layoffs that amounted to almost 1,000 jobs, not listed among its investor news releases:\n\n\u2022 Charlotte, N.C.

It opened a cereal cafe on July 4 in Manhattan's Times Square area to promote cereal as a food that's not just for breakfast but also a snack and nighttime treat.\n\nOn Wednesday, the company confirmed Sobieralski's layoff report but did not say which departments will be affected, how it determined which jobs are being reduced or how many Battle Creek employees could lose jobs.\n\nWorldwide, the company said it had 33,577 employees as of Jan. 2, 2016. It did not release numbers for North America or the United States.\n\nOfficials plan to release fourth-quarter and 2016 financial results Feb. 9.\n\nIts third-quarter sales exceeded expectations, up 2.2% to $3.3 billion worldwide but down 4.5% to $9.9 billion from January to Oct. 3, said John Bryant, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive. Third-quarter profits jumped 22.9% to $334 million, in part because of some lower one-time costs; that contributed to a 14.8% increase in year-to-date profits to $1.3 billion.\n\n\"As we see the announcement of 250 North American colleagues, obviously, Battle Creek is headquartered here, so we don't know the full impact of the jobs affected here in Battle Creek, if any at all,\" Sobieralski said. \"This is No. 3 of the (losses in) cereal industries in Battle Creek, and it really speaks to the industry as a whole. It isn't just a Battle Creek issue, but it hits more home because we're Cereal City USA.\"\n\nIn November, TreeHouse Foods here said it was cutting 100 jobs from its ready-to-eat cereal plant. Those cuts, knocking out 63% of the factory's workforce, are expected to begin this year and take place over 15 month.\n\nThe following month, Post Consumer Brands said it planned to shift some of its Battle Creek's cereal production to other facilities.

Company cofounder Roni Frank, who is head of Talkspace clinical services (although she herself is not a therapist), described herself as fiercely interested in \"the mental health care crisis in America.\"\n\nShe's right about the scope of the problem. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, in 2014 there were an estimated 44 million adults with mental illness. That's just over 18% of all U.S. adults, with fewer than half of them receiving treatment, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nThat means there are tens of millions completely untreated each year. \"That is the problem we are solving,\" Frank said.\n\nAnd that's what I paid for. After I signed up, I quickly received a text message from my \"Matching Agent,\" who told me she was a licensed therapist and that she was glad I'd subscribed, then asked if I had any other questions before I was to begin spilling my guts to my therapist.\n\nMy big question was, \"how does this therapy compare to in person therapy?\"\n\nWhile there's some research that that shows empirically based, well-designed mental health apps can improve patient outcomes, most of these apps are unstudied and unregulated, says John Torous, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School, who is also chair of the American Psychiatric Association apps review workgroup. He says that consumers should beware, especially for a service that is relatively new. Frank did not disagree, telling me that \"like any new industry, [online therapy] poses new questions and challenges.\"\n\nIt's easy to imagine scenarios where this kind of \"digital psychology\" (which includes variations that use FaceTime, Skype, Google Hangouts, and Vsee in addition to texting) could be very helpful: For those who live in remote areas without access to mental health clinics; or who worry about their anonymity (a young gay person struggling with coming out, for example, or someone who's been sexually assaulted); or those who might find it unsettling to disclose intimate information\u2014in person\u2014to a stranger.\n\nPerhaps even more commonly, these inexpensive therapy options can bring help to those who would otherwise be priced out. I'm all for that.\n\n\"Proper, effective mental health apps\u2014when constructed properly\u2014can fill in some of these gaps, provide some of the therapy interventions, and make it easier for people to get the help they deserve to live a better quality of life,\" says Steven Chan, MD, a UCSF physician and vice chair of the APA apps review workgroup.\n\nMy biggest worry was about privacy and security. I joined Talkspace only a few days after Yahoo in September disclosed a breach that compromised 500 million user accounts and data.\n\nPrivacy has been a big issue for me ever since my laptop was hacked on a plane last year. I had learned a great deal about cyber security after being hacked\u2014the importance of end-to-end encryption, virtual private networks, and complex passwords. No one associated with Talkspace ever asked me about security on my own devices, even during my intake, which would have been easy to do. I knew I was well buttoned-up on my side, but about those thousands of other clients using the app?\n\n\"Digital privacy and security are not often high-level risk factors when prescribing a medication or conducting in-person therapy,\" explained Harvard's Torous. But when it comes to apps, he said they are \"extremely important and should be the first area considered.\"\n\nTo help consumers make better-informed decisions, late last year the American Psychiatric Association (APA) developed an app evaluation model. The report outlines ten questions for consumers to ask to weigh risks and benefits: Is there a privacy policy? What data is collected? Can you opt out? What security measures are in place? Is data encrypted on the device and the server? Does it say it meets HIPPA privacy standards? Based on those criteria, users can score the app for themselves.\n\nI asked Torous to do that for Talkspace, with the result being what he called a \"mixed bag.\" Although the marketing language that prompted me to subscribe claimed the service was \"100 percent safe and secure,\" the terms of service said otherwise: We \"don't guarantee [data] will be safe or secure.\" Cofounder Frank told me the company goes to \"great lengths to make sure that Talkspace is as secure as is presently technologically possible\" and that the service has never had a security breach, but admits, \"no system is impenetrable.\" Patient beware.\n\nI did review Talkspace's privacy policy. The app also collects a ton of data\u2014both personal and treatment information\u2014including all texts between you and the therapist. Frank acknowledged that Talkspace is \"a data-driven platform\" and the company has \"500,000 to learn from.\" This data is regularly shared with advertisers and media, but it is \"de-identified,\" meaning my data\u2014for instance, the medications I take, my diagnosis\u2014are not tied to my name. That's a relief.\n\nBut ultimately my biggest concern had to do with the therapists. Talkspace says in its terms of service that it does \"not guarantee the verification of degrees, qualifications, licensure, certification, credentials, competence or background of any Therapist.\" Wow. That sure didn't help me trust my therapist. I thought I'd signed up for the real deal. Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.\n\nAgain, Frank explained to me that \"there is a bit of confusion here around the legal term guarantee, and what it applies to.\" She said the company goes to \"great lengths\" to verify all that information and that therapists \"must also provide proof of identity, insurance, and pass a background check.\" Could they fabricate these materials? Yes, she says. Could any therapist in any office do the same? Of course.\n\nMy advice: Trust but verify, meaning check your therapist's credentials yourself (as I did, which came out just fine).\n\nAgree or disagree with my advice?

But before P&G gives investors a look at a company with 100 fewer brands, several investing pros caution it will still struggle with old \u2013 and some new \u2013 problems. Since December, half a dozen analysts have either cut their target price, downgraded the stock or both.\n\n\"Cosmetics, household and personal care stocks are no longer en vogue,\" wrote Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman in a report published Monday, who cut her target price for P&G shares to $77 from $86. P&G shares closed Wednesday at $84.93, up 39 cents or 0.46%.\n\nHere's why some analysts aren't big P&G boosters:\n\nP&G expects \"organic sales\" \u2013 those that exclude the impact of foreign exchange, mergers or acquisitions \u2013 to increase a modest 2% this fiscal year. Results for this closely-watched metric got off to a strong start by climbing 3% during the July-to-September quarter. Organic sales rose an anemic 1% in the last two fiscal years.\n\nAnd despite the strength of the U.S. economy in the last few years, nearly two-thirds of P&G sales come from overseas where economic growth is sluggish.\n\nAnalysts say for P&G's stock to continue to move up, the company needs to post steady sales and profit growth.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Jason English is not expecting P&G to match its first quarter sales gains in the second quarter. In a report published earlier this month, English downgraded P&G to a \"sell\" rating from a \"hold\" and cut his target price to $77 from $86.\n\nBillions of dollars are shifting into riskier cyclical industries.\n\nP&G is a \"safety stock,\" a place where investors park their money in uncertain times. P&G was an especially attractive stock because of its 3% dividend yield. But when the investing climate improves, investors often shift their money into faster-growing companies, which creates tremendous downward pressure on stocks like P&G.\n\nConsumer staple stocks, which includes P&G, have declined nearly 2%. Meanwhile, financial and telecomm stocks have jumped by double digits since the election.\n\nIf P&G's earnings remained flat and its stock suddenly reverted to its average valuation over the last decade, it would shave $12 off the stock price.\n\nAnalysts say there's little room for P&G's stock to move up until sales and profits climb, providing more fuel for the share price.\n\n\"In a still relatively rich sector, P&G stands out with its absolute P/E (price-to-earnings) still near a decade high,\" English said.\n\nRising interest rates, furthermore, encourage another class of investor to pull money out of P&G. Nearly zero-percent yields on treasuries and low rates on bonds for more than half a decade have encouraged many investors to put money into stable stocks with solid dividend yields. That maneuver is starting to reverse as rates climb.\n\nMultinational corporations such as P&G have seen their stocks shaken since the election over a potential trade war erupting. In the past month, Trump has prompted some American manufacturers to pare back plans to move factories to Mexico using threats of heavy tariffs on foreign-produced goods.\n\nAnalysts and investors are nervous that future disputes or negotiations could lead to foreign governments retaliating with their own tariffs or other harassment of American businesses.\n\nP&G gets 59% of its business outside the United States. About 8% of its business, or $5.2 billion in sales, comes from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. Eight percent of P&G's sales occur in Latin America.\n\n\"Continued heightened geopolitical uncertainty limit upside and are likely to result in P&G shares remaining rangebound for the next 6-12 months,\" wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan in December.\n\nAstrachan downgraded P&G from a \"buy\" to a \"hold\" rating and cut the target share price from $88 to $86.\n\nThe U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against many foreign currencies. A strong dollar devalues P&G's foreign sales when they are converted back into U.S. currency and that can make the company's products more expensive to overseas consumers. P&G has blamed currency woes with wiping out more $9 billion in sales over the past two years.\n\nPressure from foreign exchange had been lifting this fiscal year. But since the U.S. election, the Mexican peso has dropped 13 percent, the Japanese yen has slipped 10 percent, the euro has slid 4 percent and the British pound has declined 2 percent.\n\nSunTrust analyst William Chappell wrote in late December that much of P&G's turnaround efforts \u2013 savings from the brand divestitures and job cuts \u2013 have been marred by the company's stubborn currency problems.\n\n\"We believe P&G has received little credit for its $10 billion in cost savings program over the past three years because most of the benefits have been masked by adverse FX (foreign exchange),\" Chappell wrote. \"Near term strengthening of the dollar would impair fiscal year 2017 results.\"\n\nChappell lowered his rating on P&G from \"buy\" to \"hold\" and cut his price target for the stock to $85 from $95.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.24299073219299, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 957, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.06105164523, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 7, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118200000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.7763845350052199, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/07/when-smoking-pot-legal-nevada-if-q2-passes/93424860/?hootPostID=c7e92d60dd3727a2790dcbcb7944ece5": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 685, "scraper_regex": 38}}, "headline": "When is smoking pot legal in Nevada if Q2 passes?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 38, "date": "20161108050000", "story_content": "RENO, Nev. \u2014 When can you start smoking (or eating, drinking or vaping) marijuana if Nevada's Question 2 ballot initiative passes?

The kids would play in the alley in the summer, and they seemed to be so happy,\" she said.\n\nVanDyke and her daughter, Brittany Adams, who lives with her, were shocked to learn a member of their quiet neighborhood now stands accused of gunning down five people and injuring six in a baggage claim area of the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\n\nBut Adams said they did notice a change last October.\n\nThat's when Santiago started parking in the driveway space VanDyke's property owner had designated specifically for her because of knee and hip surgeries. She and Adams tried to reason with Santiago to stop taking her space, but he responded \"rather darkly, and with troubling language\" she said. \"Right around New Year's Eve, our next-door neighbor, who lives directly across from them, had to call the police because he was having a loud party and then kicked in his door. He just seemed to have more parties that got out of hand.\"\n\nThe women speculated that Santiago's mood change might be a combination of post-traumatic stress and seasonal affective disorders. Though the amount of darkness varies by location, typically parts of Alaska plunge into longer nights from November through January, and many residents suffer from SAD.\n\n\"Or it could be the PTSD combined with alcohol. We see way too much of that up here,\" said Adams, who has lived in Anchorage her entire life.\n\nShe admits she's worried now for her previously peaceful neighborhood.\n\nShe describes the gentrifying blocks as a place where folks love their kids and walk their dogs and is especially hospitable toward both. She and her mother said children eat wild raspberries off the vines in the summer and play outside all year long, even when temperatures teeter in single digits and snowdrifts reach 5 feet and higher.\n\n\"We need to keep better track of veterans coming back from deployment,\" VanDyke said. \"I know that everyone has a gun in Alaska.

I think there should be a probationary period, say 90 days or so, before someone who's been checked out for mental illness can get their gun back.\"\n\nAdams said their family has lost too many friends and family members to mental illness, alcohol and ultimately suicide. The city and county need to do more, she said.\n\nIn a press conference Saturday, the Anchorage field office of the FBI and the Anchorage Police Department reported that Santiago walked into the local FBI office in November and reported that \"his mind was being controlled by a U.S. intelligence agency.\n\nAppearing agitated and incoherent, he rambled.

The president-elect's current plan to transfer control to his family members does not constitute a divestiture, or even a \"blind trust,\" terminology the real estate billionaire used during his campaign and the standard previous presidents have followed for the past four decades.\n\n\"We're going to push the White House to do what's right,\" said Scott Amey, general counsel for the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight. \"We've said, 'no, you genuinely have to set up a blind trust.'\"\n\nAt least a dozen government oversight groups are meeting daily to figure out how to impress upon Trump the seriousness of an issue that could cast a cloud over much of his domestic and international policy agenda, said Amey. \"We're trying do our research and reach out to the Trump team \u2026 to make sure we're not embroiled in ethics scandals the next few years,\" he said.\n\nEven the conservative editorial page of the Wall Street Journal has called for Trump to sell off his businesses, writing that \"Trump's best option is to liquidate his stake in the company.\"\n\nTrump has scheduled a news conference with his children on Dec. 15, and his surrogates are urging critics and the media to reserve judgment until he shares the specifics of his transfer plan. Yet, in a series of tweets, Trump made no mention of divesting, stating only that \"legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations.\"\n\nHence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016\n\nAt a minimum, Trump needs to publicly identify his overseas projects and consider terminating his so-called branding deals with hotels overseas bearing his name that may pose a security risk, said Richard Painter, a government ethics counsel under former President George W. Bush who is part of the coalition. The group does not have any official power to investigate, which falls to Congress. Yet they're hoping they can make enough noise to get the attention of some Senate Republicans like Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine.\n\n\"There are limits,\" Painter said. \"They're not going to carry his baggage on everything.\"\n\nTrump already bucked tradition by refusing to release his tax returns \u2014 even those that are not under audit \u2014 during the campaign. More recently, he told the New York Times that the law is on his side. In a recent interview with Politico, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said there is no legal requirement for Trump to divest and that he hasn't raised the issue with Trump's transition team.\n\n\"You can't look to Congress to be staunch in its oversight when the same party controls the White House,\" said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization that is part of the coalition. \"Which leaves the media and civil society,\" he said.\n\nTrump ran his anti-establishment campaign on a pledge to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington, and he was especially scornful of public officials who may leverage their government positions of authority for personal profit. The real estate billionaire and reality television star made Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's family charity, which accepts foreign donations, a flash point, accusing her of \"pay-to-play\" machine politics. Unlike Clinton and her charity, Trump draws a direct paycheck from money that flows from foreign companies and patrons of his real estate empire.\n\nTrump's business entanglements have already created perceptions of impropriety.\n\nOn the first weekend after his upset over Clinton, Trump pressed British politician Nigel Farage to lobby against wind farms, which Trump has long fought against building near his Scottish golf courses. Days later, Trump tweeted an endorsement of Farage as a potential British ambassador to the United States.\n\nIt's just a sampling of what's to come absent a stronger corporate firewall, warn ethics lawyers.\n\n\"Unless he divests ownership, he will have an interest in the foreign government payments and benefits that flow to his businesses daily,\" Norm Eisen, a former ethics lawyer under Obama, and Painter wrote in a Nov. 30 letter. \"That creates such a serious conflict of interest that the framers of the Constitution prohibited it for the president in the emoluments clause,\" the two said.\n\nEmoluments Clause\n\nAt issue is the Emoluments Clause to the U.S. Constitution, which states: \"no Person holding any Office\u2026shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument\u2026from any King, Prince, or foreign state.\" The point is to avoid bribes and conflicts of interest.\n\nThat extends to foreign diplomats staying at Trump hotels, including parties similar to the Bahrain event, loans from the Bank of China, and rent paid by foreign governments, according to Painter. \"It is too easy a way of paying off the president,\" he said. \"Obama would have been impeached in two weeks if he had started this while in the White House.\"\n\nIt's probable that Trump hadn't mapped out the mechanics of separating himself from his sprawling business, especially since even many in his inner circle were caught by surprise by the election's outcome. And real estate can be particularly difficult to offload as much of it might have to be liquidated.\n\nRudy Giuliani, a top adviser to Trump, has said it would be \"unrealistic\" for Trump to follow the example of previous presidents and lamented that it would \"basically put his children out of work.\"\n\nYet the federal government's Office of Government Ethics spent Wednesday trying to box Trump in on the divestiture issue, confirming it had advised Trump officials to pursue such a course. \"We can't repeat enough how good this total divestiture will be,\" read one of a number of tweets.\n\nIn addition, the outside groups anticipate potentially unprecedented collaboration with other issue-oriented groups, ranging from food safety to national security based on some of Trump's Cabinet picks and transition leaders.\n\nAccording to a new report by Public Citizen, out of the 75 landing team members announced by the Trump transition, 70% have some corporate affiliation or work for corporate-backed think tanks. Trump is a \"candidate who ran under an anti-corruption banner, as someone who is going to remove insiders who is now turning over the inner workings of government to a corporate class,\" said Weissman.\n\nMaryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, has written a number of letters flagging issues including Trump's conflicts of interest as well as interference in the 2016 election by the Russian government that's been documented by the U.S. intelligence community. They've received no response from Chaffetz's office.\n\nThe most recent letter points out that Trump will soon be in violation of his lease with the federal government to redevelop and run his Washington hotel in the Old Post Office building. The lease states that no elected official \"shall be admitted to any share or part of this lease.\"\n\nEven conservative watchdogs are suggesting the conflicts-of-interest issue may compound for Trump. \"Anti-corruption aficionados across the political spectrum are mesmerized by the spectacle of Mr. Trump's vast business empire on a collision course with the presidency,\" said Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group. \"How Mr. Trump resolves the issue will send up an important signal about the nature of the Trump Presidency.\"\n\nOversight and government ethics groups have gotten no response to their concerns since Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over Trump's transition effort, Amey said. \"There hasn't been any circling back to our community as shareholders that might help them,\" said Amey, who compared the reception to the significant counsel his group provided to President Obama's team.\n\n\"It seems as if so far he thinks he has all the solutions by setting up a trust and handing it over to his children,\" which is \"disappointing,\" Amey said. \"We thought at least here's an outsider who's going to do things a bit differently,\" he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.71668815612793, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1409, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.395130954530001, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 7, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 47, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161201200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 10, "pct_mft_words": 3.33569907735983, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2016/11/17/judge-orders-nick-gordon-pay-36-million-bobbi-kristinas-family/94041640/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Judge orders Nick Gordon to pay $36 million to Bobbi Kristina's family", "wordcount_as_scraped": 760, "date": "20161118000000", "story_content": "ATLANTA \u2014 After months of ignoring a civil lawsuit filed against him by Bobbi Kristina Brown's family, her ex-boyfriend Nick Gordon was ordered Thursday by a Fulton County judge to pay the family $36 million for her wrongful death.\n\nIn September, Gordon was deemed \"legally responsible\" for Bobbi Kristina's death after he failed to appear in court.\n\nBobbi Kristina, the daughter of the late Whitney Houston and singer Bobby Brown, died in July 2015, six months after she was found unresponsive face down in a bath tub at her suburban Atlanta townhouse in January 2015. She was 22.\n\nHer death was eerily similar to the way her mother died three years earlier, and drew worldwide headlines and frenzied attention of the tabloids. She is buried at a cemetery in New Jersey next to her mother.\n\nBobbi Kristina never regained consciousness to explain what had happened to her. Gordon, who also lived in the townhouse, was among the people listed on the police report as being in the home when investigators arrived there.\n\nHer family, both the Houston relatives and later the Brown relatives, and the court-appointed conservator for her estate filed a civil suit accusing Gordon of playing a role in her death by giving her a \"toxic cocktail.\" The lawsuit accused him of assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and transferring money from Brown's account into his own without authorization as causes.\n\nFulton County Superior Court Judge T. Jackson Bedford ruled that because Gordon failed to appear twice to answer the suit, anything alleged by the plaintiffs was admitted through omission. The lawsuit sought $50 million in damages.\n\nFollowing the series of testimonials from Bobby Brown, and friends of Bobbi Kristina Thursday , Bedford assessed the damages and losses related to the January incident to determine the value of Bobbi Kristina's life.\n\n\"To determine the value of a life is pretty difficult. So the court has been back there primarily struggling with that particular issue,\" Bedford said.\n\nThe judge awarded more than $36 million, broken down as:\n\nDavid Ware, who represented the Brown estate along with Glenda Hatchett, issued a statement saying there was an \"urgent need to get justice for Bobbi Kristina Brown.\"\n\n\"We intend to pursue, with all vigor, the full collection of the judgment,\" Ware said in the statement. \"The defendant will not escape justice nor ever profit from his misdeeds. We hope that in some small way this will allow Krissy's family to continue their quest for peace.\"\n\n\"Domestic violence is a horrible reality in our society and Bobbi suffered such horrific pain and degradation at the hands of Nick Gordon, the man she loved and trusted,\" Hatchett added. \"No one should suffer the way she did and the judge sent a strong message in the award of punitive damages that this despicable behavior is inexcusable and will not be tolerated.\"\n\nBobby Brown and his oldest daughter, La'Princia Brown, Bobbi Kristina's half-sister, were among the emotional witnesses who testified at Thursday's hearing.\n\n\"I just miss her,\" said La'Princia, recalling one of the final moments she saw her sister in hospice care. \"I played music to her a lot. I could see her eyes looking around the room. She would cough. She would yawn. It didn't seem right that she couldn't communicate. She'd blink and more tears could come. I feel like she could see me but couldn't say anything.\"\n\nGordon wasn't in court Thursday and did not have an attorney in the civil case, but his criminal defense attorneys, Joe Habachy and Jose Baez, had said in August 2015 that the allegations were baseless. They also said that Gordon is \"heartbroken\" and called the suit a \"fictitious assault.\"\n\nAutopsy results released in March 2016 indicated multiple drugs were involved in Brown's death by drowning, including marijuana, alcohol (ethanol), benzoylecgonine (a cocaine-related substance), benzodiazepines (medications used for sedation or to treat anxiety) and morphine. But the medical examiner couldn't determine if she killed herself, if someone else killed her or if her death was accidental.\n\nEarlier this year, Gordon talked about the death on Dr. Phil show. After that interview aired, Bobby Brown joined the wrongful death lawsuit against Gordon.\n\nAlthough the police and district attorney's office have been investigating Bobbi Kristina's death since January 2015, no one, including Gordon, has been charged with a crime.\n\nDontaye Carter, a spokesman for Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard, said in an email Thursday that Brown's death is still under investigation.\n\nGordon has been living in Florida close to his mother and almost certainly does not have $36 million.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.756207466125491, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 777, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.92608671626, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161118000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 7, "pct_mft_words": 3.8610038610038595, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/05/repeat-child-rapist-could-face-life-sentence-alleged-assault-teen/96190648/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Repeat child rapist could face life sentence for alleged assault of teen", "wordcount_as_scraped": 798, "date": "20170105130000", "story_content": "ST. CLOUD, Minn. --- Stearns County is considering calling a grand jury to seek an indictment against a repeat sex offender who was arrested last week and accused of raping a 14-year-old girl in Waite Park.\n\nThe indictment would allow prosecutors to seek a life sentence for John William Magney, 56, who previously was convicted of sexually assaulting two girls \u2014 a 4-year-old in the early 1980s in Mille Lacs County and a 6-year-old in the mid-1990s in Benton County.\n\nMagney recently was charged with first- and third-degree criminal sexual conduct, accused of assaulting the girl early Dec. 17 at a Waite Park residence.\n\n\"It appears with his past record that he may qualify for the life sentence, which requires calling a grand jury,\" said Stearns County Attorney Janelle Kendall. \"We're looking at that right now.\"\n\nA court complaint charging Magney indicates that he provided the girl with a drink while she was watching a movie. The girl felt dizzy after drinking from it. Magney is accused of undressing the girl and forcing intercourse on her.\n\nA witness walked in on the assault in progress, according to the complaint, and Magney left the residence. The witness told investigators that the girl appeared to be struggling to get up and put her clothes back on. The witness had to help the girl get dressed.\n\nThe girl was taken to the hospital where doctors noticed bruises on her wrist and back and injuries consistent with a rape, according to the complaint.\n\nMagney remains in Stearns County Jail in lieu of $1 million bail.\n\nThe county has used a 2005 law change once before to seek an indictment in a sexual assault case. That law provided for life sentences in certain sexual assault cases, but required a grand jury indictment rather than a charging decision from a county attorney's office.\n\nIn that previous case, a then 22-year-old man was indicted after he raped, beat and tortured a woman in August 2011 in south St. Cloud, then had to be rescued from the Mississippi River after jumping in.\n\nJames David Bryson was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and admitting causing injuries that a judge described as \"brutal and barbaric.\"\n\nThe state attorney general's office in 2010 filed a petition to commit Magney indefinitely to the Minnesota Sex Offender Program based on his sex offenses against the two young girls and a bestiality charge to which Magney pleaded guilty in 2008.\n\nThat petition was dismissed after three experts who examined Magney, or his records, gave opinions that he didn't meet the criteria for commitment.\n\nThe first doctor who evaluated Magney, Dr. Peter Marston, recommended commitment for Magney as a sexually dangerous person but not as a sexual psychopathic personality. His recommendation, which was based only on a review of records, included a belief that Magney be designated a Level 2 sex offender, not the higher Level 3 offender.\n\nThat assessment caused the Attorney General's Office to file the petition seeking to commit Magney. The next step in that process is to have the court appoint an examiner to assess the subject of the commitment.\n\nThe court-appointed psychologist who examined Magney, Dr. Amanda Powers-Sawyer, interviewed him for more than three hours, reviewed the documents that Marston had reviewed and read updated treatment records that showed that Magney had completed sex offender treatment while in custody.\n\nPowers-Sawyer determined that Magney didn't meet the commitment criteria.\n\nStearns County then asked Marston to review Powers-Sawyer's report and the updated treatment records. Marston then changed his opinion and said that he wouldn't recommend committing Magney as a sexually dangerous person.\n\nThe county and attorney general's office then sought a third opinion, something that doesn't happen frequently in commitment cases.\n\nMagney's criminal record was the reason the county \"went the extra mile to get the third examiner,\" Kendall said. \"We certainly did everything that we possibly could in 2011 to go down this path.\"\n\nDr. James Alsdurf reviewed the cases and the opinions of Marston and Powers-Sawyer. He found that Magney's completion of sex offender treatment was the \"primary justification\" for his determination that Magney did not meet the criteria for civil commitment.\n\nThe law requires having at least one examiner recommending commitment in order to proceed with such a petition. With none of the three doctors recommending commitment, the county had to dismiss the petition.\n\nMagney was released from prison in 2011 but was sent back after failing to comply with predatory offender registration requirements in Freeborn County. He was a Level 2 sex offender at the time of his arrest.\n\nHad he been classified as a Level 3, those deemed most likely to re-offend, the community would have been notified of his past convictions and his current address.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.30270910263062, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 772, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 8, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.29788311768, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.10880829015544, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/17/ashlynne-mike-father-suing-navajo-tribe/96697700/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 844, "scraper_regex": 733}}, "headline": "Father of slain 11-year-old Navajo girl sues tribe", "wordcount_as_scraped": 733, "date": "20170118030000", "story_content": "WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. \u2014 The father of a slain 11-year-old Navajo girl is suing the tribe for failing to have an emergency notification system in place that he claims would have saved his daughter's life.\n\nAshlynne Mike's father, Gary Mike, has filed a civil complaint against the tribe and its Division of Public Safety and Department of Law Enforcement. The complaint does not include a request for compensation, and it demands a jury trial.\n\nThe complaint also names Navajo Nation police Capt. Ivan Tsosie, who oversaw the Shiprock police department when Ashlynne was kidnapped on May 2, along with her brother, Ian Mike, while they were walking home from school in San Juan Chapter.\n\nThe complaint accuses Tsosie of mishandling the investigation. Tsosie could not be reached for comment Tuesday. \u200b\n\nAshlynne was found dead May 3, about 6 miles south of the Shiprock pinnacle. Tom Begaye Jr., of Waterflow, has been charged in connection to her kidnapping and murder.\n\nGary Mike filed a missing person report for his daughter at 6:53 p.m. MT May 2, and the FBI was not notified until 9 p.m., the complaint states. A search was not initiated until after 2 a.m. May 3 and an Amber Alert was issued at 2:30 a.m.\n\nAshlynne was found dead at about 11:30 a.m. May 3.\n\nBegaye, who was arrested the same day Ashlynne's body was found, told police the girl was still moving when he left her bleeding in the desert, according to the criminal complaint against him. He pleaded not guilty to murder, sexual abuse and other charges in June in federal court.\n\n\"If a concentrated search had been begun immediately upon the making of the report, it would have saved her life. \u2026The entire investigation and search was mishandled, and the Navajo Nation's own failings directly contributed to Ashlynne's death,\" the complaint states.\n\nThe complaint, which was filed last month in Shiprock District Court, says the tribe had \"numerous opportunities\" to develop an emergency notification system by using two federal grants.\n\nThe grants from the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 $330,000 in 2007 and $357,000 in 2011 \u2014 were intended for programs that might have made a difference, according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint states the 2007 grant, reportedly intended to help the tribe create an Amber Alert system, was used for other projects and items and for employee bonuses for the Department of Law Enforcement and Division of Public Safety. About $179,651 of the amount awarded in 2007 was not spent and was returned to the Justice Department.\n\nThe tribe's Division of Public Safety received a federal grant for $357,000 in 2011 to implement sex offender registration and notification programs, according to information on the Justice Department's website.\n\nThe grant was awarded to help the tribe upgrade its fingerprint identification system to share information with national databases and \"enhance information technology resources\" by buying computers, hard drives and scanners.\n\nThe complaint states \"all of these funds were misused and the system was never put in place.\"\n\n\"We don't know why the previous administration didn't pursue establishing such a system on the Navajo Nation,\" the president said in the statement. \"However, we are thankful that we now have a system in place.\"\n\nShortly after Ashlynne's death, Begaye created a task force to implement an emergency notification system on the reservation.\n\nA press release from the president's office last week stated the tribe had made progress on the system. Tribal officials said the system should be fully functional within a couple of weeks and training for law enforcement was expected to start this month.\n\n\"Since the death of our daughter, the Navajo Nation has worked diligently to establish an Amber Alert and 911 system,\" the president said in the statement. \"The Amber Alert is in effect and has been utilized a few times since implementation in the protection of our children.\"\n\nAttorney David Jordan, who is representing Gary Mike and his family, said today that his clients want to \"vindicate\" Ashlynne's life by having the Navajo Nation acknowledge its wrongdoing.\n\n\"They filed the complaint to get some justice for their daughter. The Navajo Nation had all the means and ability to put in place a structure that would have saved her life and they funneled that money away in kind of a shameless way,\" Jordan said.\n\nHe added the family did not file the lawsuit to gain publicity but \"because they want justice.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.84842324256897, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 844, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.10064005058, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.265402843601899, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/11/27/castro-cuba-chavez-venezuela-socialism-glenn-reynolds/94485906/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e1": [472]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 676, "scraper_regex": 635}}, "headline": "Castro, Chavez, and 'bad luck': Glenn Reynolds", "wordcount_as_scraped": 635, "date": "20161127150000", "story_content": "Robert Heinlein once wrote:\n\nI thought about this statement this weekend, reading two news stories.

Many are even taking to boats, echoing, as the Times notes, \"an image so symbolic of the perilous journeys to escape Cuba or Haiti \u2014 but not oil-rich Venezuela.\"\n\nWell, Venezuela was once rich. But mismanagement and kleptocracy can make any country poor and Venezuela \u2014 as is typical with countries whose leaders promise to soak the rich for the benefit of the poor \u2014 has had plenty of both. And now, though Hugo Chavez's family has grown fabulously wealthy, the poor have nothing. As one refugee quoted in the Times article says, \"I'm leaving with nothing. But I have to do this. Otherwise, we will just die here hungry.\"\n\nUnder capitalism, the rich grow powerful. Under socialism, the powerful grow rich \u2014 and everyone else grows poor.\n\nWhich brings me to the other story, the death of Cuban dictator-for-life Fidel Castro. Although many among Western political and entertainment elites still think of Fidel Castro fondly, such people are, at best, what Lenin called \"useful idiots.\" In fact, as Yale professor Carlos Eire notes in The Washington Post, Castro was not a benevolent patron of the poor, but a \"brutal Big Brother\" who crushed dissent, tortured, imprisoned and executed his critics, and stole everything he cared to steal from his island's inhabitants. He lived the lifestyle of an emperor, while his people were subjected to poverty. He persecuted gay people and Christians, and exported war and terror.\n\nOh, he said things about equality and justice, but those were lies. In his country, as in socialist dictatorships everywhere, there were two sets of rules: Those for the connected elite, and those for the subjects. They talk about equality, but what they set up turns out to be an awful lot like a monarchy.\n\nBoth Venezuela and Cuba have suffered under leaders who enriched themselves and their families. Chavez's daughter is the richest person in Venezuela, with a net worth in the billions, while in true \"socialist equality\" fashion, Cuba is now run by Castro's brother, Raul.\n\nYet their poverty and oppression are treated as if they're just \"bad luck.\" But it's only bad luck in the Heinlein sense. As Heinlein also said, a good cook can take wholesome ingredients and produce something much more valuable. A bad cook, on the other hand, can take those same ingredients \u2014 valuable in themselves \u2014 and produce an inedible mess.\n\nSocialist kleptocrats are like Heinlein's bad cook, with the added trait of stealing any edible leftovers for themselves and their kin. Perhaps the world will learn a valuable lesson from the fates of Cuba and Venezuela, and avoid such \"bad luck\" in the future.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

Mexico's refusal to pay for the construction, a condition that was central to Trump's campaign, has raised new questions about how the multibillion-dollar project ultimately will be financed. It also prompted the first diplomatic crisis of the new administration when Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Thursday canceled an upcoming visit with the new American president.\n\n\"Regardless of who pays for it, building a wall on the border is likely going to put U.S. citizens and their property on the (Mexican) side of this thing,'' Martinez said, indicating that significant pieces of land on the U.S. side of the border will be needed for construction. \"You can't just build on top of the Rio Grande River (the natural border between large swaths of Texas and Mexico). That is not a solution.''\n\nMore agents \n\nMartinez said more effective border security is better achieved with the deployment of additional federal agents and surveillance technology. The president also has called for the hiring of 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\nTony Estrada, the longtime sheriff of Santa Cruz County, Ariz., whose Nogales office sits two miles from Mexico, said the fortification of physical barriers along the border have only served to intensify the Mexican cartels' drug and human trafficking efforts.\n\nAfter President George W. Bush fenced hundreds of miles of the border as part of his own border enforcement effort, Estrada said drug cartels increasingly expanded their illicit portfolios to include human trafficking.\n\n\"The wall is no silver bullet,'' Estrada said. \"A wall has never stopped anybody, and it's not going to stop desperate people who are seeking a better life. It is an illusion. People will find a way, they always have.''\n\nEstrada also is no fan of Trump.\n\nBorn in Mexico, Estrada, 73, said Trump's strident campaign rhetoric aimed at Mexican immigrants represented a personal affront to him and the broader immigrant community on the border.\n\n\"Donald Trump has every bit of personal wealth in the world,'' Estrada said. \"How can he possibly relate to the people here.''\n\nThe proposed wall, Estrada said, may \"sound good to people who are not from here.''\n\n\"It divides people; it divides cultures; it divides economies,'' he said. \"I've never seen a beautiful wall.''\n\nThe border sheriffs', however, do not speak for all of law enforcement.\n\nDivisions among law enforcement\n\nNathan Catura, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association whose group represents more than 25,000 active and retired federal officers, said Friday that the wall was a necessary component of Trump's border security plan.\n\n\"FLEOA is not unsympathetic to the plight facing those who desire to emigrate to the United States,'' Catura said. \"But we are committed first to protecting the American citizenry and the unwavering rule of law.''\n\nWhile the public debate aired stark differences over the effectiveness and financing of the proposed wall, the Senate Homeland Security Committee has scheduled a hearing next week to examine \"lessons learned'' from the past border fencing effort.\n\nFormer Department of Homeland Security officials, including David Aguilar who served as acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner, are slated to testify Feb. 1.\n\nLess than a week later, Martinez and some of his local law enforcement colleagues are slated to air their own concerns before a House committee where the wall proposal is expected to figure prominently.\n\n\"A wall is easier said then done,'' Martinez said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.57068061828613, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 701, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.3327823236, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.27960057061341, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/01/20/social-media-trump-inauguration/96832122/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 789, "scraper_regex": 930}}, "headline": "Trump protesters vow social media blackout during inauguration", "wordcount_as_scraped": 930, "date": "20170120180000", "story_content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the swearing in, some people swore off social media.\n\nChristine Schultz and her family shut off the television and their social media accounts to protest the inauguration of President Donald Trump.

Already, half of the states permit some form of medical marijuana use, and more than half of all Americans live in a state that has approved medical marijuana. Four states \u2014 Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Alaska, plus the District of Columbia \u2014 have already legalized recreational marijuana\n\nToday, voters in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada are considering legalizing recreational marijuana. Voters in Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota are asking voters whether to permit medical use for certain conditions, like cancer or chronic pain. None of those votes will change the federal ban on marijuana use, although legalization advocates say it may further pressure Congress, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FDA to act.\n\nLawmakers see marijuana taxes as a source of new revenue to close budget gaps, while entrepreneurs are considering the business case, with potentially billions of dollars in profits possible from this fast-growing Made-In-America industry.\n\nHere's a quick guide to the measures, listed first by recreational and then by medical.\n\nRecreational marijuana proposals\n\nThe California plan, known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act or Prop. 64, allows residents to grow up to six plants at home and gives municipalities the power to allow or ban outdoor grows and marijuana stores. It requires commercial growers to comply with environmental regulations \u2014 many illegal growers today ignore laws governing water, pesticide and fertilizer use \u2014 and gives existing medical-marijuana providers a head start in getting business licenses. The measure also maintains existing prohibitions on youth use and driving while high. Critics worry it will open up television advertising to marijuana companies and goes too far in permitting people previously convicted of violent drug offenses to join the industry. Medical marijuana is widely available in California.\n\nProp. 205 would legalize adult recreational marijuana use, cultivation and sales, with a 15% sales tax to fund new state regulation, enforcement and education efforts. Medical marijuana is legal already in Arizona, and the recreational plan backed by the group \"Campaign to Regulate Marijuana like Alcohol\" expands use to adults 21 and older. The proposal would allow people to possess up to an ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants, and creates a state-regulated system of commercial growers and retailers.\n\nThe ballot measure expands the state's well-regarded medical marijuana program to recreational use, but it also permits the creation of \"marijuana social clubs,\" where people would be able to consume marijuana. Critics worry that Question 1 might increase the amount of impaired driving, in the way that bars can lead to more drunken drivers on the road.\n\nThere's also concern that the measure requires marijuana-focused publications to be sold from behind store counters, a proposal that was struck down as unconstitutional in Colorado. Gov. Paul LePage signed Maine's medical marijuana law in 2011, but he opposes this recreational legalization effort. The plan lets adults possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana, along with growing up to six adult plants at a time, with exemptions for seedlings and smaller plants. Commercial sales would be taxed and regulated by the state.\n\nQuestion 4 allows adults to grow up to six plants, possess 10 ounces of marijuana at home, and posses up to an ounce in public, although public consumption remains illegal. Gov. Charlie Baker argues legalizing marijuana in the Bay State could increase youth use and distract regulators and public health officials wrestling with an epidemic of opioid abuse and overdoses. If approved, the measure creates a new Cannabis Control Commission, which would oversee regulations and taxing of commercial sales.\n\nQuestion 2 permits the personal possession of one ounce or less of marijuana or one-eighth of an ounce or less of concentrated marijuana for individuals 21 years of age or older. Adults 21 and older could grow up to six plants for personal use if they live more than 25 miles away from a commercial marijuana store, but otherwise would be required to buy taxed and regulated cannabis. Nevada's program would be open to anyone visiting the state, and supporters say the tourist-heavy market could be worth $390 million, with up to $1.1 billion in economic impact. Medical dispensaries would be granted an 18-month monopoly on recreational sales, and alcohol distributors would also have an 18-month monopoly on distribution.\n\nMedical marijuana proposals\n\nThe Arkansas Medical Marijuana Amendment of 2016 legalizes medical use for certain specified conditions, including cancer, glaucoma and fibromyalgia, and requires a doctor's recommendation. The law would permit at least 20 and up to 40 medical marijuana dispensaries, although cities and towns could ban them if they want. Taxes paid by buyers would fund regulation of the medical marijuana industry, and home-growing would remain illegal \u2014 all marijuana would have to be grown at a state-licensed cultivation facility.\n\nAmendment 2 permits the use of medical cannabis for specific conditions, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, and multiple sclerosis. A similar measure won a majority of support from voters in 2014, but Florida requires a \"supermajority\" to pass proposals like this. This proposal can only pass if it gets 60% or more support from voters. It would create a system of medical marijuana cultivation centers and caregivers, and use requires a doctor's recommendation.\n\nMontana's voters approved medical marijuana in 2004, but the state legislature changed the law to significantly curtail it. The new plan, Initiative 182, allows doctors to recommend marijuana use for specific conditions, including chronic pain or PTSD. Also known as the Montana Medical Marijuana Act, the plan permits the creation of medical marijuana cultivation facilities and bans law enforcement from conducting surprise inspections of them.\n\nInitiated Statutory Measure 5 permits the use of medical marijuana for specific conditions including cancer, HIV/AIDS and glaucoma, and would be overseen by state health regulators. People living more than 40 miles from a state-registered medical marijuana cultivation facility would be permitted to grow their own, and patients could have up to three ounces at a time.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.8469656705856299, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 971, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.52324043183, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161108200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 2.6776519052523198, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/26/baby-box-new-jersey/97110188/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Why New Jersey is encouraging moms to put their newborns in a box", "wordcount_as_scraped": 621, "date": "20170127010000", "story_content": "CAMDEN, N.J. \u2014 A statewide safe-sleeping campaign featuring free cardboard \"Baby Boxes\" rolled out Thursday at Cooper University Hospital, part of the newest effort to reduce the number of infants dying from Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Syndrome (or SUIDS).\n\nNew Jersey is the first state where all expecting and new parents can receive mattress-lined boxes and infant care supplies from The Baby Box Co. after completing an online parenting education program through its website, babyboxuniversity.com.\n\nFinland introduced baby boxes, along with prenatal care and parenting education, as a way to decrease its infant mortality rate, from 65 deaths per 1,000 births in 1938, to 1.3 deaths per 1,000 births in 2013, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThat country's work inspired Jennifer Clary and Michelle Vick to launch The Baby Box Co. in the United States. According to its website, Baby Boxes serve families in 52 countries.\n\n\"I think we have a very special product, but it's only special because of the way we distribute it,\" Clary, the CEO, said. \"Early parenting education is linked to infant mortality reduction. That's what we focus on.\"\n\nThe New Jersey program expects to distribute about 105,000 boxes this year. In South Jersey, the boxes will be distributed by Cooper University Health Care and Southern New Jersey Perinatal Cooperative, among others. Parents also can choose to have the box delivered to their home.\n\nMade from sturdy cardboard, the boxes can be used as a bed for the baby until 5 or 6 months of age. The supplies include diapers, wipes, a onesie, breastfeeding supplies and other items, valued at $150.\n\nThe program was introduced by New Jersey's Child Fatality & Near Fatality Review Board, using a grant from the Centers for Disease Control. The review board examines deaths and near-deaths of children to identify causes and ways to prevent future deaths.\n\nWhile unsafe sleeping practices don't account for every case of SUIDS, parental education can help eliminate preventable deaths, said Dr. Kathryn McCans, an emergency department physician at Cooper who also leads the review board.\n\n\"Unsafe sleep is a significant cause of SUIDS in our state and likely in every state,\" McCans said. \"Based on national data, New Jersey fares pretty well, as far as the rate of SUIDS death, but our rate is still high enough that it results in 50 to 60 deaths a year that seem to have at least unsafe sleep associated with it, even if it wasn't the full cause.\"\n\nFactors associated with safer sleep include a firm mattress and a bare crib with no blankets, pillows, bumpers or stuffed animals in it; no smoking or substance use during or after pregnancy or by anyone in the household; exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life or any amount of breastfeeding possible.\n\n\"This program, at its core, is about getting education out to parents in a form that younger parents really love,\" McCans said.\n\nCooper doctors and health experts in New Jersey helped the company create educational videos for expectant parents on topics like installing car seats, safe sleeping practices, breastfeeding resources and support, and fatherhood engagement.\n\nTwo Camden families were the first to receive their boxes Thursday. Dolores Peterson popped her 5-week-old daughter into a cardboard box lined with a mattress, as cameras recorded little Ariabella Espada's reaction.\n\nPeterson, a first-time mother, said she plans to tell her mothers group about the program.\n\n\"I'm going to let every mother know to sign up and get a box,\" Peterson said, so their babies can sleep safely, too.\n\nTo receive a free box, New Jersey parents can register for free online at babyboxuniversity.com.

These communities and many others know the social, economic and artistic benefits that come from having an orchestra call it \"home.\" Three orchestras out of commission, even if for a very short while as in Philadelphia, serves notice of the challenges these institutions just cannot seem to shake.\n\nAmerica's orchestras have been caught in a changing landscape for several decades now. Ever tightening finances, audiences that are aging and lack diversity, the \"dead white man's thing\" rap, all are relevant in the ongoing saga. Some of our orchestras have not survived or, after bankruptcy or a shutdown, are now shadows of what they once were. New Orleans, Denver, Honolulu, San Jose, Syracuse, the New York City Opera \u2014 the list is long and sobering.\n\n\"American exceptionalism\" during the 20th century included the standing and stature of our symphony orchestras. By the mid-20th century, America's orchestras, and in particular the Big Five \u2014 Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York and Philadelphia \u2014 were the envy of the world. Their virtuosity and sound set them apart from all but the finest of the world's orchestras, and led internationally renowned composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Paul Hindemith and Sergei Rachmaninoff to compose with them specifically in mind.\n\nTaking American orchestra \"exceptionalism\" further into the 21st century now requires a complete rethinking of the role our federal government plays in providing financial support for these institutions. To date, such funding has come through our National Endowment for the Arts, which receives approximately $150 million a year for federal arts spending. In 2013, Germany spent 40 times what we did per capita to support the arts.\n\nIt might seem strange to say this, but it's true: A weaker Pittsburgh Symphony or weaker Philadelphia Orchestra means a weaker America. Other governments, including allies such as France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, view the stability and standing of their finest orchestras as a measure of their place in the world. Likewise, our orchestras are icons of our society and cultural ambassadors for our nation. And they are in need of our collective assistance.\n\nThere is of course the argument that arts in America have always been financed differently than in other parts of the world \u2014 through private philanthropy rather than government support. It is a tired argument, though, and truth be told, it's not working for our orchestras except in a few places in the country. Funding methods from abroad could be adopted, such as the national arts lotteries that exist in the U.K. and the Netherlands. There are also approaches that could be modeled on how we now fund some of our environmental infrastructure, such as establishing a national revolving loan fund providing assistance to financially distressed arts organizations.\n\nUltimately, we have to prioritize how we spend our limited federal dollars. What does it say about us that our federal government spent $245 billion bailing out financial institutions that were \"too big to fail,\" but it will not consider meaningful support for our magnificent but financially distressed symphony orchestra institutions? Our next president has a huge opportunity to help write the story of America's orchestras, and the arts in general, in a way that has not happened since the Kennedy administration.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.25944578647614, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 654, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.373642438589999, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161116170000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.6697247706422003, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/11/05/melania-trump-work-visa-model-immigration/93335056/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1227, "scraper_regex": 1300}}, "headline": "Report: Melania Trump modeled in U.S. before obtaining work visa ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1300, "date": "20161105060000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Melania Trump was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States worth $20,056 that occurred in the seven weeks before she had legal permission to work in the country, according to detailed accounting ledgers, contracts and related documents from 20 years ago provided to The Associated Press.\n\nThe details of Mrs. Trump's early paid modeling work in the U.S. emerged in the final days of a bitter presidential campaign in which her husband, Donald Trump, has taken a hard line on immigration laws and those who violate them. Trump has proposed broader use of the government's E-verify system allowing employers to check whether job applicants are authorized to work. He has noted that federal law prohibits illegally paying immigrants.\n\nMrs. Trump, who received a green card in March 2001 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006, has always maintained that she arrived in the country legally and never violated the terms of her immigration status. During the presidential campaign, she has cited her story to defend her husband's hard line on immigration.\n\nThe wife of the GOP presidential nominee, who sometimes worked as a model under just her first name, has said through an attorney that she first came to the U.S. from Slovenia on Aug. 27, 1996, on a B1/B2 visitor visa and then obtained an H-1B work visa on Oct. 18, 1996.\n\nThe documents obtained by the AP show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15, during a time when her visa allowed her generally to be in the U.S. and look for work but not perform paid work in the country. The documents examined by the AP indicate that the modeling assignments would have been outside the bounds of her visa.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that the discovery will affect the citizenship status of Mrs. Trump. The government can seek to revoke the U.S. citizenship of immigrants after the fact in cases when it determines a person willfully misrepresented or concealed facts relevant to his naturalization. But the government effectively does this in only the most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes.\n\nThe disclosures about the payments come as Mrs. Trump takes on a more substantial role advocating for her husband's candidacy. She made her first speech in months Thursday, in which she spoke of her time working as a model in Europe and her decision to come to the U.S.\n\n\"As a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here,\" she said. \"Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American.\"\n\nThe documents obtained by the AP included ledgers, other accounting documents and a management agreement signed by Mrs. Trump from Metropolitan International Management that covered parts of 1996 and 1997. The AP obtained the files this week after seeking copies since August from employees of the now-defunct modeling firm, after Mrs. Trump made comments earlier this summer that appeared inconsistent with U.S. immigration rules.\n\nA New York immigration lawyer whom Mrs. Trump asked to review her immigration documents, Michael J. Wildes, also reviewed some of the ledgers at AP's request. Wildes said in a brief statement that \"these documents, which have not been verified, do not reflect our records including corresponding passport stamps.\" He did not elaborate or answer additional questions asking for clarification. Wilde appeared to be referring to Mrs. Trump's arrival in the United States on Aug. 27, 1996, one day after the ledgers list a charge for car service to pick up Mrs. Trump from the airport. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks also did not answer additional written questions from the AP.\n\nSince questions arose earlier this year, Mrs. Trump has declined to publicly release her immigration records. Wildes, the immigration lawyer, released a letter in September that laid out the details of what he said Mrs. Trump's immigration records show, including a seven-week window in which Mrs. Trump was in the U.S. before her work visa was issued.\n\nDuring that seven-week period, the ledgers list modeling work for clients that included Fitness magazine and Bergdorf Goodman department store. The management agreement, which said it was not an employment agreement, included a handwritten date of Aug. 27, 1996. The top of the document said it was \"made and entered into as of this 4th day of September 1996.\"\n\nMany of the documents were part of a legal dispute related to the dissolution of the firm in the late 1990s and found recently in storage. The accounting ledgers for the firm's models were listed on hundreds of pages of continuously fed paper that appeared yellowed with age. They were authenticated by a former employee who worked at the firm at the time. The employee spoke on condition of anonymity because this person feared retaliation and threats from Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nExhibit markings with the records were also consistent with documents filed in New York state court, including a deposition of one former partner that referred to the same exhibit number. The sworn testimony describing the exhibit's content matches the documents obtained by the AP.\n\nA former partner, Paolo Zampolli, who previously told the AP that he recruited Mrs. Trump to come to the U.S. as a model, confirmed that the contract language was used by his firm and his signature appeared on the document. Mrs. Trump's signature on the contract resembled her signature on her marriage license recorded in 2005. Asked about the two dates on the document, Zampolli said he usually vacationed in Europe each August and likely arranged for the contract to be formally executed when he returned to New York after Labor Day, even though Mrs. Trump had signed it eight days earlier.\n\nZampolli previously told the AP that Mrs. Trump obtained a work visa before she modeled professionally in the United States. He said the ledgers for Mrs. Trump were consistent with printouts used by his firm at the time, but he would not personally vouch for them because he said money matters were handled by the company's chief financial officer, who has since died.\n\nZampolli said he did not recall Mrs. Trump working without legal permission. \"Honestly, I don't know. It's like 20 years ago,\" he said. \"The contract looks (like) a real one and the standard one.\"\n\nForeigners are not allowed to use a visitor visa to work for pay in the U.S. for American companies. Doing so would violate the terms of that visa and could prohibit a foreigner from later changing his or her immigration status in the U.S. or bar the foreigner from the United States again without special permission to come back. The E-verify system started in 1997\u2014 after Mrs. Trump came to the country\u2014 and was dramatically expanded after 2007.\n\nSome ledgers obtained by the AP identify Mrs. Trump by her professional name and detail her involvement with the modeling agency from July 18, 1996, through Sept. 26, 1997. Other documents from the same accounting ledgers identify Mrs. Trump as Melanija Knaus and list $20,526 in gross earnings for the period before she was granted her work visa on Oct. 18, 1996. The documents also show the modeling company paid for her rent, lent her money and paid for her pager.\n\nSome ledgers were first made available to True.Ink, an online lifestyle publication, and then independently obtained and verified by the AP.\n\nMetropolitan International Management managed the careers of about 65 women in 1996 and 1997, according to court records. It paid the women as independent contractors, collecting a 20 percent commission and deducting expenses. The ledger shows that the firm also deducted federal taxes from the models' gross earnings, including Mrs. Trump's.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.512445092201233, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1227, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.98758789976, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 16, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 42, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161105060000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 3.4229828850855695, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/11/09/liberals-seek-ideological-shift-democratic-party/93548156/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 637, "scraper_regex": 813}}, "headline": "Liberals seek 'ideological shift' in the Democratic Party", "wordcount_as_scraped": 813, "date": "20161109200000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Progressives were calling for a more liberal agenda for the Democratic Party Wednesday as they absorbed the shock of Donald Trump's presidential win and another two years, at least, of a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nTrump's win underscored the divide among Democratic centrists and progressives allied with senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton's former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination. Progressives say election results show the party must embrace economic populism, which many centrists have long considered a political loser.\n\n\"If the Democratic Party is not clear as crystal on the side of the working man and woman of America, some opportunistic politician is going to pick up that mantle and create confusion,\" said Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. \"I don't think anyone can deny that Trump tried to sound like an economic populist.\"\n\nMoving forward, he said the party can learn from the electoral successes of ballot measures to increase the minimum wage in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington state \u2014 along with Trump's emphasis on how the current trade model hurts working people. Democrats should call for a \"full life cycle economic program,\" from investments in education and college affordability to protecting American's retirement security.\n\n\"We need to address the needs of people who have been living in stagnation,\" he said.\n\nStephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said progressives have repeatedly warned that Republicans could \"outflank\" Democrats on trade, jobs, Wall Street reform and \"corporate greed.\"\n\n\"This race should not have been so close, and Democrats will lose in the future \u2014 over and over \u2014 if they don't go through a serious ideological shift and follow Elizabeth Warren's lead, fighting against the rigged economy in a truly authentic and real way,\" she wrote in a statement.\n\nBut Matt Bennett, co-founder of the centrist think tank Third Way, disagreed that economic populism would have saved the election for Democrats. The message from voters was that they care about creating more and better jobs \u2014 not fairer jobs, he said.\n\n\"They don't care what rich people make,\" he said. \"If they cared, they would not have elected the guy with the gold-plated plane.\"\n\nDemocrats agree anti-establishment sentiment is what powered the electorate, making it hard for an insider like Clinton to convincingly argue that government could solve Americans' problems.\n\nThe question is which path forward Democrats should take.\n\n\"We need to do some real soul searching in the Democratic Party about its future,\" Sanders' former campaign manager Jeff Weaver said on CNN Wednesday. \"There's a lack of understanding by people in Washington about what's going on out in the real world. Until Democrats do that, I think they're going to have a difficult time.\"\n\nProgressives point to losses by centrist Senate candidates such as Evan Bayh, a former senator from Indiana, and Rep. Patrick Murphy of Florida as evidence that the \"Wall Street wing\" of the Democratic Party is on the decline. But Bennett noted that progressive candidates Zephyr Teachout of New York and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin also lost their bids for Congress and the Senate, respectively.\n\n\"What we don't need right now is a war inside our party or circular firing squads,\" he said.\n\nThe race for the next chair of the Democratic National Committee will become a big priority for progressives to ensure the party is capable of building a mass movement to defeat Trump, said Neil Sroka, spokesman for Democracy for America, which endorsed Sanders in the primaries.\n\n\"The only answer to the incredibly tragic loss yesterday is a massive multi-racial, multi-generational progressive political revolution similar to what Bernie Sanders was calling for,\" Sroka said.\n\nPCCC and Democracy for America vowed to fight a Trump agenda. DFA executive director Charles Chamberlain said his organization \"will do everything in our power to obstruct, delay, and halt the attacks on people of color, women, and working families that will emerge from a Trump administration.\"\n\nBut Clinton, while speaking to her supporters Wednesday morning, said Americans owe Trump \"an open mind and a chance to lead.\" And Warren, who famously sparred with Trump on social media, told the Boston Globe she is willing to put her differences with him aside and work with Trump to rebuild the economy for working people.\n\nEllison said he doesn't want to prejudge or obstruct, and he wishes Trump success. But progressives and the Congressional Black Caucus won't abandon their agendas, either.\n\nProgressives will push for infrastructure development, increases to the federal minimum wage, an expansion of Social Security, tax reform and tuition-free college at public schools for working class families. And the Congressional Black Caucus will continue to seek to rewrite the Voting Rights Act, a top priority for the caucus.\n\n\"We're going to try like hell,\" he said. \"(Republicans) will get a chance to do the right thing.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.34159779548645, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 637, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.41551459192, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161109200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.92464678178964, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/09/two-brothers-two-petitions-clemency-two-different-outcomes/96297020/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1099, "scraper_regex": 1197}}, "headline": "Two brothers, two petitions for clemency, two different outcomes", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1197, "date": "20170109170000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the 1990s, Harold and Dewayne Damper were involved in a drug trafficking operation that brought cocaine from Southern California to Jefferson Davis County, Miss. \u2014 at the rate of about 1 kilo of cocaine a month, prosecutors said.\n\nThe two brothers, known as \"Odie\" and \"Doogie,\" were indicted together, tried together, given the same sentence and, until recently, served their sentences at the same minimum-security prison.\n\nWhen President Obama announced a clemency initiative to give drug dealers like them a second chance, both applied for presidential clemency.\n\nDewayne received a commutation and was released to a halfway house last week. Harold's case was denied. He's still in prison.\n\nThe Damper case illustrates a central challenge in the clemency initiative, as the Justice Department has tried to evaluate the record 32,551 commutation petitions it's received during the Obama presidency. Each case is reviewed separately and on its own merits, leading to complaints that the criteria are often applied inconsistently and subjectively.\n\n\"I've looked at a lot of cases and wondered, why this guy and not that guy? It's the process. When you have a process that is vertical and goes through seven layers of review, you're going to get aberrational results,\" said Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota and a leading advocate of changing the clemency system. \"The problem is the process, not the president.\"\n\nThose layers of review include staff attorneys and the heads of the Office of the Pardon Attorney, the Deputy Attorney General's Office and the White House Counsel's Office. Only then do the recommendations go to the president. The Constitution gives the president alone the power to \"grant pardons and reprieves for offenses against the United States.\" Commutations are a lesser form of pardon that releases convicted criminals from prison but otherwise leaves the conviction intact.\n\nThe brothers appear to have been treated differently even before their petitions were filed.\n\nBoth sought the help of the Clemency Project 2014, an independent coalition of defense attorneys that agreed to take on clemency initiative cases for free. Dewayne received a free attorney. Harold did not and filed his petition himself.\n\n\"I didn't get no feedback from them or nothing. I didn't get looked at, really,\" Harold said in an interview from the low-security prison in Lompoc, Calif. \"To me, it's the luck of the draw who gets a lawyer. That's all it is.\"\n\nOsler said the clemency process has inadvertently perpetuated injustices in the criminal justice system. \"If you have a good lawyer, you're most likely to get a shorter sentence in the first place. And now with clemency, if you have a good lawyer for that, that helps you, too.\"\n\nThe Clemency Project would not discuss individual cases. Project Manager Cynthia Roseberry said each case is reviewed on its own merits.\n\n\"I will say this generally: Not only during this project but in my 20 years of practice, I've never found two identical defendants, not even in the same case,\" said Roseberry, a former federal public defender. \"Each defendant has their own privacy issues and their own particular circumstances, regardless of being related to each other or not. So the lawyers would have looked at them independently.\"\n\nConditions for clemency\n\nUnder the clemency initiative, the president would consider releasing federal prisoners who:\n\n\u2022 Are serving a sentence that would be substantially lower if convicted of the same crimes today.\n\n\u2022 Were non-violent, low-level offenders without significant ties to gangs.\n\n\u2022 Served at least 10 years of their sentence.\n\n\u2022 Had no \"significant\" criminal history.\n\n\u2022 Have a record of good conduct in prison.\n\n\u2022 Have no history of violence.\n\n\"The clemency initiative boils down to two basic things: Would the person have a shorter sentence if they were sentenced today? And secondly, would they be a threat to public safety if they were released?\" said Dena Iverson, a Justice Department spokeswoman. \"These public safety factors often differentiate two cases that ostensibly look very similar.\"\n\nThe public safety test considers the inmate's offense, his or her criminal history conduct while in prison \u2014 which is not part of the public record, Iverson said.\n\nThough they were convicted of the same crime, there were differences in their involvement. Harold was involved in the operation beginning in 1990. Dewayne was in a California prison serving time for a previous drug offense and didn't join until 1994. Prosecutors said both Harold and Dewayne supervised the operation, but Harold had a more significant role in the drug conspiracy.\n\nA jury acquitted both Harold and Dewayne of the conspiracy charge and of the larger weights. Although Harold was charged with trafficking in 96 kilograms over eight years \u2014 and Dewayne of 39 kilos over three years \u2014 they were convicted only of possessing the 18.6 grams they sold to a confidential FBI informant in 1995.\n\n\"Basically, we got found not guilty of the big drug amount and the leadership role,\" Harold said. \"We got our time for the thing we were found not guilty for. They couldn't do that now.\"\n\nA pre-sentence report, not normally public but obtained by USA TODAY, showed that the judge considered that leadership role in sentencing despite the objections of Harold's attorney. It also revealed that Harold has one juvenile assault conviction, for throwing an object at a vehicle when he was 12, injuring a baby inside. He served three months in a juvenile rehabilitation camp.\n\nWhen the brothers were sentenced in Hattiesburg, Miss., in 1999, the judge noted that Dewayne had the more serious record. He had two prior felony drug convictions; Harold had one. \"Although Mr. Harold Damper's record is less serious than Mr. Dewayne Damper's, it's still pretty serious,\" Judge Charles Pickering said, according to the transcript.\n\nHe gave them both the same mandatory minimum sentence: 30 years in prison and a $4,500 fine.\n\nIt's those mandatory minimum sentences Obama is trying to reverse through his clemency power.\n\nThe emphasis on the word \"individual\" is in contrast to advocates of clemency-by-category, who want to see Obama grant mercy to broad categories of offenders, from low-level drug traffickers to undocumented immigrants.

A number of his policies \u2014 from health care to his contentious relationship with Israel \u2014 could be short-lived as President-elect Donald Trump becomes the 45th president later this week and vows to reverse some of those policies.\n\nTrump has been vocal about his disapproval of many of Obama's policies, often voicing his disagreement or engaging in public disputes with the president on Twitter. Most recently, Trump lashed out over hypothetical comments Obama made that he would beat Trump if they ran against each other in a general election.\n\nOver the holidays, Trump accused Obama of throwing up \"inflammatory\" roadblocks during the transition of power and his administration of treating Israel with \"total disdain.\"\n\nObama acknowledged it's been an \"unusual\" transition, adding, \"I suspect the president-elect would agree with that.\"\n\n\"We are moving into an era where a lot of people get their information through tweets and soundbites and some headline that comes over their phone,\" the president said. \"There's a power in that.

Bannon.\n\nTrump's critics are bashing the Bannon appointment by saying the website he once headed \u2014 Breitbart News \u2014 traffics in racism and anti-Semitism, while the president-elect and his aides defend the newly appointed chief strategist and senior counselor to the Trump White House.\n\nBannon himself has been accused of sharing the racist, anti-Semitic, and sexist views of some on what is called the \"alt-right.\" Trump aides said he is not like that.\n\n\n\n\n\"That's not the Steve Bannon that I know and I've spent a lot of time with him,\" Priebus said on MSNBC's Morning Joe. \"And here's a guy who's a Harvard Business School, London School of Economics, (and) 10-year Naval officer advising admirals. He was a force for good on the campaign at every level that I saw, all the time.\"\n\nRichard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Bannon turned Breitbart into a platform for the alt-right, which he described as \"simply a re-branding of white nationalism and is the energy behind the avalanche of racist and anti-Semitic harassment that plagued social media platforms for the entire presidential campaign.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Breitbart plans to capitalize on its increased readership by expanding its Washington bureau and perhaps opening offices in other countries.\n\nIn announcing the appointments of Priebus and Bannon, Trump described both as \"highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.\"\n\nKellyanne Conway, the campaign manager for Trump, said Priebus and Bannon would \"make a great team\" because \"they complement each other. They both have the most important thing: the ear of the boss.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats, meanwhile, pounced on the Bannon appointment. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Cal., said \"there must be no sugarcoating the reality that a white nationalist has been named chief strategist for the Trump administration.\"\n\nProminent White House jobs are challenging for anybody, analysts said, especially for those who come from outside the political system -- and the criticism of Bannon makes the challenge even tougher.\n\n\"First of all, you never want staff to be the story,\" said David Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Akron who specializes in White House organization. \"When the staff becomes the story, it has a negative impact on the White House and the president.\"\n\nMany analysts see Trump as picking from different sides of the Republican coalition. Priebus represented the party establishment as chairman of the Republican National Committee, while Bannon became a leader of a more aggressive conservatism that opposed various trade and immigration policies.\n\nBreitbart News clearly backed Trump during his presidential bid and attacked numerous Republicans for being insufficiently conservative. That group includes House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., a Priebus ally.\n\nBringing Bannon into the White House is a signal that, \"despite his reach-across-the-divide rhetoric, Trump has no intention of distancing himself from the alt-right or the racist, sexist, anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric that shaped his campaign,\" Hemmer said.\n\nSeveral analysts noted that Trump announced the Priebus and Bannon hires in tandem, and that their different forms of influence with Trump sets up the possibility of competing power centers. The announcement from the Trump transition team said that Priebus and Bannon will be \"working as equal partners to transform the federal government.\"\n\nRepublican consultant Bruce Haynes, founding partner of Washington-based Purple Strategies, said Priebus is more likely to the \"power center,\" given the chief of staff's control over personnel and organization, while Bannon will be more of a \"sounding board\" for the presidency.\n\n\"Bannon will provide insight into some aspects of the movement that was behind Trump, but his role is likely to be more advisory,\" Haynes said. \"Bannon won't have the relationships inside the government and the Congress like Priebus has to drive an agenda.\"\n\nRick Tyler, a conservative Republican who is an MSNBC analyst, said this can go one of two ways. One is \"the healthy way\" in which Trump solicits a variety of views and acts on some of them.\n\n\"Or it can go the Machiavellian way,\" he said, \"and there will be a power struggle.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.24586296081543, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 756, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.16227766017, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114180000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.9100529100529107, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/12/01/south-korea-political-crisis-poised-derail-us-priorities/94607286/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1349, "scraper_regex": 1068}}, "headline": "South Korea political crisis could derail U.S. priorities in the region", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1068, "date": "20161201180000", "story_content": "The pro-U.S. foreign policy of South Korean President Park Geun Hye is at risk now that she appears to be on her way out over a growing corruption scandal.\n\nPark, whose approval ratings are an abysmal 4%, faces possible impeachment by South Korea's legislature \u2014 if she doesn't resign first \u2014 and massive street protests over the power she is accused of granting to a controversial personal friend, Choi Soon-sil. Prosecutors allege that Choi, the daughter of a deceased cult leader who mentored Park, used her relationship with Park to extort $68 million in corporate donations to foundations Choi controlled, and invested the money.\n\nHere is a look at several policies Park spearheaded with U.S. approval that could be jettisoned along with her:\n\nPark's initial policy toward North Korea was to engage through trust-building measures, but her approach made an abrupt turnaround after the North's nuclear test in January.\n\n\"It affected everything with North Korea, China and Japan,\" said John Delury, who teaches international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. \"Now, with the equally sudden demise of the president, it puts into question the new hard-line policy.\"\n\nPark in February ordered South Korean companies to pull out of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, to protest a North Korean missile launch. The plant, which uses North Korean labor and South Korean management and expertise, was a major source of funds for the North, and one of the few remaining avenues for cultural exchange between the two countries.\n\nIf she leaves office, \"the liberal opposition would reopen it,\" Delury said.\n\nPark's new approach was in line with U.S. efforts to isolate North Korea and deprive it of foreign sources of income. President Obama said in September that new and existing sanctions show North Korea there are \"consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions.\"\n\nKathleen Stephens, who served as U.S. ambassador to South Korea from 2008 to 2011, said opposition parties are likely to call for more active efforts to re-engage with Pyongyang on a raft of issues, and to argue that Park's hard-line policy has not worked. It would be \"a major project\" to reopen relations with the North, but options would include a resumption of food and humanitarian aid, plus family reunions that took place in past years.\n\nSuch voices have already spoken out. Chung-in Moon, a foreign affairs adviser to South Korea's opposition, in September called for suspending joint military exercises with the United States and for encouraging dialogue with the North. Such a move by South Korea would be seen as a step toward rejecting the U.S. security umbrella in the region that has existed since the 1950s, said Yun Sun, an analyst at the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank.\n\nAfter North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test, in September, Park approved the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), to protect South Korean cities and 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in her country.\n\nThe system allows the U.S. to assert its protective role and contain nuclear threats from rogue nations like North Korea.\n\nThe proposed deployment angered China \u2014 South Korea's most important trading partner \u2014 which sees the system as a threat to its aircraft and missile capabilities. The deployment is also controversial among South Koreans who question the system's effectiveness, Delury said. \"There is evidence already that North Koreans are figuring out a way around it,\" he said.\n\nSouth Korea's liberal opposition party, which seeks better relations with China in hopes it could temper North Korea, is among the fiercest critics of THAAD. While the liberals may not cancel the $850 million system financed by the U.S., they would likely block its expansion. And if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on his campaign promise to make U.S. allies pay more for their defense, the THAAD deployment could be scrapped.\n\n\"If the Trump administration decides to use THAAD as an example of his policy to have allies pay their own way, a liberal (South Korean) president could call Trump's bluff,\" Delury said.\n\nPark's government this year ordered South Korea's military to exchange security information for the first time with Japan, a bitter enemy in past decades. The arrangement was encouraged by Obama and his predecessors who've long sought to reconcile the U.S. allies so they could cooperate on security and form a unified front against North Korea and China.\n\nMany South Koreans, however, continue to distrust Japan because of its occupation of Korea during the first half of the 20th century, said Jenny Town, assistant director of the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.\n\n\"South Koreans are always very skeptical of too much military cooperation between South Korea and Japan because of the history between the two countries,\" she said.\n\nAnd North Korea and China, the South's neighbors to the north and west, see the arrangement as \"the U.S. trying to create collective security,\" she said. With the coming change of government, \"it's too early to tell how this is going down.\"\n\nHow a post-Park South Korea balances policy toward the United States and China is also hard to predict, in part because the U.S. is going through its own transition, Stephens said. South Korea's trade with China has gotten so big that South Koreans now worry about over-dependence.\n\n\"That's why the U.S. alliance has come to be more valued,\" Stephens said. But Korea also has \"a huge relationship with Beijing,\" she added.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump called the U.S.-Korea Free-Trade Agreement reached in 2012 a \"job-killing trade deal.\" He also threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, which would hurt the economies of all the countries in the region.\n\nTo save the free-trade agreement, South Koreans will seek to \"point out increased trade and services that benefit the U.S.,\" Stephens said. \"They're watching very closely, wondering what the new Trump administration will do.\"\n\nBut South Korea is also developing an alternative, since it shares a long history with China, and trade between the two outweighs trade with the U.S. and Japan combined.\n\nUnder Park, South Korea joined the China-organized Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, a counter to a Western development effort. And many among South Korea's opposition hope to develop a more conciliatory atmosphere toward China, Sun said.\n\nThat could spell further trouble for other U.S. priorities, because the \"Chinese feel confident they have a piece of critical leverage over South Korean politicians,\" Sun said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.9820971488952601, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1349, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.83717936988, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161201180000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.14974054855448, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/30/11k-seized-airport-settlement/94699844/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 822, "scraper_regex": 769}}, "headline": "After $11K seized at airport, man to get money back plus interest", "wordcount_as_scraped": 769, "date": "20161201010000", "story_content": "COVINGTON, Ohio \u2014 A man who lost $11,000 to deputized federal agents in a so-called civil seizure because his luggage smelled like marijuana is getting all his money back from the government plus interest in a settlement filed with the federal courts Tuesday.\n\nIn June 2015, Charles Clarke II sued with assistance from the Institute of Justice, a Washington-based legal advocacy agency, to get his money back from the seizure, which occurred in February 2014.\n\nAt the time, two local police officers, including one from Covington and one from the police force at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, took Clarke's money after a ticket agent reported that his luggage smelled like pot. A drug dog also indicated marijuana was present near the cash that Clarke was carrying in his pocket.\n\nThe officers felt that was enough proof to seize the money, even though Clarke was not charged with any drug crimes and no drugs were found. Clarke was arrested and charged with resisting arrest, but those charges were later dropped.\n\nClarke, who said at the time he was headed back to Florida with the cash to pay his college tuition, was never charged with any drug crimes.\n\nThe two officers were working for a federal Drug Enforcement Administration task force at the airport, giving them federal power to take assets and cash if drug activity was suspected. That can happen even without a criminal arrest.\n\nNeither Clarke nor the government admitted they were wrong in the settlement.\n\n\"However, to avoid the uncertainty and expense of further litigation of this matter, the parties agree to settle and compromise this action,\" the two sides wrote in the settlement.\n\nClarke declined comment through Institute of Justice lawyers. But Institute lawyer Darpana Sheth said that he was \"relieved that this ordeal was finally over.\"\n\n\"What a great early Christmas present,\" Sheth said. \"But seriously, he was very lucky to file a claim early on and that we were able to help him. Otherwise, he would have been out of luck, especially since the burden of proof is on the property owner and not the government. In the greater scheme of things, such settlements are rare, although we are finding more success when we try to defend people.\"\n\nSheth said that Clarke should receive his money within a month, saying the total interest is not known but that it \"shouldn't be more than a few hundred dollars.\"\n\nKyle Edelen, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Kentucky, which handled the case for the government, said the settlement had \"resolved\" the issue and declined further comment.\n\nEarlier this month, the federal judge overseeing the case expressed skepticism over the government's case.\n\n\"Frankly, the fella sounds like he's telling the truth,\" U.S. District Court Judge William O. Bertelsman said at a hearing.\n\nUnder the program, local agencies can work as federal agents and take the money, keeping up to 80% of what they seize after legal proceedings are complete. The government can keep it if the owner cannot prove the goods are \"innocent\" and not being used for or received from illegal means.Yet while the government tracks how much is taken in, what is distributed to local agencies and what is bought with the money, no data on how many arrests were made is kept.\n\n\"That puts the onus on the property owners, many of whom can't afford lawyers to get their assets,\" Sheth said. \"In this case, there would have been no way Charles could have gotten his money back if not for some pro bono help from the Institute of Justice. The legal fees alone would have eaten up all his life savings.\"\n\nIn that same hearing this month, Bertelsman did not allow the case to be used as an overall test on the constitutionality of the federal seizure/forfeiture program.\n\nSeizures/forfeitures have become increasingly controversial, spurring a bipartisan criminal justice reform effort that includes libertarian Republicans such as U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Garrison, who has called the program \"legal robbery.\" In addition, the ACLU and other civil rights groups have joined in.\n\nEighteen states have reformed their own forfeiture laws in the last five years, and Ohio is considering such a move in the coming year. Another four states have prohibited local agents from participating in the federal seizure program as well, according to Lee McGrath, the Institute of Justice's legislative counsel.\n\n\"State legislatures should not allow their authority to be circumvented by police chiefs who prefer to outsource their forfeiture litigation to the federal government because it's easier and it pays better,\" McGrath said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.74862194061279, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 822, "FairnessVirtue": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.42234774445, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161201010000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 3.1630170316301696, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/05/ryan-gop-defund-planned-parenthood-obamacare-repeal/96212550/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Ryan: GOP to defund Planned Parenthood in Obamacare repeal", "wordcount_as_scraped": 728, "date": "20170106040000", "story_content": "U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that Republicans would cut federal money for Planned Parenthood as part of their repeal of Obamacare \u2014 a move that could affect 50,000 Wisconsin patients of the group.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has 21 clinics in Wisconsin providing services such as contraceptives, screening for cervical cancer and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, with the majority of its patients covered through state and federal Medicaid programs.\n\nTwo of the group's clinics in the state primarily perform abortions but those services are not covered by federal programs such as Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the life of the mother.\n\nSince 2011 in Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker and lawmakers have already taken action to stop money under state control from going to Planned Parenthood, which the group says has contributed to the closure of five clinics here.\n\nBut the GOP-held Congress and President-elect Donald Trump could go even further and Ryan said Thursday that Republicans would seek to do just that as they work to undo the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"The Planned Parenthood legislation would be in our (repeal) bill,\" Ryan said.\n\nRELATED: Ryan: Obamacare phaseout will leave 'no one worse off'\n\nRELATED: Walker: Transition from Obamacare in right way\n\nRyan's remarks came a day after a report issued by a special House panel criticized Planned Parenthood for providing tissue from aborted fetuses to researchers.\n\nRyan's comments drew immediate criticism from Nicole Safar, a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, who said that in many cases her group's patients would struggle to find other health care providers in their area who accepted Medicaid coverage. She said 83% of the group's patients for the most recent year \u2014 49,792 of them in all \u2014 have all or part of their health coverage through Medicaid.\n\n\"Patients are choosing to come to us because there aren't other providers doing this for low-income people,\" Safar said.\n\nRyan spokesman Ian Martorana said that previous congressional efforts to block federal payments to Planned Parenthood have sought to redirect the money to other providers.\n\n\"This ensured that patients would have the opportunity to continue to receive care,\" Martorana said. \"This year, any defunding of Planned Parenthood will afford similar protections for patients.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood argues that its abortion services are paid for with private money while critics contend that the public funds for other services end up subsidizing the group's overall operations.\n\nNationally, the defunding would take away roughly $400 million in Medicaid money from Planned Parenthood, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and would result in roughly 400,000 women losing access to care, The Associated Press reported. Health care providers aren't required to accept Medicaid, which typically does not cover the full cost of medical procedures.\n\nSince 2011, the cut in state-controlled money going to the group has already contributed to the closing of Wisconsin clinics in Shawano, Beaver Dam, Chippewa Falls, Fond du Lac and Johnson Creek, Safar said. More clinics would close under Ryan's plan and other health care providers likely won't be able to help all of the patients affected, she said.\n\n\"We do it because we're a mission-driven organization. We lose money on every Medicaid patient we see,\" she said.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump said \"millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood,\" but he also backed defunding the group.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is opposed by anti-abortion activists and most Republicans. Polls, however, show that the group is favorably viewed by a sizable majority of Americans \u2014 59% in a Gallup survey last year.\n\nThe defunding effort also could complicate the Obamacare repeal in the Senate, where at least one GOP member \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine \u2014 cited the defunding language in opposing the repeal effort in late 2015, said the AP.\n\nRepublican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood in Madison and Washington, D.C., intensified after anti-abortion activists released secretly recorded videos in 2015 showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing how they sometimes provide fetal tissue to researchers \u2014 a legal practice as long as no profit is made from it. The group's clinics in Wisconsin do not share these tissues.\n\nThe House GOP report issued Wednesday accused the group of violating federal laws by altering abortion procedures to obtain fetal tissue and disclosing patients' private information to firms that procure the tissue, the AP reported.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and did so again Wednesday.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 21, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.25921511650085, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 751, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.02199824061, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170106040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.52729693741678, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/11/18/obama-tried-reassure-nato-allies-over-trump-so-why-arent-they-reassured/94036324/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 959, "scraper_regex": 839}}, "headline": "Obama reassured NATO allies over Trump.

So why doesn't Europe believe it?\n\n\"The bottom line is, yes \u2014 people need to hear it from Trump himself,\" said Kurt Volker, the former U.S. representative to NATO in the Bush and Obama administrations. \"No one believes Obama can speak for Trump.\"\n\nTrump, after all, had questioned during the campaign whether the NATO alliance was still too stuck in the Cold War and unable to effectively combat terrorism. And he suggested that the United States would consider how much an ally spent on its own military before responding under the treaty provision that requires mutual defense.\n\n\"Trump needs to make clear as soon as possible that he will stand by the solemn security guarantee to NATO all his predecessors since Harry Truman have upheld,\" said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and former Obama representative to NATO. \"Obama's reassurances are welcome, but the ball is in Trump's court.\"\n\nBut Daalder said Congress could help by signalling its commitment to NATO in the upcoming defense policy bill, and ratifying Montenegro's inclusion in the alliance. And if NATO still needs reassurances, it can call another summit for next year, just one year after the last meeting in Warsaw in July, he said.\n\nStanding next to Obama at that Thursday news conference in Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said only, \"I approach this with an open mind.\"\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Theresa May was one of the first leaders to call and congratulate Trump after her election. The British summary of the call made no mention of NATO, but a spokeswoman told Reuters this week that it would be at the top of her agenda when they meet.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande, who previously said Trump made him \"want to retch,\" said after the election that Trump's election marks the beginning of a \"period of uncertainty.\"\n\n\"This is no time to question the value of the partnership between Europe and the United States,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg wrote in an op-ed in the Guardian Tuesday, not mentioning Trump by name. \"Going it alone is not an option, either for Europe or for the United States.\"During the campaign, Trump said he would consider whether a NATO ally had spent enough on its own military before deciding whether to commit the United States to defend it.\n\nEven before Trump's election, Brexit had put a strain on the alliance. On Friday, the Europeans were back to arguing about a possible European Union military force separate and parallel to NATO. The Germans and the French are openly entertaining the idea, while the British \u2014 who just voted to leave the EU this year \u2014 say NATO must remain the primary focus. At a press conference with Merkel Friday, May said the U.K. could only support other defense initiatives \"where those complement NATO.\"\n\nAs this was happening, Obama was leaving Berlin for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru for one last Asia \"pivot.\"\n\nBut she said questions about the future of the alliance might prompt both sides to stop taking it for granted. Only five countries \u2014 the United States, the United Kingdom, Greece, Poland and Estonia \u2014 devote the required 2% of their economies to defense. \"In reality, the Europeans are very, very worried. This is not a bad thing. They have been free riders - at least most of them - for such a long time. This time is coming to an end,\" she said.\n\nAt another time, these might be abstract questions, full of all the nuances required of diplomacy. But Russia has become increasingly bellicose in recent months, buzzing NATO ships in the Baltic Sea with their war planes, bombing anti-Assad forces in Syria and continuing its grip on Crimea. That's to say nothing of its mischief in cyberspace.\n\nBut with two months to go until Inauguration Day, Volker said there's plenty of time for the Trump administration to sort out its European policy \"Everyone should calm down,\" he said. \"Just see what happens and deal with that as it develops. It will likely be a lot more normal than people assume.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.4953271150588998, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 959, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.31602817108, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161118220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.33680917622523, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2017/01/25/american-meteorological-society-freedom-scientific-expression/97040684/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 533, "scraper_regex": 479}}, "headline": "Censorship, political meddling has no place in science, weather group says", "wordcount_as_scraped": 479, "date": "20170125220000", "story_content": "SEATTLE \u2014 The nation's top group of weather and climate professionals sounded the alarm Wednesday about scientific freedom of expression, after the White House issued a gag order on some federal employees' social media posts.\n\n\"The ability of scientists to present their findings to the scientific community, policy makers, the media, and the public without censorship, intimidation or political interference is imperative,\" the American Meteorological Society said at its annual meeting.\n\n\"These principles matter most \u2014 and at the same time are most vulnerable to violation \u2014 precisely when science has its greatest bearing on society,\" the statement added, noting how weather and climate greatly impact a wide range of issues, such as public health and safety, environmental protection and national security.\n\nThe declaration came as controversy and uncertainty swirl over how federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of the Interior will communicate with the public about climate change and other environmental issues under Trump, who has often called climate change a hoax.\n\nA directive this week ordered employees at the EPA to halt all external communications and posts on social media. And the Interior Department temporarily shut down its Twitter account after a National Park Service employee retweeted side-by-side photos of the crowds that gathered in 2009 on the National Mall for President Obama's first inaugural and the much smaller number who came to witness Trump's swearing-in.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Park Service's Badlands National Park posted several tweets that made a forceful case about the hazards of climate change, but the posts were deleted by the end of the day.\n\nScott Pruitt, Trump's choice to run the EPA, said in last week's Senate confirmation hearings that he believes climate change is real.

It was the first post-election press conference, so there was lots of ground to cover. Several topics that could have been the subject of a press conference all their own got little or no answer from the president-elect. And CNN might as well have just watched the whole thing on CNN ... because Trump's not taking their questions at all.\n\nThe main course (aside from awkward turtle soup) was the unveiling of the long-awaited plan for Trump's businesses while he's in office. We've got that and more in today's edition of For the Record.\n\nThe Trumpire strikes back\n\nIf it's all the same to you, Trump's gonna just hang on to his businesses, thanks. Trump's claim to fame, his business acumen, is the reason that many voters backed him in November. But the businesses he owns could now benefit from his political actions. Many government ethicists and even a few aestheticians called on Trump to sell off his business interests before taking office \u2014 or at the very least putting them under the control of a blind trust. A blind trust is where businesses are put under the control of a third party who has no communication with the owner. Trump said, sure, I got your blind trust right here ... I'm putting my sons in charge of Trump empire.\n\n\"I could actually run my business and run government at the same time,\" Trump said Wednesday during a news conference, his first since winning the presidency. \"I don't like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to.\"\n\nCritics aren't thrilled with the plan. \"The plan the president has announced doesn't meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting and that every president in the past four decades has met,\" Walter Shaub, the head of the Office of Government Ethics, told reporters Wednesday. \"I don't think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president of the United States of America.\"\n\nTrump lawyer Sheri Dillon says Team Trump sees it differently. \"The American people were well aware of President-elect Trump's business empire and financial interests when they voted,\" Dillon said. \"Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.\"\n\nGarbage Fail Kids\n\nLet's talk about the bigger issue: Trump called BuzzFeed a \"failing pile of garbage\"? BuzzFeed, the site that published in full the 35-page document outlining Trump's alleged ties to Russia, met with specific ire during the press conference. But ... failing? We would have gone with \"flaming pile of garbage,\" personally. First there's the garbage, which is bad enough; then there's that burning garbage smell, so it's a double-whammy.\n\nWe're sure Trump wanted to get the whole \"failing\" aspect in there, but it would be pretty difficult to fail at being a pile of garbage ... maybe if someone tried to contain all the garbage into a neat pile, but got lazy and wound up with a garbage-strewn area? That's at least one method to fail at garbage-piling. We're gonna be thinking about this all day. Either way, BuzzFeed is selling t-shirts now.\n\nOh, and then there's the secretary of State hearings\n\nIf we learned anything from the early rounds of confirmation hearings, it's that Trump's nominees to key cabinet positions don't always see eye to eye with The Donald (and it's not a bad thing that there are differences of opinion). Rex Tillerson, former Exxon CEO and secretary of State nominee, agrees with the president-elect that China is a growing threat to the country's Asia policy and that ISIS is our top security threat.\n\nOn the other hand, Tillerson takes a harder line against Russia than Trump has, saying that \"Russia today poses a danger. It invaded Ukraine, including Crimea, and violated the laws of war.\" He advocates arming Ukraine to defend against further Russian incursions. As for Trump's proposed freeze on Muslim immigration? \"I don't support a blanket type of travel ban on people coming to this country,\" he said.

John Lewis.\n\n\"We all dissociate ourselves with the brand, the Donald Trump brand of division and insult coupled with his lack of knowledge of the magnitude of the office that he's about to enter,\" said Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-N.C., who announced his plans Tuesday to skip the swearing-in.\n\nButterfield, the former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he has been in \"deep thought\" over the last several weeks about whether to attend Trump's swearing-in. \"I was just offended time and time again during the campaign with Donald Trump's politics of division and insult,\" he said.\n\n\"I just feel that he's not prepared to be president. He's not prepared to be commander in chief.\"\n\nTrump slammed Lewis on Twitter saying he should spend more time fixing his district that is falling apart and that he was \"all talk, talk, talk \u2014 no action or results. Sad!\"\n\nTrump continued the feud Tuesday. \"John Lewis said about my inauguration, 'It will be the first one that I've missed.' WRONG (or lie)!,'' he tweeted. \"He boycotted Bush 43 also.\" Lewis' office acknowledged that the lawmaker had skipped Bush's inauguration in 2001.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, more than 50 lawmakers said they wouldn't attend the swearing-in. Some had already said they wouldn't go, but many others said Trump's criticism of Lewis spurred them to skip the inauguration.\n\nThroughout the day, Democrats weighed in on Twitter with announcements they won't be at the Capitol when Trump takes the oath of office Friday.\n\nRep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said he will be in Washington to greet constituents attending inauguration events, but he won't be at Trump's swearing-in.\n\n\"Every American should respect the office of the presidency and the fact that Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States,\" Castro said in a statement. \"But winning an election does not mean a man can show contempt for millions of Americans and then expect those very people to celebrate him.\"\n\nRep. John Yarmuth, a Democrat from Kentucky, said it's not a decision he made lightly. He said he's heard from hundreds of constituents in the wake of Trump's attacks against Lewis and complained that Trump has used his \"bully pulpit for insult and ridicule.''\n\nYarmuth said \"it is not my intent to protest the election results or to make a statement about policy.\" However, he said, \"I will not be attending the inauguration because I believe the office of the president deserves our respect and that respect must begin with the President-elect himself.\"\n\nScott Golden, chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, said he's disappointed some lawmakers have decided not attend, particularly since Lewis didn't go to the 2001 inauguration of George W. Bush.\n\n\"Obviously, Congressman Lewis is a hero of the civil rights movement,'' Golden said. \"However, not attending the inauguration seems more partisan than it is patriotic. Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States. It is incumbent on everyone to work together to make America great again.\"\n\nButterfield said he will attend Trump's State of the Union Address.\n\n\"After the inauguration and after the State of the Union, I'm hoping that we will see a Donald Trump that is transformed,\" he said. \"And that once he settles in he will recognize the enormity of his responsibility. And I would hope that he would become a responsible leader. But right now, he's acting very irresponsibly.\"\n\nMany lawmakers boycotting the inauguration are members of the Congressional Black Caucus, but the caucus has issued no formal statement on the matter.\n\nButterfield called the decision whether to attend a personal choice.\n\n\"Each CBC member has his or own conscience and their own politics they have to resolve,'' he said.\n\nRichmond credits Lewis and other civil rights veterans for fighting to open the doors for him and other African Americans.\n\n\"In a tweet, the President-elect of the United States chose to ignore all of that for petty silliness,\" Richmond said. \"I think that's unfortunate. I think the reaction throughout the country, Democrat and Republican, black and white is very fitting where people are taking up for John Lewis' past.\"\n\nRichmond said if he was not head of the 49-member black caucus he would not consider going to the inauguration.\n\n\"If I were not the chairman, there's no way I would be there,'' he said. \"But being in a different role I think that sometimes you have to make sacrifices. So if I'm there sitting through that inauguration you will know that I'm absolutely making a sacrifice to be there.''", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.23166847229004, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 784, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.16661368869, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117200000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.55102040816327, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2017/01/22/how-should-media-cover-donald-trump/96840686/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 832, "scraper_regex": 763}}, "headline": "How should the media cover Donald Trump?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 763, "date": "20170123010000", "story_content": "How do we cover Donald Trump? That's the confounding, or, in some cases, head-exploding question being asked in every news organization.\n\nCertainly, the media, even the liberal-biased media, has with professional equanimity covered right-wing administrations before. The vast economic transformation of the Reagan years were taken in relative media stride. If anything, the media went easy on George W. Bush during the Iraq war.\n\nNo, it isn't just politics that's got the media in existential despair over Donald Trump. It's attitude, it's behavior, it's language, it's the rules of decorum, or the full-scale abandonment of those rules, that has left the media not only uncertain about its role, but quite thinking its role must be to defend propriety and resist whatever unfamiliar, louche, rude, and right-wing thing is to come.\n\nLast week, John Lewis, an important figure in the Civil Rights movement, and, since 1987, a congressman representing Georgia's 5th district, declared, in certainly fighting words, that Donald Trump's presidency was illegitimate. The issue of \"legitimacy\" has become a byword for the Trump resistance, something of an unfamiliar charge in the U.S.'s well-trod and remarkably orderly electoral system. (Democrats expressed outrage during the campaign at the suggestion that Trump might question the legitimacy of the expected Hillary Clinton landslide.) Still, Lewis, however hyperbolically, has the right to make that charge, and, he announced, to snub the Trump inauguration (he snubbed George W. Bush's inaugural too).\n\nPresidents are accused of many things and tend to respond judiciously. Trump, who likes to describe himself as a counter-puncher, tends, however, to respond in kind. This is partly because Twitter makes it easy to do, and offers a way around advisors and cooler heads who might urge otherwise. And this is, in part, because, so far it's been an effective tactic for him. Almost everybody everywhere thought his attack on the gold-star father, Khizr Khan who, at the Democratic convention, attacked him, was lose-lose. Instead, it presaged Trump's historic win.\n\nHow does the media deal with a President who lets no insult pass without returning one of his own?\n\nDavid Remnick, the editor of the New Yorker, for instance, responded apoplectically to Trump's apoplectic tweet to Lewis' apoplectic charge. In this, if the President is breaking character, so is the New Yorker.\n\nThe New Yorker, in its almost one hundred years of publishing, has pursued a specific style of journalism, one that's carefully detached and closely reported. Opinion, if there is opinion, in the issues and events it covers, is grounded in granular details. Even its famous anti-war reporting during the Vietnam war was based on a close examination of specific aspects of the war.\n\nAt the Wall Street Journal, there has been a debate about how to characterize, what many regard as, Trump's disregard for the truth. Should his misstatements be labeled as outright lies? The Journal's editor, Gerry Baker, argued, no, the facts should be clear, but a motive, to purposefully mislead, should not be assumed. This was met, both at his paper, and across the social media world, with quite some disbelief because, well, what do you call chronic exaggeration, frequent disregard of the facts, and reckless spouting off?\n\nOr, perhaps more to the point, how does the media deal with rhetoric more powerful than its own?\n\nAnother question worth asking is how the media's reaction might differ if it were a loquacious left-wing insurgent uncontrollably riffing and counter-punching at every opportunity. The issue may not be Trump at all, but, the startling socio-political divide he's revealed. It's two nations opposed to each other, with the media almost entirely on one side of the divide. It's not so much Trump that the media doesn't know how to cover, but a social movement that sees the media as one of its significant enemies. In this, Trump's behavior, his constant tweets, his tit for tats, his free associations, his high baloney quotient are all designed to disrupt the media foe, and, among other things, give it a nervous breakdown. In other words, the media is taking the Trump bait.\n\nBut the other point has to do with Barack Obama. He may be remembered as the ultimate media President. Not a President who was good at using the media\u2014in this, he was at best lackluster. But someone who made the media feel good. Here was a cautious, literate, idealistic, man of restraint, who, while not forceful or inspiring enough to help his party defeat Donald Trump, nevertheless consistently spoke to the media's better nature.\n\nBut now he is gone and the media feels bad about itself.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.8461537361145, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 1, "wordcount": 832, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.30701409826, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.125, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/17/dan-quayle-advice-to-mike-pence/96686556/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1069, "scraper_regex": 627}}, "headline": "What Dan Quayle says Mike Pence should expect as veep", "wordcount_as_scraped": 627, "date": "20170118000000", "story_content": "Few people can understand the transition Vice President-elect Mike Pence and his family are undergoing right now as he prepares to assume the nation's second-highest office.\n\nOne who can is a fellow Hoosier native, former Vice President Dan Quayle.

The company said the move was necessary to make things more efficient, a key goal of the merger.\n\nAmerican and Arizona-based US Airways merged in December 2013 but the merged airline has not been able to combine flight crews until now because it didn't have a combined labor contract covering the pilots of American, US Airways and America West. America West and US Airways merged in 2005 but fought over seniority integration for years and never had a combined contract.\n\nMORE AIRLINE NEWS: Southwest Airlines stands by free-bag policy | Phoenix council approves expansion of Sky Harbor's Terminal 4, Sky Train | First look: Sky Harbor Terminal 3 upgrades\n\nThe three pilot groups, represented by the Allied Pilots Association, agreed on seniority integration in September. Seniority dictates a pilot's work life, from which base they call home to the type of aircraft and routes they fly.\n\nThe Phoenix crew base is most affected because American has decided to spread its A320 trips for pilots throughout its hubs instead of the trips being so concentrated into and out of Phoenix. The Phoenix concentration was a byproduct of US Airways and America West and their A320 heavy fleets. Of American's 1,435 pilots based in Phoenix, 1,140 are Airbus pilots.\n\nThe change will also bring some flexibility and career advancement for Phoenix-based pilots with seniority, many of whom have been locked in to certain routes since 2005, according to an American representative.\n\n\"The Phoenix pilots haven't been able to move out of their base for 11 years and with this they'll have the opportunity to upgrade to captain of a larger airplane, both of which come with more money,'' spokeswoman Leslie Mayo said. \"And they'll have the opportunity to transfer bases and perhaps move where they live instead of commute.''\n\nOn the flip side, the most junior pilots will likely be negatively by the reduced A320 pilot trips originating in Phoenix because they will have to fly out of another hub, whether they move there or not, upsetting their work and family routine.\n\n\"The news here is a bit mixed \u2013 we understand that,'' Kimball Stone, the airline's vice president of flight operations said in a message to pilots.\n\nOverall, Stone notes, American is growing its pilot ranks, not reducing them. American plans to hire 750 pilots next year, 450 to cover planned retirements given the mandatory pilot retirement age of 65.\n\nThe news about the shrunken Phoenix pilot base follows American's announcement in August that it plans to close its Phoenix flight training center near Sky Harbor, as it consolidates those functions at its Dallas/Fort Worth and Charlotte hubs.\n\nRELATED: American Airlines to close Phoenix flight-training facility | Sky Harbor Airport now posts TSA wait times | Sky Harbor Airport valet parking | Sky Harbor Then and Now | Arizona Then & Now: Phoenix Sky Harbor Terminal 3\n\nThe biggest Phoenix-area loss to date from the merger has been the loss of US Airways' headquarters in the suburb of Temp[e -- and the relatively high-paying jobs that came with it. The combined airline is based in Fort Worth, American's longtime home in Texas.\n\nWith the three year anniversary of the merger approaching, the new American hasn't dramatically reduced flights in Phoenix but its passenger numbers this summer were down dramatically from a year ago.\n\nAmerican, Sky Harbor's busiest carrier with 300 daily departures, saw passenger counts fall 5.6% in July from a year earlier and 8.2% in August.\n\nSpokeswoman Polly Tracey attributes that to the airline using smaller planes with fewer seats on some routes out of Phoenix and, in August, an early end to the airline's summer schedule, which reduced its flying in Phoenix and other hubs earlier than in previous years.\n\nShe noted that American has added or announced plans to add service to several new cities out of Sky Harbor, including Memphis and Sonoma, Calif\n\nSouthwest, the other dominant carrier at Sky Harbor, also posted year-over-year declines in traffic in the typically busy summer months of July and August, with passenger counts down 4.9% and 2.7%, respectively.\n\nDawn Gilbertson is a travel reporter at The Arizona Republic.

The rule of thumb is about six to seven auto parts workers for every auto assembly plant employee.\n\nInexpensive parts made outside the U.S. are crucial for a booming auto industry here and abroad, industry executives say.\n\nIn the wake of Trump's campaign threats to renegotiate or even pull the U.S. out of a 23-year-old trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, executives at auto component makers are keeping careful watch and plotting strategy to prepare for major changes in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that could upend their investments.\n\n\"With respect to Mexico, and particularly with respect to the auto industry, where the three countries involved with NAFTA, the whole process of automobile production is now so intertwined, that to try to untangle that would be a terrible blow to the industry,\" said Marina Whitman, former chief economist for GM who now teaches at the University of Michigan.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump administration officials said the plan for a wall along the Mexican border could be financed through a 20% border tax on all imports from Mexico. Earlier, however, others connected to the administration suggested there would be no widespread border tariff, only a specific levy targeting those who move jobs to Mexico.\n\nExperts say either move could have broad implications for auto-related jobs that have grown at home and on both sides of the border.\n\nA Trump tariff could create some winners and losers in the sector. For some auto suppliers, limited investments in Mexico could be a benefit if Trump is successful in imposing a new tax on goods made there and sold in the U.S., according to Barclays' Brian Johnson.\n\nJohnson earlier this month cited the potential for Tenneco, headquartered in suburban Chicago, as \"a clear winner given it is a U.S. federal cash taxpayer that does not import components from Mexico.\"\n\nA Tenneco spokesman declined to comment.\n\nBut other part suppliers could pay a price for heavily investing in Mexico as the low-cost industry has ramped up there.\n\nSouthfield, Mich.-based Lear, with $18.6 billion in sales, has about 46,000 employees in Mexico \u2014 four times its employment in the U.S. and Canada combined \u2014 and operates 23 plants, according to an annual report. A 2015 annual report disclosed Lear had $2.7 billion in revenue from customers with operations in Mexico.\n\n\"We are trying to keep our head in the news, as well as working with industry groups ... (and) working with our customers to determine what the outcomes would be,\" Lear CEO Matt Simoncini told Wall Street analysts on an earnings call last week when asked about changes to NAFTA.\n\nBecause the company is in a \"net import position\" \u2014 bringing more parts into the U.S. than it sends out \u2014 a Republican tax plan floated by House Speaker Paul Ryan \"would increase our tax rate, something into the 30s, if you will, from the effective tax rate of the high 20s as it stands today.\"\n\nBut Simoncini added that \"the beauty of being a company like Lear is we have the wherewithal both financially and operationally to make these components in pretty much every market we are in and that includes the U.S.\"\n\nNeighbors to the north also have a big stake.\n\nIn 2015, Canada ranked as the largest export market for U.S. automotive parts with $22 billion in parts value exported, according to the latest U.S. government statistics. Mexico was a close second, with $20.2 billion in U.S. parts value exported.\n\nLast week, the head of Canada's biggest auto parts maker confirmed he and his colleagues in Canada and the U.S. are meeting with local government officials to coordinate a response.\n\nThe group wants to show how free trade is key to the competitiveness of manufacturers across North America, Don Walker, CEO of Magna International told reporters, according to Bloomberg News. A Magna spokeswoman did not return requests for comment.\n\nTrump's threats of a border tariff as high as 35% and his hard-line approach toward threatening to withdraw from the agreement without significant concessions from Mexico worry Brandon Stallard, CEO of TPS Logistics, a Troy, Mich., auto industry company, so much that he hopes Trump is bluffing.\n\n\"When you are talking about NAFTA, absolutely, folks are very concerned. And frankly (companies) don't believe they can pivot fast enough,\" if a steep border tariff that would raise the cost of goods coming into the U.S. is imposed, said Stallard, whose firm manages about $1 billion worth of products shipped around the world annually.\n\n\"I spent some time last week with a group of suppliers and ... they very definitely are looking at contingency plans,\" he said.\n\nThe significance of the potential change to NAFTA to the relationship between the economies of the U.S., Canada and Mexico is hard to understate.\n\n\"Since the end of the Second World War, we have been on a downward trend on barriers of trade between countries,\" said Hoyt Bleakley, an associate professor of economics at the University of Michigan. \"To find the last time that someone has talked about such a significant retrenchment you would probably have to go back to the 1920s.\"\n\nThe auto industry is increasingly global and interconnected across national borders. Every assembly plant is supported by dozens, if not hundreds of automotive suppliers who also have invested billions of dollars to build plants in Mexico or on tooling in U.S. plants to send parts to Mexico that wind up coming back to the U.S. on finished vehicles.\n\nDespite a boom in Mexico, automotive components manufacturing jobs have risen nearly 19% in the U.S. since 2012, according to a study released last week by the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association. More than 871,000 Americans are directly employed by the automotive parts manufacturing industry.\n\nMexico's auto supply industry employed just more than 500,000 people in 2015. But fewer than one out of every 10 of them are in assembly plants, according to several industry estimates.\n\nThere are 345 major automotive suppliers \u2014 known as Tier 1 \u2014 with a presence in Mexico, according to a recent report by ProMexico, an arm of the Mexican government involved in economic development. In 2015 alone, automotive parts manufacturers invested $3 billion in Mexico, according to a report by the U.S. trade representative last fall.\n\nAnd the trade travels in many directions.\n\n\"Combined, our North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners account for about 75% of all U.S. parts exports. Trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico is bound by the terms of NAFTA. As a result, there are no duties on Canadian and Mexican imports of automotive parts that meet the NAFTA rule of origin,\" a 2016 report by the International Trade Administration, which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\n\"It is difficult to determine how much of the Mexican supply base would potentially move or shift production back to the United States to support the 1 million additional units of capacity needed\" in coming years, the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research wrote in a report on the impact of potential changes to NAFTA.\n\nBut those moving back to the U.S. to follow auto manufacturers \"would be few \u2014 mainly those tied to the just-in-time plants and jobs manufacturing other bulky, fragile, or otherwise difficult to ship parts and components,\" the center concluded.\n\nStallard said U.S. automotive suppliers are telling him they would struggle to find skilled workers ready and able to work in new U.S. plants at the volume that would be necessary to absorb the fallout of a 35% tariff on imported goods. He estimates that it would take the industry more than 15 years to build the plants, find the workers and train them to adapt.\n\n\"To dismantle NAFTA is just hard to believe,\" he said.\n\nBy week's end, the Trump administration made more room at his table for discussion over the future of manufacturing, including the auto industry. The White House on Friday released a list of 28 prominent business leaders \u2014 including Jim Kamsickas, president and CEO of large auto parts maker Dana Inc. \u2014 who will advise Trump on manufacturing growth.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.6760909557342529, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1489, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.7128323375699996, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170130200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.6118200134318301, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/27/vice-president-pence-tells-anti-abortion-rally-life-winning/97133940/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 754, "scraper_regex": 1131}}, "headline": "Vice President Pence tells March for Life rally: 'Life is winning'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1131, "date": "20170127180000", "story_content": "Energized by a White House administration they see as the most sympathetic in decades, and expecting the new president to pick a Supreme Court nominee who shares their views, thousands of demonstrators rallied and marched against abortion in Washington on Friday.\n\n\"Life is winning in America,\" Vice President Pence told a cheering crowd gathered near the Washington Monument.\n\nHe promised that President Trump would not only end federal funding for abortions and abortion providers, he would name a Supreme Court justice who would \"uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution.\"\n\nPence, the highest-ranking official ever to address the annual event that began 44 years ago, said Trump asked him to appear.\n\n\"To all of you marching you have my full support!\" Trump tweeted Friday morning.\n\nThe #MarchForLife is so important.

Bush.\n\n\"He wasn't as radical as Trump,\" Greer said. \"We had hope with Bush but he was just your standard Republican president so I don't think this was on his list of priorities.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood promised to fight back.\n\n\"We will not stand by as Vice President Pence tries to impose his radical, dangerous, and highly unpopular agenda on this country,\" said Dawn Laguens, Executive Vice President of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement Friday. \"Defunding Planned Parenthood will cause a national health care crisis, leaving millions with nowhere to turn for basic reproductive health care, including birth control and cancer screenings.\"\n\nThe crowd at the March for Life included a heavy concentration of students, and many had come from out of state.\n\nHundreds had bused for 30 hours from the Catholic University of Mary in Bismarck, N.D.\n\n\"We support pro-life and we think that abortion needs to be abolished,\" said Zach Saffell, a 17-year-old who came with dozens of fellow high school students from Fisher Catholic in Lancaster, Ohio.\n\nSome of the students from Lancaster carried signs calling for defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nWhen asked why he thought it was important, Saffell responded: \"We got these for free, but we think it's important to defund Planned Parenthood because if it's not funded than it will make it harder for Planned Parenthood to fund abortions.\"\n\nSome demonstrators criticized the media for drawing comparisons between the March for Life and last week's mass \"Women's March\" protests in cities around the country. That theme was also picked up by March for Life President Jeanne Mancini, who told the crowd she had been asked by reporters if she expected as many people.\n\n\"The only number I care about, and the number all of us care about, is 58 million,\" Mancini said. \"Since 1973, 58 million Americans have been lost to abortion. We stand for the little, innocent children who have lost their lives, and we stand for their mothers who regret being involved in abortion. I'd like to address the women in the audience, and watching on TV: Pro-life is pro-woman.\"\n\nTrump on Monday signed a presidential memorandum that reinstated and expanded the so-called Mexico City policy, which prohibits U.S. aid from supporting international groups that promote abortion. In addition to applying the ban to funds connected to family planning services, Trump also applied the \"gag order\" to all \"global health assistance\" provided by federal agencies. He also included new language barring federal funds from supporting organizations that participate in \"coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.\"\n\nThe Mexico City policy was first imposed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, but Democratic presidents rescinded it since then, and Republicans reinstated it.\n\nTrump also is expected to nominate a Supreme Court justice next week to succeed the late Antonin Scalia, who had been part of the conservative bloc on the court.\n\nSome in the anti-abortion movement are skeptical, however, and leaders of a group that staged a pre-rally protest on Friday morning, where about two dozen people laid down in the fetal position on Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House to stage a \"die-in.\" They said they wanted to remind Trump he has to live up to his promises.\n\n\"We're here today because we believe that what our founders said is true, that all humans are created equal in God's image,\" said Seth Drayer of an Ohio group called Created Equal. \"Every successful abortion ends in the death of a distinct living full human being.\"\n\nCongress has already begun moving anti-abortion legislation. On Tuesday, the House approved a bill sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., that would prohibit using subsidies or tax credits provided through the Affordable Care Act to buy health insurance that covers abortion. The bill also would make permanent the Hyde Amendment, which bars direct federal funding for abortion through programs such as Medicaid and federal employees' and veterans health coverage.\n\nSmith, first elected in 1980 and longtime leader of the House Pro-Life Caucus, said the effort in Congress has its most effective, articulate and compassionate backers ever.\n\n\"This is the turning point for the right-to-life movement,\" he said.\n\nHe said the House would next take up legislation sponsored by Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., to ban abortion after the fetus is able to feel pain, which advocates say happens 20 weeks after fertilization.\n\nSen Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, told the rally she would introduce a bill Monday to end funding for Planned Parenthood and redirect the money to be used at other women's health care programs.\n\nBut a poll by Quinnipiac University released Friday found that when abortion was not mentioned, only 32% of respondents supported eliminating funding compared with 62% opposed. And when the question includes a mention that the organization provides non-abortion health services, just 12% favor a cut-off and 80% are opposed.\n\n\"To all those marching today, know that we hear your words and we join your call for a nation that respects the dignity of every life,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said that leaders of both chambers \"march with you.\"\n\n\"This is truly a new dawn for the unborn and for those women and men who defend them,\" Ryan said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.362318843603134, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 754, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.7372372347400002, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.111405835543771, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/01/07/frustrated-travelers-20k-lost-items-fla-airport-resumes-operations/96288260/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Frustrated travelers, 20K lost items as Fla. airport resumes operations", "wordcount_as_scraped": 597, "date": "20170107190000", "story_content": "FORT LAUDERDALE \u2014 Less than 24 hours after Terminal 2 in the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport was turned into a bloody shooting gallery, things started getting back to normal Saturday.\n\nThe hundreds of police cruisers and SWAT vans that enveloped every corner of this airport in the hours after the shooting were mostly gone by 5 a.m., when the airport reopened.

In all, Gale said they had 20,000 items and were working to reunite people with their belongings.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott ordered the state Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to help people who lost IDs in the mad dash to evacuate the airport. And Rep.

We weren't working for anyone. We think this sort of study should be performed after every national election.''\n\nWriting after the election on Twitter, Trump claimed that 2 million to 3 million illegal immigrants had voted. He repeated the claim in a meeting this week with congressional leaders, this time setting the number at 3 million to 5 million. He also announced plans on Twitter for a federal investigation into \"VOTER FRAUD'' that would focus on \"those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal (and) \u2026 those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time).\"\n\nThis did not sound like good news to many teachers of political science, who labor as it is to get students to support assertions with evidence.\n\nTrump's example \"makes my job harder,'' said Aaron Weinschenk, who teaches undergraduate courses in politics and government at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. \"People talk about a 'post-truth' era. Not in my classroom. If you say something, you're gonna need the evidence to back it up.''\n\nDavid Caputo, a political scientist and president emeritus of Pace University in New York, worked for several decades at the News Election Service, which collected raw election data for the major TV networks and news services. He noted that state secretaries of state, who supervise elections, do not subscribe to fraud charges. (Their national association has said it was \"not aware of any evidence'' supporting Trump's charge.)\n\nCaputo said the fact that local and county election officials, most of whom are Republicans, are not always quick to purge the dead from their rolls does not mean people are surging to the polls to impersonate them.\n\nBut he was philosophical.\n\n\"It's not the first time the discipline has been attacked. People will continue to do their research, but (Trump's claim) does reinforce the stereotype of leftists trying to inculcate our students. If you say something often enough, people begin to believe it.''\n\nScience became increasingly politicized, largely over global warming, during the administration of President George W. Bush. In his inaugural address eight years ago, Barack Obama pledged to \"restore science to its rightful place.''\n\nIn 2015, Obama signed an executive order promoting the use of behavioral science data in government policy and programs and created a \"social and behavioral insights team'' to work on projects such as savings plans for military service members and college enrollment by low-income students.\n\nTrump's claims about the election results suggests he has no such regard for social science. In his tweet this week announcing the plans for an election study, he wrote: \"Depending on results we will strengthen up voting procedures!\"\n\nTrump provided no details. But one of his longtime supporters said he thought Trump wants to \"eventually ensure 100% integrity of the vote.''\n\n\"Is it really discriminatory,'' asked Gene Dunn, a Long Island limousine driver, \"to ask a person to show I.D. before casting a sacred ballot when we have to show I.D. for dozens of other less significant events?''\n\nOthers see darker motives. Caputo said Trump's move looks like a partisan attempt to suppress registration by people who'd be more likely to vote Democratic than Republican. Whatever Trump's motive, the Dartmouth study makes clear there is no social scientific basis for his claim. \"We do not uncover any evidence consistent with Trump's assertions about widespread voter fraud,'' it concluded.\n\nThe researchers also said they found no \"striking abnormalities\" in three states which had (anti-Trump) recount battles (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) or three cited by Trump himself (California, New Hampshire and Virginia).\n\nHerron, the Dartmouth professor, said he and his two co-authors expected Trump to challenge the election results if he lost (although not if he won) and began preparing their study last summer. They hired two students to help crunch numbers and contracted with the Associated Press for voting data. Using statistical analysis, they created a baseline for the expected Trump vote across the country, relying heavily on Mitt Romney's vote share from the 2012 election. But they found nothing to support Trump's charges.\n\nHerron was asked whether he was concerned about a broader politicization of social science.\n\nHe at first declined to answer. He's a social scientist \u2014 where's the data? Then he said: \"It worries me as a citizen whenever people make claims without evidence.''", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.37837839126587, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 845, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.23421922317, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.72189349112426, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/01/25/commander--congestiontrump-tower-security-slowed-traffic-crawl/97003146/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Commander-in-Congestion:Trump Tower security slowed traffic to a crawl", "wordcount_as_scraped": 697, "date": "20170125100000", "story_content": "NEW YORK \u2014 You may call him Mr. President, but frustrated New York drivers are probably thinking of Donald Trump as Commander-in-Congestion.\n\nTrump Tower traffic jams are quantifiably real, not just a bad dream recounted by ever-complaining New Yorkers and Fifth Avenue store operators, according to a new study.\n\nThe average driving speed on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue for the less than three-block stretch that passes President Trump's home and business headquarters plunged to a slow-as-molasses 7 miles per hour during the last three weeks of November, down from 15 miles per hour for the same period in 2015, the study showed.\n\nAverage trip duration for what should be a quick trip, even by New York City congestion standards, nearly doubled, from 41 seconds to 81 seconds. And the number of trips with motorists creeping along at a mind-numbing 1 mile per hour to 5 miles per hour accounted for more than 40% of the total, the study showed.\n\nThe analysis was conducted by StreetLight Data, a San Francisco-based tech company that uses big data sources to examine traffic patterns and guide urban and transportation infrastructure planning with the results. The study was conducted during the weeks after Trump won the 2016 White House race, a period when the U.S. Secret Service and the New York Police Department restricted Fifth Avenue's four-to-five traffic lanes to three under newly tightened presidential security.\n\n\"These findings validate what we've all heard in the news \u2014 traffic on Fifth Avenue has slowed to a crawl,\" said StreetLight founder and CEO Laura Schewel.\n\nExactly how slow has it been?\n\nNew Yorkers kvetching about worsening traffic has long rivaled similar complaints by residents of Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and other densely congested urban areas. Former New York City Transportation Commissioner Sam Schwartz regularly announced gridlock alerts when he held the job during the 1980s.\n\nIn the wake of the presidential election results, Schwartz, who now issues regular Gridlock Sam advisories online, on Tuesday said \"I would issue a gridlock alert for the next four years\" for Trump Tower and other nearby locations that bear the new president's name. They've become a magnet for traffic-clogging protests, as well as tourists, said Schwartz.\n\nTo quantify the problem, StreetLight obtained global positioning system data gathered from navigation systems in cars by INRIX, a global company with extensive data sets from connected device traffic units. StreetLight then used proprietary algorithms to transform the data into traffic patterns for analysis.\n\nA closer look at the data showed that the biggest new traffic issue near Trump Tower was a large jump in traffic inching ahead at speeds as low as 1 mile per hour, plus a total absence of vehicles traveling at speeds over 20 miles per hour. Both metrics represent major changes from the same period in 2015, the analysis found.\n\nThe slowed speeds and traffic jams represent an economic challenge for nearby stores, as well as the city itself.\n\nFamed luxury jewelry company Tiffany said last week ts 2016 year-end holiday sales were lower than anticipated, at least partly due to \"post-election traffic disruptions\" near the company's New York City flagship store \u2014 which abuts Trump Tower.\n\nTom Cusick, president of the Fifth Avenue Business Improvement District, told a Jan. 10 public hearing by the New York City Council's Committee on Economic Development that area businesses collectively have lost an estimated $40 million in revenue since Election Day due to tougher Trump Tower security.\n\n\"It is important to recognize that the world is watching what happens around Trump Tower, particularly along Fifth Avenue, which contributes much to the image of the city as an international marketplace, Kathryn Wylde, the president and CEO of business group Partnership for New York City said in prepared testimony for the hearing. \"New York businesses and residents well beyond the immediate area are affected by what happens here, not just in terms of cascading traffic problems, but the image of the city's style and magic.\"\n\nStreetlight's Schewel voiced hope that the company's analysis would help the city's civic leaders address the traffic snarl. \"We'll be checking in to see how the jam evolves over time, especially as New York drivers and policymakers make adjustments,\" she said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.38047552108765, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 708, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.11222595793, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.11864406779661, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/14/pink-cat-ear-hats-sweeping-nation-ahead-womens-march/96584374/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1348, "scraper_regex": 1253}}, "headline": "Pussyhat Project is sweeping nation ahead of the Women's March on Washington", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1253, "date": "20170114190000", "story_content": "Pink cat-ear hats are becoming the latest fashion trend among women across the country. So much so that it's sparked a run on pink yarn.\n\nThe sudden popularity in the shade is due to the Pussyhat Project, a national effort to flood the nation's capital with women wearing pink cat-ear hats at the Women's March on Washington on Jan. 21.\n\nThe project's goal is to make a visual statement on the first day of President-elect Donald Trump's administration to show that women stand united when it comes to protecting their rights, said the project's co-founder, Jayna Zweiman.\n\nIn response to the call to action, many crafters around the country are knitting, crocheting and sewing hats as quickly as they can to ensure those in Washington and at sister marches in cities across the country have the pink hats to wear.\n\nThe goal is to deliver 1 million hats to Washington, D.C., for distribution at the march. Women are making them for themselves, for their sisters or daughters and even for strangers, before dropping them off at pickup points around the country. Any shade of pink is OK, but hot pink seems to be the most popular.\n\n\"I think it's resonating a lot because we're really saying that no matter who you are or where you are, you can be politically active,\" said Zweiman, 38, of Los Angeles, who teamed up with her friend, 29-year-old Krista Suh, to launch the project in late November.\n\nAs soon as the Women's March on Washington was announced, Suh made plans to be there. But Zweiman is recovering from a concussion and can't participate in person. Together, they came up with a large-scale, national hat project to engage people \u2014 whether they're marching or supporting someone else who is \u2014 and launched a website.\n\n\"It's about the knitting, but it's also about so much more,\" Zweiman said. They used the term \"pussyhat\" for the project as a play on words referencing the way Trump bragged about groping unsuspecting women in a 2005 recording leaked during the presidential race.\n\n\"'P----' is a very charged word; I'm now very used to saying it, but it's interesting to hear people talk about the word, and how they feel about the word. These are conversations we all need to have. The discussions are around what is this word, what does it mean? A lot of it is constructive dialogue.\n\n\"In this era of really divisive politics and the news cycle is so pessimistic and gut-wrenching, people are rallying around being politically active and standing up for themselves ... This gives an opportunity for people to support the marchers and physically represent themselves at the march, and it's giving them warmth and support.\"\n\nVolunteer knitters have dropped off hats at Woven Art in East Lansing, Mich., to be given away free to anyone who is going to a women's march, said Meg Croft, who co-owns the yarn shop. The hope is that those who pick up a free hat might consider a donation to the American Civil Liberties Union or Planned Parenthood.\n\nMany women are concerned that Trump will make good on campaign promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act, defund Planned Parenthood and appoint U.S. Supreme Court justices who are against abortion rights.\n\n\"We have a big local demand, and being in a college town, we have a lot of people who are very concerned about the way things have been going recently,\" Croft said. \"We're in a fairly liberal county, so people are upset and very concerned that rights are going to disappear.\"\n\nCroft's favorite yarn for the hats is a hot pink, hand-dyed worsted-weight wool from Stonehedge Fiber Mill in East Jordan, Mich. But that particular yarn is sold out right now, she said.\n\nDebbie McDermott, who has owned Stonehedge Fiber Mill for 18 years and had her own wholesale line of Shepherd's Wool Yarn for a decade, said the hot pink shade has never been so popular.\n\n\"We don't usually sell a whole lot of that, and then all of a sudden, everybody wanted hot pink,\" said McDermott, whose Shepherd's Wool Yarn is sold in 300 stores nationally. \"There has been more demand. When yarn shops call and they need it right now, and you haven't sold that much of a color for the nine years you've been making it, no, you can't meet demand.\n\n\"We have a couple other pinks, but the hot pink is the one everybody's been wanting lately.\"\n\nSpun in Ann Arbor, Mich., also is out of McDermott's hot pink Shepherd's Wool Yarn, said co-owner Peter Sickman-Garner. But, he said, there's a zinnia pink that's also popular for the hats.\n\nHe said the rush for hot pink came out of nowhere.\n\n\"All of a sudden, it was everywhere,\" said Sickman-Garner. \"The knitting and crochet community is pretty tight, so when something is happening, word gets out pretty quickly.\n\n\"We've been getting all kinds of inquiries from people who want the hat and ask to learn how to make it... A lot of people are coming in to buy yarn for a friend who does know how to knit. A lot of people are knitting extra hats to bring to D.C.\"\n\nThe store is keeping a list of people who are interested in receiving a donated hat, and one employee offered to take extras with her to the march. But, Sickman-Garner said: \"I'm confident we won't have as many hats as we have people who've been asking for them.\"\n\nThe shop is even hosting a hat-knitting event.\n\n\"I've seen the estimates for the crowd. I think it's going to be a much, much bigger march than they're estimating,\" he said. \"They're going down from all over Michigan. I don't know that it's so much a red versus blue, as it is just a respect for sisters march.\"\n\nMarilyn Grazioli, who owns Ewe-nique Knits in Royal Oak, Mich., with her daughter Amy Goller, spent Tuesday afternoon calling customers who wanted hot pink yarn. The store had just received a new shipment of Maxima by Manos del Uruguay, a hand-dyed merino wool variety.\n\nAt Twisted Warp & Skeins in Merrill, Mich., co-owners Dale Blunk and Pam Hickey are giving away hats knitted by volunteers. And they're trying to collect donations of 200 hats for the women taking buses to the march.\n\nThough Blunk and Hickey can't attend the march, Blunk said the shop will be open Jan. 21 to anyone who might like to come in for coffee, camaraderie and to watch broadcasts or live-streaming of the event.\n\nAt Craft Raft Studio in Grand Rapids, Mich., about 15 people came together one night in early January to learn to knit their pink hats together, said Heather Robinson, whose husband, Jake Sleutel, owns the studio.\n\n\"It's normal people getting involved for once, which is so interesting to me,\" said Robinson, 42, of Grand Rapids. \"It's not outwardly 'protesty' \u2014 it's women standing up for what they believe in. It's kind of refreshing.\n\n\"You're just making a hat, you know? Who can object to that?\"\n\nThe studio is selling the hats for $25-$45, depending on the style. Any proceeds from sales will be donated to a nonprofit organization in Grand Rapids, and other hats are being donated to the march.\n\n\"I really feel this whole movement-project for me and Jake hasn't been about a rejection of the president-elect directly ... but more about what kind of world we want to be part of,\" Robinson said. \"We choose making as a way of spreading peace and kindness.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.6875, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1348, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.087661301680001, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170114190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.00296735905045, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/11/02/feds-approve-ys-diabetes-program-despite-drugmaker-opposition/93125138/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Feds approve Y's diabetes program despite drug maker opposition", "wordcount_as_scraped": 896, "date": "20161102210000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal regulators will move ahead with a national test of Medicare coverage for a YMCA diabetes prevention program over the objections of the pharmaceutical industry, which sells drugs including increasingly expensive insulin to treat disease.\n\nThe final rule, announced Wednesday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is designed to speed Medicare coverage of a program to combat a disease that a quarter of people 65 and older have. National trade associations representing hospitals and doctors enthusiastically supported CMS' plan in comments filed with the agency.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) trade group, however, said in its comments that CMS is setting a \"flawed precedent\" and acting upon only \"preliminary\" evidence. A federal contractor studied the program for at least two years and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) analyzed it for about 20 years before that.\n\nIn 2002, an independent safety board advising NIH said it would be unethical to withhold such an effective treatment from the placebo group in a study of 3,000 patients.\n\nWhen it comes to diabetes, time is money. Those on Medicare with diabetes cost the federal government nearly twice that of people who do not have the disease \u2014 or nearly $16,000 a year.\n\nThe Diabetes Prevention Program, now offered at about 1,000 Ys around the country, helped people at high risk of developing diabetes lose about 5% of their body weight \u2014 enough to substantially reduce their risk of developing diabetes. The program combines nutrition, fitness and lifestyle education over a four-month period.\n\nCMS hopes to expand the program, which starts January 2018, to more Ys and other groups certified by the CDC.\n\n\"I thought it was going to be one of the biggest home runs we were going to hit,\" says CMS Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt. \"Who could possibly be against preventing disease except for people who maybe manufacture drugs to fight disease?\"\n\nPhRMA spokeswoman Allyson Funk insists her group \"supports diabetes prevention efforts and the Diabetes Prevention Program.\" Drug makers have problems with how CMS is expanding the program, she says.\n\nPnRMA's comments, however, challenged several aspects of CMS' proposal, including that it would reduce spending and improve health care.\n\nThe program's expansion is being done on a sort of fast-track basis through CMS's Innovation Center, which was funded through the Affordable Care Act. The diabetes program is the first \"demonstration project\" to be approved for Medicare coverage. The traditional path to Medicare coverage would be a \"several year process,\" says Robert Ratner, a physician who was a contract investigator for NIH who began working on the diabetes program in the 1990s.\n\n\"All they (PhRMA) want to do is increase the bureaucratic process of getting this approved,\" says Ratner, now chief scientific and medical officer at the American Diabetes Association.\n\nWhen data show a test like this improves the quality of health care, \"we have the authority to expand it to the entire Medicare population,\" says Patrick Conway, a physician who heads innovation and quality at CMS. \"If the innovation center did not exist and we couldn't have done this test, this program may have never been available.\"\n\nWhen compared with similar people not in the diabetes program, CMS said the estimated savings of $2,650 for each person enrolled in the Diabetes Prevention Program over a 15-month period was more than enough to cover the cost of the program.\n\nAbout 30 million people in the United States now have type 2 diabetes, which leads to an average of two deaths every five minutes. Another 86 million are at high risk of developing diabetes, because one in every three adults have higher than normal blood glucose levels, known as prediabetes. Along with type 2 diabetes, people with prediabetes are at increased risk for developing heart disease and stroke. Many people with prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years.\n\nConversely, the American Medical Association noted that it was an early supporter of the diabetes program and partnered with the national Y to encourage doctors to refer patients to the program. That partnership was the basis for the certification by CMS' actuary that was cited in the proposed rule. The American Hospital Association also supported making the Medicare funding of the program permanent.\n\nAlthough EpiPens have been getting most of the drug pricing attention lately, insulin prices have done their own skyrocketing. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a former Democratic presidential candidate, tweeted a statistic from a Washington Post article this week that the price of Eli Lilly's Humalog insulin was up 700% in the last 20 years. The price Medicare paid for the insulin Lantus in 2014 \u2014 the most recent year available \u2014 went up 41% for a total cost of $1.7 billlion that year.\n\nEzekiel Emanuel, an oncologist who was health policy adviser at the White House as the ACA was drafted, says the diabetes program \"is exactly the kind of prevention program we should all want tested and expanded.\"\n\n\"Is the data perfect? No. But it is good and suggests savings in the thousands of dollars,\" says Emanuel. \"Do we need more research especially to improve the program even more? Yes...but the perfect should not be the enemy of the good. \"\n\nThe diabetes program is \"proven to improve quality of care. Improve health outcomes and lower costs.,\" says Conway. \"That is something we should all be for.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.47619047760963396, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 916, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.8719162616400005, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 7, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161102210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.49344978165939, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/27/fungal-meningitis-trial/97139690/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Doctor: Some victims of tainted drug face lingering, lifelong infections", "wordcount_as_scraped": 628, "date": "20170127200000", "story_content": "BOSTON \u2014 A physician who unknowingly injected dozens of his patients with a fungus-tainted steroid said some of the victims will be fighting lingering infections for the rest of their lives.\n\nFederal officials concluded that 17 patients at Michigan Pain Specialist clinics died as a result of being injected with methylprednisolone acetate contaminated with fungus, said Dr. Edward Washabaugh of Ann Arbor, Mich., testifying Wednesday in the federal court trial of Barry Cadden. The president and part owner of the New England Compounding Center, the Boston-based pharmacy that produced the steroids, was charged with racketeering and 25 counts of second-degree murder for his role in the deadly 2012 outbreak.\n\nFungal meningitis from the contaminated drug sickened about 750 people nationwide. Seventy-six people died in the outbreak, according to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigation.\n\n\n\n\nThe 15 jurors also heard testimony from a former compounding center employee, Owen Finnegan, who described how he and other workers switched labels on drug products to conceal the fact that components had expired. He described how unlabeled and undated drugs were stored in plastic bags within the compounding pharmacy's clean room to use when orders overwhelmed staff.\n\nWashabaugh said he first learned of the outbreak Oct. 3 from a message left on the clinic's voice mail the previous night.\n\nAt first, he said he didn't grasp how serious the situation was. He learned fast.\n\n\"By Oct. 5, two of my patients had died,\" Washabaugh said.\n\nAsked about his first telephone conversations with victims and their survivors, Washabaugh said his first call was to a patient who was sick and died two weeks later.\n\nThe clinic went into triage mode as the days passed, he said. First, on instructions from state and federal regulators, staff called all the patients who had received shots from the lot of drugs identified as the likely source.\n\nThe clinic had been shipped one of three suspect lots of methylprednisolone acetate.\n\nClinic staff tried to reach New England Compounding Center officials, but the calls went unanswered.\n\nThe apparent cases quickly began to multiply, and ultimately about 230 clinic patients were sickened there, Washabaugh said.\n\nDoctors at a special unit set up at a nearby hospital, St. Joseph Mercy Medical Center in Ann Arbor, were working double shifts performing spinal taps on patients to test for any traces of fungal meningitis. Some patients had to undergo multiple taps.\n\nIn addition to meningitis, Washabaugh said doctors were discovering that patients who had injections in joints, such as hips and knees, were suffering from abscesses caused from the compounding center's steroid.\n\n\"These were very painful,\" he said.\n\nThe infected patients were treated with powerful antifungal medicines that Washabaugh called the equivalent of chemo for cancer.\n\n\"These drugs are very, very harsh,\" he said.\n\nA Michigan Pain Specialist employee, Deborah Kushman, testified how the clinic became a New England Compounding customer. She said she saw a company display at a trade show in 2005 that described the pharmacy's state-of-the-art facilities and its compliance with the highest national sterility standards.\n\n\"I wanted to make sure it was what it said it was,\" she said, adding that she contacted a sales representative who assured her that New England Compounding drugs would only be shipped after they tested negative for the presence of endotoxins or micro-organisms\n\nAndrew Cordiale, a drug buyer from a Glens Falls, N.Y., hospital, said after his facility became a pharmacy customer, his staffers were instructed to include fake names for patients when submitting orders \u2014 pharmacies generally prepare medication on demand via prescription while hospitals want to have drugs on hand to use immediately as needed \u2014 and were told to make sure the names sounded legitimate.\n\n\"They just needed a name to fill it in, a name that sounded real enough,\" he said", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.42954874038696, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 651, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 4, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.2081741457299997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0721966205837203, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/01/01/obama-boosted-white-house-tech-trump-sees-risks/96063480/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 788, "scraper_regex": 742}}, "headline": "Trump really doesn't trust computers", "wordcount_as_scraped": 742, "date": "20170101220000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON - As Barack Obama began preparing to leave office, the first smartphone-toting U.S. president ordered his team to upgrade the White House's aging technology for his successor. New computers were purchased and faster internet was installed.\n\nNot included in the modernization plans? A courier service.\n\nBut that delivery method of a bygone era may be in for a comeback under Donald Trump. Despite his voracious use of Twitter, the president-elect appears to be leaning toward old tech to ensure the security of sensitive messages.\n\n\"It's very important, if you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way because I'll tell you what, no computer is safe,\" Trump told reporters Saturday in response to questions about Russia's alleged hacking of Democrats during the presidential election. Trump, who doesn't email or surf the internet, said days earlier that computers \"have complicated lives very greatly.\"\n\nTrump's skepticism of some technology marks a sharp contrast from the president he'll replace on Jan. 20. Obama, who was a youthful 47 years old when he took office, carries a specially outfitted Blackberry, emails with a small number of friends and aides, and has received some of his daily security briefings on an iPad. He celebrated technological innovations at an annual science fair, created the job of chief technology officer in the White House and viewed technology as key to making the sprawling federal government more efficient and responsive to the public.\n\nBut technology has also been a burden for Obama. Online sign-ups for his health care law were crippled by massive technical issues, resulting in one of the most embarrassing episodes of his presidency. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden stole classified information that he leaked to journalists, revealing the Obama administration's bulk collection of millions of Americans' phone records, as well as U.S. spying on some friendly foreign leaders.\n\nTrump, 70, rarely uses a computer and sifts through stacks of newspapers, magazines and printed articles to read the news. He panned candidates' reliance on data and technology in presidential campaigns, preferring to make decisions in part based on the reaction from audiences at his rallies. While Trump's tweetstorms are already legendary, he utters some of his messages out loud and leaves the actual typing to aides.\n\nIncoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he expects Trump to continue using Twitter and other social media sites as president, casting it as an effective way to communicate with Americans.\n\n\"Absolutely, you're going to see Twitter,\" Spicer said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I think it freaks the mainstream media out \u2014 that he has this following of 45-plus million people that follow him on social media\" and he \"can have a direct conversation\" with them.\n\nTrump has shown some interest in technology since winning the White House. Billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel has been working with Trump's transition team and could serve as an adviser to the administration. Trump met with several Silicon Valley executives last month, telling them his administration was \"here to help you folks do well.\"\n\nAs Trump heads into the White House, some of the biggest questions surrounding his relationship with technology will involve security. U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee and a top aide to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the election, exposing the vulnerabilities of systems in Washington. Revelations that Clinton used a personal email and private internet server during her four years as Obama's secretary of state highlighted the lax practices that exist in government.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump called for an immediate review of U.S. cyber defenses and vulnerabilities, though he has not detailed specific steps he plans to take to bolster cybersecurity and has not publicly accepted the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia was behind the election year hacking.

And President Obama's Department of Education seems like a good example.\n\nHigher education, after all, is one of the Democratic Party's biggest sources of support: Financial (according to Open Secrets, 4 of the top 10 organizations furnishing donors to the Obama 2012 campaign were universities: The University of California was #1, ahead of Google, and the others were Harvard, Stanford and Columbia), ideological (faculties lean far-left and the lefty faculty members tend to be much more outspoken, on average, than the conservative or libertarian faculty), and grassroots, with students, faculty and administrators serving as foot-soldiers (sometimes with university funding) for Democratic candidates and causes. And as Case Western University law professor George Dent notes, \"Most state colleges and universities now serve as political action committees for the left, and their political spending dwarfs that of all other PACs.\"\n\nSo you'd expect the Obama Department of Education to be doing whatever it could to nurture, support, and protect colleges and universities. But instead, it seems to be acting almost as if it were controlled by . . . a cabal of its enemies.\n\nFor example, in the area of Title IX enforcement Obama's Department of Education has taken a statute that simply reads: \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance,\" and turned it into an Orwellian nightmare of what Harvard law professors Jacob Gersen and Jeannie Suk call \"bureaucratic sex creep.\"\n\nAs a new book by KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor, Jr., The Campus Rape Frenzy, makes clear, the results have been bad for victimized students (almost always male), but they've also been bad for colleges and universities, producing horrible publicity, a growing number of expensive lawsuits, and increased trouble recruiting male students for what is increasingly becoming a pink-collar higher education system. This \"rape frenzy\" wasn't the product of anti-sex religious fundamentalists, but of hard-core gender-war feminists. And Obama has doubled down by, at the very last minute, appointing a new, hardline head for the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, which oversees this debacle. She can be expected to double down, unless Trump replaces her.\n\nAnd, in many other ways, the Department of Education's pro-diversity efforts have \u2014 entirely deliberately \u2014 fostered a climate of racial balkanization and division on campus. Again, the results have empowered a small number of student \"activists\" and administrators, but with destructive, and sometimes genuinely disastrous results. That's that case at the University of Missouri which has seen enrollments and donations plummet by astonishing amounts, genuinely disastrous results.\n\nMost recently, the Department of Education struck the Charlotte School of Law off the eligibility list for federal student aid, because of its graduates' low bar passage rate. That's pretty much a death blow. But why Charlotte, and why now?\n\nMuch of the hoopla about Trump education nominee Betsy DeVos has involved her views on K-12 education, though some critics have, absurdly, complained that her donation to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties outfit that has, among other things, opposed the Title IX kangaroo sex courts on many campuses, is somehow disqualifying. The critics fear that she'll reverse course on Obama's education program.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.3454158306121804, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 786, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.09892009983, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170116180000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.9440203562341, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/11/04/vote-democracy-world-war-veteran-air-force-column/93249462/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 780, "scraper_regex": 613}}, "headline": "Voting is a gift from our Founders: Norman Lear", "wordcount_as_scraped": 613, "date": "20161104150000", "story_content": "When I was sent overseas in World War II as the radio operator and top gunner on a B-17, we airmen were on a mission basis. In the 15th Air Force, flying out of Foggia, Italy, we often flew so many hours that some missions earned us double credit. When we'd flown 50 missions, our tour of duty was completed.\n\nHalfway through my tour the Air Force decided to put us on a sortie basis. That meant that we were credited with a mission only when we dropped bombs. To complete our tour on a sortie basis, we had to drop bombs 35 times. All in, my box score reads that I flew 52 missions and dropped bombs 35 times. As an American, of course I go with the larger figure, so when asked about my service, I say I flew 52 missions in World War II.\n\nWhat does that have to do with voting in this election, you may wonder. Everything, is the answer. We were in love with America when we were fighting World War II, \"The Big One,\" as it was generally called. I don't mean to imply that we don't love our country today, but I do wish to stress that we were IN love with our country then. When war was declared, we went from an easy does it, laid back culture to the war machine of all time, with just about every man, woman and late teen giving their all. No one had to sell us or motivate us to turn our lives over to the service of our country. It happened with the snap of a trigger finger because we were IN love with our country then.\n\nI don't think I fully grasped at the time just how many Americans were being cheated of their birthright and systematically denied access to equal opportunity and justice. I came home from Europe in one piece thanks in part to the Tuskegee Airmen, the black fighter pilots who overcame racism and segregation, flew protective escort for us, and compiled an exceptional wartime record. And yet after this extraordinary patriotic service, they returned to a country where many people treated them as less than equal, where the force of law was wielded to enforce an ideology of white supremacy that mocked the ideals for which they had fought so bravely.\n\nFortunately, our Founders established a society in which we, the citizenry, have the constitutional right to change our laws and our governing bodies to suit our needs. In the decades since we liberated Europe from fascism, Americans have transformed our own society. Our culture and laws have been changed by great activist movements that brought us successive waves of civil rights legislation and legal rulings for which we should all be grateful and proud.\n\nThere is even more for me to love about America now than there was when I dropped out of college to join the war effort. And so there is nothing more important to this 94-year old American than his vote. Next to that comes your vote.\n\nTurn a deaf ear to anyone who says \"What's one vote?\" It's a gift from our Founding Fathers, that's what! It's the legacy of countless Americans \u2014 those who fought and those who participated in nonviolent struggles \u2014 to preserve that precious right for you.\n\nEvery vote cast is a contribution to a sane world.

His opponents will likely portray him as governing in unprecedented and reckless ways. The best response to such charges is to open the books and expose how the Obama administration commandeered far more power than most Americans realized.\n\nTrump should follow the excellent precedent set by President Obama. In 2009, shortly after he took office, Obama released many of the secret Bush administration legal memos that explained why the president was supposedly entitled to order torture, deploy troops in American towns and cities, and ignore the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on warrantless, unreasonable searches. The disclosures signaled a new era in Washington and helped give Obama a reputation as a champion of civil liberties.\n\nTurnabout is fair play. Trump should quickly reveal the secret memos underlying Obama's \"targeted killing\" drone assassination program.\n\nAdministration lawyers defeated lawsuits by the ACLU, The New York Times, and others seeking disclosure of key legal papers on how the president became judge, jury and executioner. A Trump administration could disclose the memos and white papers without endangering anything other than the reputation of the soon-to-be former president and his policymakers.\n\nOpening the files at the Pentagon, CIA, and State Department on U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War would vindicate Trump's warnings on the campaign trail to plunging deeper into that morass. Pentagon-backed Syrian rebels have openly battled CIA-backed rebels. The U.S. has armed and bankrolled Al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria despite federal law prohibiting providing material support to terrorist groups. Americans deserve to see the bureaucratic smoking guns on this fiasco.\n\nTrump should also reveal the paper trail preceding and following the U.S. bombing of Libya in 2011. Former secretary of State Hillary Clinton labeled the U.S. attack on Libya as \"smart power at its best\" but that nation has been in chaos ever since the U.S. joined an assault commenced by France and Britain. What did the U.S. government know and when did it know it regarding the likely effects of toppling Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi?\n\nLaying out the record could help prevent similar follies in the future. It is naive to assume that \"truth will out\" from federal bureaucracies.\n\nIt is vital for a Trump White House to compel disclosures because the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has become largely a mirage. While Obama boasted of \"the most transparent administration in history,\" federal agencies slammed the door on routine requests \u2014 especially from the media. The Associated Press reported in 2015 that the Obama administration \"set a record again for censoring government files or outright denying access to them\" under FOIA. Federal agencies were also hit by a record number of lawsuits contesting FOIA denials in 2015.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton had won the presidency, some people would have blamed the State Department's \"slow walking\" of FOIA requests for her emails (which she improperly kept on a private server). The FBI worked through 650,000 emails from Anthony Weiner's computer in eight days but the State Department claimed it needed 75 years to fully answer a FOIA request on Hillary Clinton's aides' emails. A federal judge and the agency's inspector general slammed its FOIA stonewalling.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security also has a dreadful FOIA record; the agency permitted political appointees to stifle FOIA responses in a process that \"reeks of a Nixonian enemies list,\" California Republican Darrell Issa said when he was chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Under Obama, the Transportation Security Administration, part of the DHS, became far more intrusive and abusive, launching \"enhanced patdowns\" that, as USA TODAY noted, \"require screeners to touch passengers' breasts and genitals.\" The TSA conceals almost all information over its groping (which has caught zero terrorists, or else we would have heard about it a hundred times) with a \"sensitive security information\" FOIA designation that justifies perpetual secrecy. Exposing TSA coverups and reining in the agency would create a bounty of early good will for the Trump administration.\n\nTrump's promise to end and replace the Affordable Care Act would be greatly assisted by releasing the memos behind Obama's endless \"fixes\" to that law. For instance, a van-load of senior IRS financial managers were summoned in 2014 to the Old Executive Office Building and only permitted a peak at a secret Office of Management and Budget memo explaining why the Obama administration was entitled to spend $3.9 billion on subsidies for consumer health insurance. As The New York Times reported last year, the IRS officials \"were told they could read it but could not take notes or make copies. The OMB officials left the room to allow their visitors a moment to absorb the document, and then returned to answer a few questions.\" Federal judge Rosemary Collyer recently slammed the administration's actions as unconstitutional.\n\nMany sweeping regulations have lately been rushed into law with shaky rationales or scant evidence. Obama relied on \"bureaucratic bulldozing rather than legislative transparency,\" according to The New York Times, issuing 50% more \"major regulations\" than the George W. Bush administration. The Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies have been scandalized by switcheroos to suppress information federal law required them to disclose. Opening the books would be especially helpful for the torrent of midnight edicts the Obama team has issued in recent months.\n\nRecent polls show that fewer than 20% of Americans now trust the federal government. Excessive secrecy spurs many Americans to presume that their rulers are up to no good. Regardless of the policies that Trump chooses, it would be a booster shot for democracy to reveal the back story of the Obama era.\n\nJames Bovard, author of Public Policy Hooligan, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

While some early tumors turn into deadly monsters, others stop growing or even shrink. But assuming that all small breast lesions have the potential to turn deadly is akin to \"racial profiling,\" Brawley wrote in his editorial.\n\n\"By treating all the cancers that we see, we are clearly saving some lives,\" Brawley said in an interview. \"But we're also 'curing' some women who don't need to be cured.\"\n\nAlthough experts such as Brawley have long discussed the risks posed by \"overdiagnosis,\" relatively few women who undergo cancer screenings are even aware of the debate.\n\nThe American College of Radiology, which strongly supports breast cancer screenings, acknowledges that mammograms lead some women to be treated unnecessarily but said the problem is much less common than the new study suggests. Another study from Denmark \u2013 whose national health program keeps detailed records \u2013 estimated the overdiagnosis rates at only 2.3%.\n\n\"The amount of overdiagnosis really is small,\" said Dr. Debra Monticciolo, chair of the American College of Radiology's Commission on Breast Imaging. \"Articles like this aren't very helpful,\" she said, because they leave women confused about how to be screened for breast cancer.\n\nYet treating women for cancer unnecessarily can endanger their health, said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group. Radiation can damage the heart or even cause new cancers. Visco notes that breast cancer activist Carolina Hinestrosa, a vice president at the coalition, died at age 50 from soft-tissue sarcoma, a tumor caused by radiation used to treat an early breast cancer.\n\nWomen should understand these risks, Visco said. Instead, women often hear only about mammograms' benefits.\n\n\"Women have been inundated with the early detection message for decades,\" Visco said.\n\nThe risks of overdiagnosis and false positives, which can lead women with benign growths to undergo biopsies and other follow-up tests, have caused some experts to re-evaluate breast cancer screenings. Although mammograms don't find all tumors, they reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by 25% to 31% for women ages 40 to 69, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, part of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMedical groups now offer differing advice on mammograms:\n\nIn the new study, Danish researchers estimated the rate of overdiagnosis by comparing the number of early-stage and advanced breast tumors before and after the country started offering mammograms. If screenings work as intended, the number of small, curable breast tumors should increase, while reducing the number of large cancers by about the same amount.\n\nAlthough mammograms in Denmark detected a lot more breast cancers, these were mostly small, early-stage tumors, said study co-author Dr. Karsten Jorgensen, a researcher at the Nordic Cochrane Center in Copenhagen, Denmark. The number of advanced cancers did not fall.\n\nThe debate about overdiagnosis illustrates the limits of medical technology, Brawley said.\n\nAlthough researchers can estimate the statistical rate of overdiagnosis, doctors treating actual patients can't definitively tell which breast tumors need treatment and which might be safely ignored, Brawley said. So doctors tend to err on the side of caution and treat all breast cancers with surgery and, in many cases, radiation and chemotherapy.\n\nAn estimated 253,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in U.S. women this year, with nearly 41,000 deaths, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nAn additional 63,000 women will be diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, also known as DCIS, which has some, but not all, of the typical traits of cancer. Although DCIS cells have changed to appear malignant under the microscope, they haven't invaded surrounding tissue.\n\nThe American Cancer Society defines DCIS as the earliest stage of breast cancer, and women with the condition typically undergo the same treatment given to women with early invasive cancers. Although DCIS isn't life-threatening, doctors recommend treating it to prevent it from becoming invasive.\n\nOther experts note that DCIS carries such low risk that it should be considered merely a risk factor for cancer. Researchers are conducting studies to measure whether it's safe to scale back treatment of DCIS.\n\nThis story comes from Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.196581363677981, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 855, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.22680885708, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170109230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.7543859649122802, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/nation-now/2017/01/03/bird-collisions-radio-tv-cellphone-towers/96106338/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 946, "scraper_regex": 896}}, "headline": "Flashing lights work better than steady ones to keep birds from hitting towers", "wordcount_as_scraped": 896, "date": "20170103180000", "story_content": "Research from the Michigan field office of a federal agency is helping save the lives of songbirds \u2014 and also could save money for communications tower operators.\n\nAn estimated 7 million birds are killed annually in tower collisions across the USA, and most are songbirds that migrate at night. More than a decade ago staff at the East Lansing field office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service coordinated hundreds of researchers across the state to count the number of injured and dead songbirds at the base of 24 communications towers during the peak of the birds' spring and fall migrations.\n\nThey concluded that towers with steadily burning lights were more deadly to the birds than towers with flashing lights, and that by simply turning off the steady lights they could reduce deadly bird-tower collisions by 70%.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration changed its lighting standards for new communication towers in December 2015 while the Fish and Wildlife Service recently began working to persuade owners and operators of existing towers across Michigan to turn off the burning lights or switch to flashing lights.\n\nThe lights are meant to protect aircraft from striking these towers.\n\nThe country has thousands of these towers that broadcasters, communications and telecommunications providers use. Only newly built towers are affected, and replacing or turning off the burning lights is voluntary for existing tower owners.\n\nOwners of towers that have both steady and sufficient flashing lights simply can extinguish the steady lights. Experts say that could save owners money on maintenance and power costs.\n\nAudubon Great Lakes, the Chicago-based office of the National Audubon Society, said it's willing to use its chapter network across the Great Lakes to reach out to tower owners and operators about switching or turning off lights. Work could begin this year.\n\n\"We're really pleased we had an opportunity to do something that has nationwide implications for migratory birds,\" said Jack Dingledine, deputy field supervisor at the wildlife service's East Lansing field office.\n\nIt all started in 1998 when the Fish and Wildlife Service learned Michigan had plans to build a telecommunications network of 179 towers.\n\n\"We had some concerns about the potential impact of those towers on migratory birds, including the endangered Kirtland's warbler,\" which nests almost exclusively in northern Michigan, Dingledine said.\n\nThe agency approached the state, asking for access to the base of the towers so researchers could measure the number of dead birds as they migrated between Michigan and the southern U.S., Central America and South America. The state also provided more than $100,000 for the research.\n\nLed by Joelle Gehring, who was working on a post-doctorate at Central Michigan University at the time, researchers did pilot work at six towers in fall 2003. In the fall and spring of 2004 and 2005, for three weeks at a time, they counted dead birds at 24 towers from southwest Michigan to the Upper Peninsula.\n\nGehring and two colleagues published their study in a scientific journal in 2009, and the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates tower lighting, did its own research to ensure aircraft would still be safe if the steady lights were turned off or replaced.\n\nWhile the Federal Communications Commission licenses communications towers, it requires owners and operators to comply with standards set by the FAA.\n\nDingledine said researchers have discovered some evidence that the birds may be attracted to lights on the tower, especially in foggy weather, and then they collide with the tower or the wires that support the structure.\n\n\"The light can confuse them when they migrate,\" he said.\n\nBut scientists aren't exactly sure why the steady lights are more dangerous than blinking lights.\n\n\"Birds are a harbinger of the health of your ecosystem\" so protecting these migrating songbirds is important, Dingledine said. \"They are some of the most diverse species on earth, occur in every region of the planet and a good, healthy bird population means you have a good, healthy natural environment.\"\n\nCaleb Putnam, Michigan bird conservation coordinator for Audubon Great Lakes and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, called the Michigan research \"one of the most important bird-mortality-reducing research done in recent memory.\"\n\nBird experts have tried for years to address the issue, and Gehring was able to \"make a difference over thousands of towers,\" he said. \"It's such a common-sense solution to a huge problem.\"\n\nPutnam was one of the technicians who got up at dawn for three weeks straight to count dead birds at the base of a 1,100-foot-tall communications tower in southwest Michigan. The workers had to get to the site before daybreak, so they could find the birds before raccoons and other scavengers got them.\n\n\"We found birds alive, with their beaks broken off,\" Putnam said. On some days, he'd find 10 to 20 dead or injured warblers. But if the birds hadn't migrated the night before, he wouldn't find any. And it wasn't easy spotting them in the tall grass that surrounded much of the tower.\n\n\"The challenge is that most of our songbird populations are in decline,\" he said. \"Many of these species are lacking habitat in breeding areas, and as they get into the tropics, there is deforestation, coffee plantations, climate issues, all these other pressures on them.\n\n\"To not allow these species to migrate successfully twice a year, especially with this level of mortality, it starts to become a population-changing pressure,\" Putnam said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.385728061199188, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 946, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.12811827892, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170103180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.11416490486258, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/20/9-year-old-girl-killed/96829426/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Aunt: Girl slain ran behind dad 'instead of running away'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1051, "date": "20170120180000", "story_content": "CINCINNATI \u2014 A 9-year-old girl was killed as her father struggled with a gunman who had stormed into their house in a neighborhood near downtown.\n\nAlexandrea Thompson's father, Alex Thompson, tried to grab the gun Wednesday and several gunshots went off, said her aunt, Andrea Thompson. He was shot in the hand, arm and abdomen.\n\nA bullet that may have gone through her father's body struck Alexandrea in the chest, her aunt said.\n\n\"She was behind her dad. She was probably scared,\" Andrea Thompson said. \"She ran behind him instead of running away.\"\n\nAlexandrea's 15-year-old sister went to the home's third floor, where the shooting happened. She picked up Alexandrea, who was bleeding and \"breathing real hard,\" and cradled her, the aunt said.\n\n\"She took her last breath in her sister's arms,\" Andrea Thompson said.\n\nThe killing of the fourth-grader \u2014 described Thursday as an extremely bright leader at the charter school she attended \u2014 left her family devastated and her Mount Auburn neighborhood shaken.\n\nAt Mount Auburn International Academy, students, faculty and staff struggled to understand how their classmate, the little girl with the big grin who gave strong hugs, will never come to school again. The school is blocks away from where the shooting happened.\n\nClaudia Ehrle, the school's interim director, called Alexandrea a natural leader: \"She led by example.\"\n\nAlexandrea, who was known as \"Sissy,\" was the kid who immediately welcomed Ehrle when she came to the school this past November.\n\n\"You know when you start in a new place and some people just stand out? She was one of those,\" Ehrle said. \"My lasting memory of her will be that hug and that smile. She made me feel welcome.\"\n\nA green poster board that her classmates, and staff, signed after learning of her death echoed those sentiments:\n\n\u2022 \"Rest up baby, I love you sissy.\"\n\nThat board, along with several balloons, will be placed in the school's central hall near a bulletin board where Alexandrea's art is on display, Ehrle said.\n\nThe girl's hand-drawn art shows she was into superheroes and girl power. She wanted to grow up to be a teacher, loved steak and \"chilli,\" cheetahs, pottery and Johnny Depp. In the middle of the board was a simple, stick-figure drawing of her family \u2014 each figure neatly labeled in case you didn't know.\n\nGrief counselors were at the school Thursday for any of its 431 students who needed to talk. It was not lost on Ehrle and other staff that the shooting might be a trigger for some children who have experienced violence in their short lives.\n\nSome students opted to leave school for the day.\n\nAlexandrea was pronounced dead at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Her father was taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center and was in intensive care Thursday, said his mother, Catherine Thompson.\n\nShe described her granddaughter as a \"vibrant\" and \"very bright\" girl who liked to draw and excelled in school.\n\n\"She was a very sweet, adorable child,\" Catherine Thompson said. \"She was so adorable.\"\n\nAlexandrea had spent the weekend at her aunt's house rollerskating, watching movies and going out to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory.\n\n\"She had the time of her life,\" Andrea Thompson said. \"That's the only reason I'm holding up.\"\n\nHomicides are not rare but also not a constant plague in Alexandrea's neighborhood. Crime statistics for Cincinnati Police District 4, which patrols Mount Auburn and nine other neighborhoods, show no killings in 2016 but an average of more than one a year for the past three years. Thefts, robberies and aggravated assaults are more common.\n\nIn the first two weeks of 2017, the city had four homicides compared to half that for the same period in 2016. Last year's total was 66, a rate of 22.1 deaths per 100,000 population.\n\nIn comparison, the city of Memphis, more than double Cincinnati's size and experiencing its worse year for homicides ever in 2016 with 228, had a rate of 34.8 per 100,000. Chicago, with its worst tally in two decades at 746 killed, had a rate of about 27.4 deaths.\n\nIt was unclear who answered the door, but Andrea Thompson said the men forced their way inside.\n\nPolice said at least three men were seen leaving the home. Witnesses said the men were seen leaving in a white two-door car that was possibly a convertible.\n\nThe Rev. Peterson Mingo and other outreach workers with the city's Office of Human Relations were at the scene of the shooting Thursday and spoke with relatives. As is common practice, they were working to identify if anyone knew who was involved in the shooting.\n\nNeighbor Freeman McNeal watched Alexandrea grow up since the family moved in across the street from him six or seven years ago. And Thursday afternoon, while standing on his front porch, he said he was looking forward to watching her grow into a young adult.\n\n\"She was spontaneous, and she was the child who always did the right thing,\" McNeal said. \"She was full of light.\"\n\nFreeman, who to many is the patriarch of the block, said Alexandrea was like part of his family.\n\nFreeman shook his head and looked across the street as passersby continued to put candles and notes on a growing makeshift memorial on the steps of the home where she lived.\n\n\"God took a good one in her,\" he said.\n\nLess that 24 hours after Alexandrea and her father were shot, a crowd marched up the street to their home demanding residents come forward with information.\n\n\"It's time for us to take a stand and quit playing with this,\" said Rashid Abdullah with the Cincinnati Human Relations Commission. \"I know it's hard when it's your child that's pulling the trigger, but we know you didn't raise him like that.\"\n\nThe Rev. Alvin Scales with the First Church of God in Cincinnati announced that his church will offer $2,000 toward a reward for information leading to an arrest in the slaying. Other faith leaders have joined in the effort and hope to raise at least $9,000 for the reward, $1,000 for each year of Alexandrea's life.\n\n\"To the people who took this baby's life, you better turn yourself in and try to get as much mercy as you can get,\" said Peggy Harris with Who Killed Our Kids, stomping in anger.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 21, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.67364013195038, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1080, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.2271068325600005, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170120180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.7037037037037, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/22/chattanooga-school-bus-crash-know/94309352/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 890, "scraper_regex": 836}}, "headline": "Fatal Chattanooga school bus crash: What we know", "wordcount_as_scraped": 836, "date": "20161123020000", "story_content": "NASHVILLE \u2014 A dozen elementary school students were injured and five were killed in a school bus crash Monday afternoon in Chattanooga. The driver of the bus, 24-year-old Johnthony Walker, was arrested and faces five counts of vehicular homicide, among other charges. Here's what we know:\n\nWhere did it happen? \n\nThe crash took place about 3:20 p.m ET off Talley Road in the Brainerd area of southeast Chattanooga after the bus flipped and struck a tree.\n\n \n\nWho was killed? \n\nFive students \u2014 three fourth-graders, a kindergartner and a first-grader \u2014 were killed in the crash.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWho was injured? \n\nTwelve children remained hospitalized Tuesday morning. Of those, six remained in intensive care, Hamilton County Interim Superintendent Kirk Kelly said. The remaining 20 students, he said, were home with their families.\n\nIt took hours for medical personnel to identify the children, according to Dr. Darvey Koller, a pediatric emergency room physician at Children's Hospital at Erlanger in Chattanooga. At a Tuesday afternoon briefing, he described the wave of children in school uniforms who arrived at the hospital, many of them too young to know how to spell their own names or remember their birth dates. Even the children who could have remembered identifying information were dazed and frightened, he said.\n\nWhen asked to recall a parent's name, one child responded, \"Mama,\" Koller said.\n\nA staff member began taking photos of each child and showing them to teachers who could then tell doctors their names.\n\nDr. Lisa Smith, a pediatric surgeon, said at one point there were some 800 family members in the hospital halls and waiting rooms. She wanted to thank all of the emergency responders and hospital staff who helped treat the patients and care for their families.\n\nWho was arrested? \n\nPolice arrested 24-year-old Johnthony Walker, and are charging him with five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving. Chattanooga Police Chief Fred Fletcher said there may be additional charges later. Police said the bus driver is cooperating with authorities.\n\nWho did the bus driver work for? \n\nWalker worked for Durham School Services based in Warrenville, Ill. The company released a statement on Tuesday stating it was working with the Hamilton County School District and Chattanooga police on the investigation. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, Walker received his commercial driver's license in April.\n\nThe company operates across the nation and has more than 13,000 vehicles and 13,000 drivers, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Durham has had 142 crashes with injuries and three fatalities in the last 24 months, according to federal records. Records show at least 36 crashes with injuries and one wreck with a fatality in Tennessee during that span, including two crashes with injuries in Hamilton County this year.\n\npic.twitter.com/sZL0M2OQmJ\u2014 Durham School Svcs (@DurhamSchoolSvc) November 22, 2016\n\nWhat about the bus? \n\nNational Transportation and Safety Board Chairman Christopher Hart said the 2008 bus did not have seat belts and the agency is looking into whether they might have made a difference. \"It is too early to determine that this point,\" Hart said.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers are considering new legislation to require seat belts on school buses in Tennessee.\n\nHas the driver been in trouble before in Tennessee? \n\nAccording to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, Walker had no criminal offenses in the state until the bus crash. According to the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security, Walker had his license suspended for about a month in 2014 for failure to show proof of insurance in Chattanooga. His license was reinstated March 28, 2014.\n\nHas the driver been in another school bus crash?\n\nYes. Chattanooga police spokeswoman Elisa Myzal said Walker sideswiped a Kia Soul while driving a school bus in the city on Sept. 20. Myzal said Walker was travelling west on Sylvan Drive when he reportedly failed to yield and the crash took place. No one was injured and neither drugs nor alcohol appeared to have been a factor in the wreck.\n\nWhat did the driver say after the crash? \n\nWalker's mother, Gwenevere Cook, told CNN that her son called her after the crash and said he \"tried to pull the children off the bus.\" But, Cook said he told her, \"there was too much blood.\"\n\nWho is investigating? \n\nChattanooga police, the Hamilton County District Attorney's office, the Tennessee Highway Patrol and the NTSB.\n\nWhat caused the accident?\n\nEarly reports from investigators indicate the bus hit a utility pole before flipping over and wrapping around a tree. Authorities said speed is being investigated as a factor. Police have issued a warrant to remove the black box from the bus and review the video evidence. Police are still investigating whether alcohol played a role.\n\nWhere did the children go to school?\n\nThe children on the bus attend Woodmore Elementary School in the Brainerd/Woodmore community. The school, which opened in 1955, is located about six miles east of downtown Chattanooga.\n\nHow can you help the families?\n\nText the word \"Woodmore\" to the number 91-999 to give from your mobile phone.

All the others.\n\nAnd now, Donald John Trump.\n\nLove him or hate him, the 70-year-old New York businessman \u2014 the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president of the United States \u2014 has won a place in the history books. From the beginning, he was underestimated and scorned by many. He proved us wrong. I, for one, congratulate him. The plate of crow that I am eating does not taste good.\n\nTrump will be the leader not just of our country but of the free world. Ten weeks from now, he will take the helm at a time of enormous challenge and change. Our problems are many and they are complex. But so are our opportunities.\n\nTrump comes to the presidency with no political experience, no legislative experience and next to no discernible knowledge of foreign affairs. He reads little of substance, shows no curiosity and says he's smarter than generals, scientists, economists \u2014 anyone with decades of hard-earned experience in just about any discipline of importance that you can name. He hasn't a shred of humility and has shown to be as self-disciplined as an excited child tearing into his presents on Christmas morning. Yet on Jan. 20, this man will be entrusted with making split-second, life-and-death decisions and protecting 325 million Americans.\n\nIn this respect, Trump could not be any more different than the presidents mentioned at the top of this article. Of this distinction, his supporters seem neither to know nor care.\n\nOver the course of this campaign \u2014 from the announcement he was running (with actors paid to cheer him) to his final campaign stop in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Monday, he never made the pivot to \"acting presidential\" that his enablers and the man himself promised. Men who are in their eighth decade on this planet, who surround themselves with sycophants and have never been told \"no,\" don't change. The Trump we saw on the campaign trail is likely the Trump we're about to see in the Oval Office and the Situation Room.\n\nHe'll take an oath to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" \u2014 after spending a year and a half talking about watering it down in whatever ways are convenient.\n\nHe'll be expected to visit the scenes of the many mass shootings, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and assorted mayhem that will surely come. He'll be expected to comfort widows and children and show empathy. If he doesn't visit a disaster scene, he'll be criticized. If he doesn't visit within a certain amount of time, he'll be criticized. If he stays only a short while, he'll be criticized. If 20 schoolchildren are slaughtered in their classroom two weeks before Christmas, you go. What if \"only\" three are? And how much does all this cost the taxpayers, anyway? Everything \u2014 everything \u2014 will be second-guessed.\n\nHe'll be expected to show up at Arlington National Cemetery every Memorial Day, every Veterans Day, lay a wreath and make a solemn speech about valor and sacrifice. On the way back to the White House, he'll be expected to stop at Section 60 \u2014 final resting place for heroes from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and hug (careful there) a grieving mom or dad. He'll be expected to travel to nearby Walter Reed military hospital several times a year to visit wounded servicemembers and their families.\n\nPeople with struggles he has never faced will bombard him with thousands of heartfelt letters and emails. Some writers will complain. Some will beg for help. Others, lonely and afraid, write because they have nowhere else to go. Past presidents have asked that some of this correspondence be given to them (President Obama is given 10 letters a day). It helps keep them grounded and in touch with people beyond the bubble\n\nTrump will find that taking a few hours off to recharge \u2014 essential for all presidents \u2014 will be blasted by opponents. They'll ask why he isn't spending more time in the Oval Office doing his job. But then when he's in the Oval office doing his job, they won't like the job he's doing.\n\nThings will happen on the other side of the world in the middle of the night that may require immediate attention. Foreign leaders who don't like us \u2014 or him \u2014 will try to take advantage. They'll have agendas of their own that will collide, perhaps violently, with what he wants to do. He's an impulsive, rash man who will now have to be calm and deliberate.\n\nWe must wish him well.

Wade", "wordcount_as_scraped": 691, "date": "20170117210000", "story_content": "The abortion rate in the U.S. has dipped to its lowest level since the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 decision that legalized the procedure nationwide, a survey released Tuesday finds.\n\nThe 2014 figure was also down 14% from the 16.9 abortions per 1,000 women reported in a 2011 Guttmacher survey. About 926,200 abortions were performed nationwide in 2014, the report found, compared with 1.06 million abortions in 2011.\n\nBetter birth control is a key to the declining number of abortions, says Megan Donovan, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute. \"The primary driver behind the decline was most likely improved contraceptive use, which leads to fewer unintended pregnancies,\" she says. \"This is good news because it suggests women are increasingly able to access the resources they need to plan their families and avoid unintended pregnancy.\"\n\nFor abortion opponents, the numbers indicate a different benchmark, says Randall O'Bannon, director of education and research for the National Right to Life Educational Trust Fund. \"Though we've still quite a ways to go to restoring full legal and moral respect for the unborn, this is a critical milestone, getting below 1 million abortions for the first time since 1975.\"\n\nBeyond contraception and laws limiting abortion access, O'Bannon says his group believes a societal shift may be in play. \"One element that may not be getting its due is the increasing sense among Americans that abortion is a no real solution for mothers, for their babies, or for society in general.\"\n\nIn June, the court delivered its most consequential ruling on abortion in years, striking down restrictions on Texas clinics and doctors that threatened to prevent thousands of women from obtaining abortions. The court ruled 5-3 that a Texas law imposed undue hardships on women without sufficient health benefits. The restrictions threatened to close all but nine clinics and could have left the state unable to handle an estimated 65,000 to 70,000 abortions a year.\n\nDonovan acknowledges that state abortion restrictions may have played a role in the survey's findings. Such restrictions include parental notification laws, 24-hour waiting periods and bans on abortions after six or 12 weeks.\n\n\"Between 2011 and 2014, over 200 abortion restrictions were passed in the states, an unprecedented attack on abortion rights following the 2010 midterm elections,\" she says. She singles out what are known as TRAP (targeted regulation of abortion provider) laws \u2014 standards abortion rights advocates say are arbitrary and aimed at closing abortion clinics.\n\nBut she notes that 28 states and Washington, D.C., did not have new abortion restrictions in place \"and together they account for 62% of the decline\" in the findings. \"This indicates that something else is driving the decline, and the most likely explanation is improved contraceptive use.\"\n\nBoth abortion rights supporters and abortion foes are girding for a new administration \u2014 and potential new battlegrounds.\n\n\"Our hope for President-elect Trump is that he will appoint pro-life judges, and that the Congress will pass and the courts will approve measures that offer greater protection to the unborn and will reduce these numbers even further,\" National Right to Life President Carol Tobias says.\n\nDonovan says abortion rights groups are prepping for a reality in which abortion and contraception are harder to access. \"Rolling back policies that allow women to manage their reproductive health will have profound consequences, especially for low-income women, women of color and young people,\" Donovan says.\n\nShe notes that an earlier institute study found 75% of abortion patients in 2014 were low-income. In addition to cost barriers, these women can have a harder time overcoming associated obstacles when seeking an abortion: leave from work, child care, travel arrangements. \"For women who are already struggling to get by, accessing abortion services can be particularly challenging,\" she says.\n\nOther highlights of the report released Tuesday:\n\n\u2022 19% of pregnancies (excluding miscarriages) in 2014 ended in abortion.\n\n\u2022 More than half of all U.S. abortion patients in 2014 were in their 20s; 12% were adolescents.\n\n\u2022 Whites accounted for 39% of abortion procedures in 2014; blacks 28%; Hispanics 25%; other races and ethnicities 9%.\n\n\u2022 The number of clinics providing abortion services declined 6% \u2014 from 839 to 788 \u2014 from 2011 to 2014.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.62977075576782, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 850, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.4112114616900002, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117210000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.88235294117647, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/26/holocaust-survivor-told-story-thousands-students/97075714/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Holocaust survivor told story to thousands of students", "wordcount_as_scraped": 825, "date": "20170126080000", "story_content": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 Jack Marcus could have died on the day in 1939 when the Nazis rounded up all the Jews in his hometown in Poland and executed everyone.\n\nBut Marcus was a survivor \u2014 one of the few Jews still alive in Europe at the end of the war \u2014 and he dedicated his life to telling others his story.\n\n\"He went from being afraid of being caught by the Nazis to feeling very committed to the world knowing this story,\" said his son, Leonard Marcus.\n\nMarcus, 93, died Tuesday in Milwaukee.\n\nBefore he was Jack Marcus, he was Prisoner 144346. And before his left forearm was tattooed by the Nazis, he was Itzek Markowski, a boy growing up in the small town of Radziejow, northwest of Warsaw. On the day German soldiers came, his mother gave him a small bag of food and told him to flee. Marcus initially refused but relented at his mother's insistence.\n\n\"You can imagine how painful it was for her to push her only son out, but she wanted him to have a future,\" said Leonard Marcus.\n\nAn only child, 15-year-old Marcus hid in a haystack. His parents and the rest of the Jews in his town were loaded into specially outfitted trucks with engine exhaust piped into the back. They were driven around until everyone was asphyxiated. They were buried in a mass grave.\n\nMarcus realized the only way to survive was to work, so he went to a labor camp in Poland. When the Nazis built the giant camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Marcus was sent to work there. One day while working in a steel plant, a heavy girder fell on his foot. Marcus was taken to the camp hospital where one of his toes was amputated.\n\n\"Ten days in, the doctor came to him and said you only get 14 days in the hospital. If you're still here after 14 days, they come and take you to the crematoria,\" Leonard Marcus said.\n\nMarcus went back to work, hobbling 2 miles each day from his spartan living quarters to the work site, eating a bowl of weak soup in the morning and evening and a piece of bread at noon.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne morning, Marcus was walking to work when he saw his uncle arriving at Auschwitz. He was thrilled to see his uncle from afar and later that day excitedly searched for him in his quarters. To his horror, he found only his uncle's clothes and Marcus knew his uncle had been gassed immediately upon arrival.\n\nAs the war was winding down in the winter of 1945, Marcus and hundreds of other laborers from Auschwitz were put on an open coal train and spent days traveling from Poland to Germany with no food or shelter from the brutal cold.\n\nThe train stopped occasionally, and bodies of people who died from the cold and starvation were tossed off. One day Marcus saw a shivering boy ask a Nazi guard if he could get a coat from the body of one of the dead men thrown from the train.\n\n\"My dad watched this young boy jump off the train and get a coat from a pile of bodies. A soldier went up to him and shot him in the back. My dad said, 'That's when I gave up hope,' \" Leonard Marcus said.\n\nLater, when the train stopped in another town, someone threw a loaf of bread at Marcus' train car. But the bread fell on the tracks. He knew if he jumped off to get the bread he would be killed, his son said. But by then he no longer cared. He threw the loaf up to the people in his train car. Instead of killing Marcus, a guard beat him and told him to get back on the train. The bread was gone by the time he clambered aboard, but Marcus told his son he got something else. He got his humanity back.\n\nAt the end of the war, Marcus was fed by American soldiers and in return he gave them caps he made after teaching himself to be a tailor. He eventually immigrated to Milwaukee in 1950 where his cousins introduced Marcus to a young woman whose family had fled his same hometown before the war. Two months after they met, Marcus married Marlene and they were married 66 years until her death last month.\n\nHe worked as a tailor and clothing cutter in Milwaukee. After he retired, he began speaking at schools about his experiences.\n\n\"Once he retired, he stepped back and looked at his whole life and knew it was his obligation to make sure future generations knew what happened. He saw more death than any of us can imagine,\" said his son.\n\nIn addition to his son, Marcus is survived by daughter Sharon Lerman and grandchildren. Funeral services are scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday at the chapel of the Jewish Home and Care Center, 1414 N. Prospect Ave., Milwaukee.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.22680425643921, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 863, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 9, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.73332661425, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.20162224797219, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/20/iowans-vote-end-city/94173594/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [2554]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1063, "scraper_regex": 991}}, "headline": "Iowans vote to end city in desperate bid to save community ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 991, "date": "20161121020000", "story_content": "MOUNT UNION, Iowa \u2014 Many Americans considered the recent election to be an existential crisis, but that was certainly true for one tiny town in southeast Iowa.\n\nThis Henry County hamlet of barely more than 100 people was faced with the unenviable decision of whether to vote itself into oblivion: \"Shall the discontinuance of the City of Mount Union be approved?\"\n\nStop and think how that would feel: What if your home was at stake and you had to try to figure out which option \u2014 neither one ideal because of your city's meager finances and dim prospects for growth \u2014 would do the least harm?\n\nA speck set adrift in the middle of rich farmland, Mount Union is shaped like a backwards apostrophe or comma when you stare at it on a map.\n\nWhile the rest of the nation fixated on the presidential cliffhanger, Mount Union endured its own nail-biter vote that initially came in at 31-31.\n\n\"This was more important than the Trump election!\" said Linda Johnson, a resident and former city clerk whose petition triggered the referendum after the City Council already had voted to fold the city.\n\n\"I felt the citizens needed a voice in the discontinuance,\" she said.\n\nThe tie was the initial news brief. On election night, Henry County Auditor Shelly Barber saw what had happened in Mount Union and dove into her database. She found that one absentee ballot remained unaccounted for. As long as it met the postmark deadline, it still could break the tie.\n\n\"I was hoping so much that it came back,\" Barber said.\n\nIt did, postmarked Nov. 7, the day before the election. Johnson was so eager for the result that she was waiting at the courthouse later that week when the ballot was opened.\n\nThe news of Mount Union's demise by a whisker margin sparked another round of short articles.\n\nMy initial kooky thought was this: In a town this small, I would expect many of the residents know precisely who mailed that final ballot to forever seal the town's fate. Why not try to track down him or her?\n\n'People need to get along'\n\nIf all goes according to plan, Mount Union next year will become the 13th city in Iowa to evaporate since 1980 and the first since Center Junction in 2015.\n\nThe town was founded in 1904. Its population briefly topped 200 in the 1920s.\n\nThe school has long since shut down, with the brick behemoth now being renovated into apartments.\n\nThe Prairie Ag Co-op grain elevator dominates the skyline.\n\nA post office and bank downtown face each other across the street. The Union Station Caf\u00e9 on the north edge of town lacks any sort of sign out front since a car smashed the last one a few years ago.\n\nDiane Breon has operated her hair salon here for 30 years. She's a former city councilwoman, and her dad once served as mayor.\n\n\"I didn't want it to go this far,\" she said of her hometown's last gasp.\n\n\"People needed to get along,\" she added, \"swallow their pride.\"\n\nAs you might have guessed, many tangled threads of bitter disputes both personal and financial led to this giant knot. So the vote to scrap the town is the metaphorical pair of scissors in a last-ditch effort to cut the tension.\n\nThe city's sewer is the centerpiece of the saga.\n\nMount Union is one of many towns for which a state-mandated sewer upgrade is a heavy financial burden.\n\nThe city worked with Regional Utility Service Systems (RUSS), an entity created from southeast Iowa counties and funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help smaller communities bear the cost of such monumental overhauls.\n\nThe issue has played out in the last decade in city meetings, courtrooms and news stories.\n\nSuffice it to say that various factions have come to despise each other.\n\nSome blame either current or former city government for bad management. Some blame RUSS for installing a sewer system costlier to maintain. Some residents haven't paid their sewer bills out of protest. Faced with unpaid fees, RUSS has hiked the sewer bill until each property now pays $150 per month.\n\nBut RUSS has prevailed in court against the city, so Mount Union and its residents now owe the utility more than $30,000.\n\n\"By unincorporating we'll become a better community than a city,\" said John Marek, the current mayor. \"You take away the things that people have been fighting over, which is the power of the purse.\"\n\n\"If we don't do it we're going to tear each other's throats.\"\n\nJohnson and her brother, yet another former mayor, have sued Marek for defamation. That case is scheduled to enter court in February, one more small grenade tossed into the timeline of the city's death spiral.\n\nOnce Mount Union is absorbed into county jurisdiction, only a few streets may be plowed in winter. That worries some of the most vulnerable residents. And the streetlights will be shut off unless somebody wants to adopt one for $15 per month.\n\nOn the other hand, property taxes may drop by nearly 10%.\n\nMount Union's folk were fairly unanimous in at least one thing: They were surprised at the close vote.\n\nBut nobody would divulge the identity of that final absentee voter who broke the tie. A couple people claimed they knew who it was.\n\nA city land auction Wednesday begins the process of the city selling off its assets. The state's City Development Board could approve the discontinuance as soon as March.\n\nRobyn Buffington said she and her fellow townsfolk were told that as long as they follow proper procedure, such a request is unlikely to be denied.\n\n\"But who knows,\" she said, \"with our record we could be it. We could be the first.\"\n\nAnd then she indulged in a small, rueful laugh.\n\nBleak humor might be one of the few sure remedies left to residents here in the final months of Mount Union.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 24, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.1218638420105, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1063, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.666804406290001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161121020000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.19849482596425, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/01/11/charles-hudson-precursor-ventures-diversity/96446316/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Small venture firm, big mission: Diversity", "wordcount_as_scraped": 968, "date": "20170111200000", "story_content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Precursor Ventures is not yet a big name in venture capital, but it's taking on a big mission: Making sure more entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds get an equal shot at venture capital dollars and their Silicon Valley dreams.\n\nFor decades Silicon Valley has been known for its racial and gender gap. It's only in recent years that the technology industry has begun to try to close it. Nowhere is the lack of diversity more pronounced than in venture capital, a clubby profession dominated by white men who, by and large, fund very few start-ups founded by underrepresented minorities and women.\n\nA new wave of venture capital firms and a new generation of venture capitalists are emerging to shake up the status quo. Chief among them is Charles Hudson, one of the few African-American technology investors running his own venture firm.\n\nSince striking out on his own with Precursor Ventures two years ago, Hudson has raised $15.3 million for his first fund and made more than 50 investments with the help of an associate. Of those investments, 31% of the companies have at least one female founder, 16% have an African-American founder and 7% have a self-identified Hispanic or Latino founder, Hudson says.\n\nThose demographics are very different from the norm at traditional Silicon Valley venture firms.\n\nBy making investments at the formative stages of a company, well before later-stage investors open their wallets, Hudson hopes to gradually shift the gender and racial make-up of the tech industry, especially in its Silicon Valley power center.\n\n\"The fastest, simplest way to change the composition of the tech industry is to change who gets to make funding and hiring decisions,\" Hudson said in an interview with USA TODAY. \"I think we have ample evidence as to what the status quo produces and I don't expect significant change in outcomes until we have a more diverse set of leaders in positions of influence and authority.\"\n\nVenture capital is ground zero for the growing push to diversify the tech industry. Big bets by venture capitalists can give a young company the opportunity to mature from the larval stage into the next Facebook or Google. Yet a tiny fraction of start-ups led by women \u2014 and an even tinier fraction led by African Americans, Latinos and Native Americans \u2014 attract venture dollars.\n\nTo break that cycle, Hudson accepts a lot of cold calls and emails as he hunts for start-up founders with hustle, ingenuity and a good idea, not necessarily the \"central casting\" pedigree, such as studying at big name school or working for a hot start-up or major tech company. Many of Hudson's investments are outside of Silicon Valley and outside of tech hubs with venture capital firms.\n\nThis unconventional approach can make a big difference over time, uncovering promising entrepreneurs who don't fit the Silicon Valley start-up stereotype and who have been overlooked by traditional venture firms, Hudson says. His belief: It's also a competitive advantage.\n\nWhen Hudson met Samyr Qureshi, the founder of Knack was living in Florida. Qureshi had built a tutoring application for college students, but was not in a region with a strong tradition of venture-backed investing. \"I led the first institutional round of investment and the company is gearing up to relocate as they look to scale,\" Hudson says.\n\nAnother investment, mobile device repair start-up Fixt, hails from Baltimore. Hudson says he was drawn to its CEO Luke Cooper. \"From the first time I met Luke, I could tell that he and the team had spent a lot of time getting their model right and were on to something big,\" Hudson says.\n\nMatthew Capizzi, founder of ZenRez which lets you book last-minute yoga and fitness classes, had plenty of experience in biotechnology and healthcare, but not much in software. Capizzi, who started the company while in business school at Carnegie Mellon, now calls the Bay Area home.\n\nNot all of Precursor's investments back women or people of color, and that's by design.\n\n\"I certainly get a lot of questions from folks: Hey, is this going to be minority focused fund because you are black? And you know, I thought it was an interesting question. I tell people: No, it's not a minority focused fund. But I think we'll see a disproportionate share of people of color approach the fund because it looks approachable,\" Hudson says.\n\nWomen, African Americans and Latinos are significantly underrepresented in venture capital, with few holding decision-making positions, according to a report from the National Venture Capital Association and Deloitte University Leadership Center for Inclusion.\n\nWomen make up 45% of the venture capital workforce, mostly in administrative roles, but just 11% of investment partners, or the equivalent, on venture investment teams. African Americans make up 3% and Latinos 4% of the venture capital workforce. None of the 217 firms with more than 2,500 employees surveyed had an African-American investment partner.\n\nThere are signs of change, albeit slow in coming. Women are making the fastest strides. In October, Sequoia Capital, the prominent Silicon Valley venture firm that backed Apple and Google, hired its first female investing partner in the U.S. Before joining Sequoia, Jess Lee was co-founder and chief executive of Polyvore, the fashion and home decor shopping service bought in 2015 by Yahoo for $230 million.\n\nChampioning a more diverse set of entrepreneurs is a growing number of venture capitalists of color such as Base Ventures' Erik Moore, Cross Culture Ventures' Troy Carter, Marlon Nichols and Trevor Thomas, Laurence \"Lo\" Toney from GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), Y Combinator's Michael Seibel, Backstage Capital's Arlan Hamilton, Kapor Capital's Ellen Pao and Carolina Huaranca and 500 Startups' Monique Woodard.\n\n\"Venture capital is a business that changes very, very slowly,\" Hudson says. \"I am optimistic about the future, but I don't expect overnight progress on diversity.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.43706294894218495, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 963, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.38452309975, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170111200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.5576323987538898, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/11/17/norm-coleman-agent-trump-japan-saudi-arabia-super-pacs-money-mastio-column/88762936/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 873, "scraper_regex": 829}}, "headline": "Americans want leaders who are on our side: David Mastio", "wordcount_as_scraped": 829, "date": "20161118000000", "story_content": "Donald Trump's potential secretary of State pick Rudy Giuliani has taken a lot of guff for his foreign financial ties, leaving Trump looking a little silly for all his criticism of Hillary Clinton's extensive foreign conflicts of interest.\n\nNeverTrumpers like myself could have a good laugh at The Donald's expense, except for one thing: The problem of shady foreign ties afflicts all of Washington, left and right, Democrat and Republican, Trump-lovers and Trump-haters. Former Republican senator Norm Coleman is a case in point from among Trump's GOP political opponents.\n\nThis March, Coleman did something brave. Not only did he denounce Trump as a fraud and a bully, he accepted responsibility for the reality TV Republican's rise.\n\n\"Republican leaders are to blame,\" he wrote in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. \"Republicans like me \u2026 who could not believe or comprehend that anyone would take Trump seriously.

How could they be so important in a potential military confrontation between Japan and North Korea decades later and more than 1,000 miles away?\n\nIt turns out they are not important at all in East Asian geopolitics. Those children are important in a diplomatic confrontation even farther away \u2014 in a Washington struggle between Japan and South Korea to control how Americans remember the Japanese role in World War II.\n\nI did a little Googling and I found that the only folks other than Coleman who are talking about those kids is a group called Voices of Vietnam. I had never heard of them, but the English-language press in Japan reported that the group is actually a front for the Japanese government, which wants to paint South Korean bitterness about the rape of Korean women in World War II as hypocritical.\n\nAs I tried to track the story down, I found that Voices of Vietnam held a news conference at the National Press Club with Coleman to publicize the issue last year, but there is almost nothing on the Web about these unknown victims of that war except an English-language Wikipedia entry. When I took a close look, I noticed that about the time of Coleman's news conference, the Wikipedia page was edited a dozen times to match the arguments made by the non-profit group. Those edits were made through an Internet connection in a government building in Yokohama, Japan.\n\nNow, I was really curious. So I went to a Justice Department database of registered foreign agents and there I found that Mark Duffy, the PR guy who sent me Coleman's op-ed, just happens to be a registered agent of the Japanese government.\n\nBut surely, establishment stalwart Norm Coleman couldn't be writing about such a weighty issue as potential nuclear war at the behest of a foreign government, right? Well, Coleman and his law firm also just happen to be registered as representatives of the Japanese government as well as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nHis firm's contract even mentions helping Japan deal with leftover \"World War II issues\" such as the South Korean women whom Imperial Japan used as sex slaves.\n\nWhen I started asking questions about all these connections, Coleman sent his op-ed to the Capitol Hill newspaper, The Hill, which posted it online without asking too many questions. Coleman later told me by email that his \"efforts on behalf of Voices of Vietnam are in a personal capacity and have no ties to my work.\"\n\nMaybe that's true.\n\nWhen Coleman wrote this spring denouncing Trump, he wrote \"Americans are hungry for a strong leader.\" He was partially right. What they are hungry for is a strong leader who they are sure is on their side. That's why Trump is now the president-elect. Hopefully, Trump will remember that before he appoints Giuliani as secretary of State.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.37388730049133, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 873, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.1639936329500005, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 39, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161118000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.54545454545, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.467353951890031, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/07/maricopa-county-sheriff-joe-arpaio-election/93440700/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1510, "scraper_regex": 1343}}, "headline": "Joe Arpaio faces 'My Way' or highway in Tuesday election", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1343, "date": "20161107230000", "story_content": "WICKENBURG, Ariz. \u2014 Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio stood next to a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump at a Mexican restaurant on the outskirts of Phoenix, praising the Republican presidential candidate and railing against President Obama.\n\nThe Republican sheriff, a national anti-illegal-immigration icon, is facing his toughest race in a quarter century, trailing Democrat Paul Penzone in some polls.\n\nBut support for Arpaio was strong at the Believers for Trump meeting as the crowd of about 50 cheered Arpaio's claim that the Democratic administration is targeting him for doing his job.\n\nThe federal Justice Department plans to prosecute Arpaio on a charge of criminal contempt for defying orders from a GOP-appointed federal judge to stop immigration raids in a long-running case that found his office engaged in racial profiling.\n\nIf found guilty of contempt, Arpaio could face up to six months in jail though state law probably would not require him to resign because it's not clear if the charge is a misdemeanor or a felony. A decision is not expected before Tuesday.\n\nIf the charge worried the sheriff, he didn't show it that night at Lydia's La Canasta.\n\n\"If I do go to jail, I'm glad it'll be federal because I'll get three square meals a day,\" he said, joking.\n\nMore seriously, he questioned the timing of the charges.\n\n\"Of course, they did that the day before voting started,\" Arpaio told the crowd. \"They're hoping to destroy me so I can't get elected. ... I'm kind of a trophy to the White House.\"\n\nIndeed, Penzone's rematch with the sheriff has become a sort of litmus test for a party hoping to turn Arizona blue for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Critical to success in both races is activating a coalition of first-time voters, Latinos and disaffected Republicans.\n\nAn Arpaio victory depends on maintaining the conservative strongholds in suburbs that ring Phoenix that have kept him in office since 1993.\n\nPenzone lost by more than 80,000 votes to Arpaio four years ago with a third-party spoiler who isn't running this time. A confluence of other factors appears to have helped the 46-year-old retired Phoenix police sergeant gain ground.\n\nAt 84, Arpaio is older than Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Television ad spending this fall is closer to even after a political committee financed by liberal billionaire George Soros swooped in to support Penzone.\n\nAnd the contempt case against Arpaio represents the culmination of years of wearying lawsuits that have dogged the sheriff and eroded public support.\n\nArpaio's office now is under court monitoring, and he is appealing a finding of civil contempt, saying his violations weren't intentional.\n\nThe man who has been branded as \"America's Toughest Sheriff\" brags about his old-school habits.\n\nHe touts his 50 years of law-enforcement experience, including his international work as a federal drug-enforcement agent.\n\n\"Despite all the criticism, I've always been tough on criminals,\" the sheriff said in one ad. \"I've never backed down from a fight, and I never will.\"\n\nOther ads emphasize his work against animal abuse and success rehabilitating inmates through a drug program.\n\nArpaio also has revamped an old attack on his opponent, calling him dangerous based on protective orders Penzone and his ex-wife filed against each other in a domestic dispute years ago.\n\nA judge eventually dismissed the orders. Penzone's ex-wife, while not denying the incident, released an affidavit this year that Penzone was not a violent husband.\n\nPenzone has sued Arpaio for defamation.\n\nThough most polls have shown Arpaio trailing or tied with Penzone, the sheriff's campaign has advantages. The county leans heavily Republican and the party's voters more reliably show up at the polls.\n\nAnd Arpaio raises money prolifically, particularly from donors outside Arizona. He collected nearly $13 million compared with Penzone's roughly $1 million.\n\nSoros has attempted to balance the scales by pouring at least $3.2 million into the race with about $1.5 million of it nearly matching the sheriff's spending on TV ads, according to finance reports and calculations by Paul Weich, co-founder of the website Arizona's Politics.\n\nStill Arpaio's popularity is long standing. At the restaurant meeting, Vern Correa, 59, a Republican retired from the Army, recalled learning of Arpaio years ago when Correa lived in Hawaii.\n\n\"I finally met a legend,\" said Correa, sporting a cowboy hat. \"This man here has been fighting for justice for three quarters of his life. I am so sick and tired of people not abiding by the laws. \u2026 We need stiff punishment.\"\n\nPenzone promises to remove politics from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office and focus on policing. He argues that Arpaio's fame-hunting has hurt victims and cost taxpayers:\n\n\"It is long overdue that we take this office back and it becomes something we're proud of,\" Penzone said. \"I have always been strong on crime. I have always pursued criminals to the end of the planet. Every victim's voice matters to me.\"\n\nPenzone said he would consider closing the notorious Tent City. When faced with the need to cut costs to afford legal fees, Arpaio recently slashed employee raises rather than close the facility despite it being nearly empty and other jails having open beds.\n\n\"Do you want a real law-enforcement leader in your community or do you want to continue the propaganda?\" Penzone asked.\n\nEven some high-ranking Republicans are rooting publicly for the sheriff to go.\n\n\"How can any conservative support or vote for a person who is costing taxpayers this much money?\" Phoenix Councilman Sal DiCiccio told the Ahwatukee Foothills News. \"Nobody in my family is voting for Joe, and that's really, really hard because I like him personally and I like many of his policies.\"\n\nIn a race that could swing on a small number of votes, the sheriff's critics are hoping that newly registered and infrequent voters will cast early ballots this year.\n\nOn a sweltering October day, hundreds of anti-Arpaio activists were gathered to knock on thousands of doors across Phoenix. Some had driven in from as far as New Orleans, Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\nThey were organized by a new group, called Bazta Arpaio, or \"No more Arpaio\" in Spanish, in what was billed as the largest-ever canvass against the sheriff.\n\nA majority were Latinos in their teens and 20s, who shared tales of fear at the hands of his deputies:\n\n\"Arpaio sets the tone for hate not just for Phoenix \u2014 for the whole country!\" an organizer shouted.\n\nIn a low-income neighborhood with manicured lawns in south Phoenix, canvassers Daphne Cervantes, 17, and Maximiliano Gutierrez, 15, struck out at most apartments. Voters weren't home or didn't want to vote. But a few responded.\n\nHeather Cadena, 26, had thrown away her mail-in ballot. Cervantes told her how to request a new one.\n\n\"I wasn't even thinking about it,\" said Cadena, whose boyfriend said he had endured the sheriff's jails. She promised to take action. \"I don't like him (Arpaio). He degrades people.\"\n\nHector Roman Palomares, 22, had just awakened after a shift at a fast-food restaurant. Red and pink roses bloomed outside his home.\n\nHis ballot was empty so far, but he pulled it out to fill in the arrow for Penzone after the canvassers asked him to.\n\n\"I'm in \u2014 the moment you said that,\" Palomares said.\n\nHe acknowledged Arpaio helps the community sometimes, especially protecting animals.\n\n\"But the one humongous reason I don't like him and will never vote for him ... is he'll discriminate against anybody that looks illegal,\" Palomares said. \"Even the court told him to stop doing the raids. He doesn't learn the lesson.\"\n\nBack at the Trump meeting in Wickenburg, about 50 miles northwest of Phoenix but still in Maricopa County, Arpaio's supporters hoped the sheriff would see a different outcome \u2014 at the ballot box and in the courtroom.\n\nRestaurant owner Lydia Abril led the group in prayer.\n\n\"Here is a man who has stood for truth and for righteousness. Has he made mistakes? We've all made mistakes,\" Abril said. \"We ask in the name of Jesus, you would raise a hedge of protection around Sheriff Joe and that you would bring favor in the courts.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 26, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.6599764823913596, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1510, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 7.14894663685, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 26, "mft_sum": 58, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161107230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 5.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 3.84105960264901, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/27/anti-abortion-rally-mike-pence-beacon-hope/97151584/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "At anti-abortion rally, Mike Pence is a beacon of hope", "wordcount_as_scraped": 590, "date": "20170127230000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Pence marked a big moment Friday in his decades-long fight against abortion, simply by walking on stage.\n\nA week after taking the oath of office, Pence became the highest ranking official to appear in person at the annual March for Life demonstration. The significance of his presence wasn't lost on the cheering crowd.\n\n\"Vice President Pence's appearance here is huge,\" said David Etters, a high school theology teacher from Jackson, Mich. \"It's an endorsement for this agenda for life.\"\n\nDebra Maddrell, a retired naval officer from Vienna, Va., said \"It says that he walks the walk as well as talks the talk.\"\n\nIn introducing her husband, Pence's wife Karen reminded the audience, \"This is not our first March for Life.\"\n\nIn prior years, Republican presidents have addressed the March for Life by phone or video, but Trump sent Pence instead.\n\n\"He asked me to thank you for your support, for your stand for life and for your compassion for the women and children of America,\" Pence said.\n\nSome of those gathered here expressed uncertainty about Trump's personal beliefs. Nearly 20 years ago, he described himself as \"very pro-choice,\" but he has since said he has evolved.\n\nBut the attendees said they see Pence, an evangelical Christian, as a steadfast ally who can hold Trump accountable on an anti-abortion agenda.\n\nIn Congress, Pence was a leader in efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and co-sponsored \"personhood\" legislation calling for Constitutional rights at the moment of fertilization. As governor of Indiana, he signed several anti-abortion bills, including one that banned abortions solely because of genetic abnormalities \u2013 legislation that was suspended by a federal judge.\n\n\"We still need as voters to hold Trump's feet to the fire, but I feel like we've got an ally there (in Pence) and that feels like a first in my lifetime,\" said Anna Thomas, a kindergarten teacher from Tuckahoe, N.Y.\n\nDuring his speech, Pence highlighted Trump's move this week to reinstate a policy to prevent foreign aid from funding organizations that promote or perform abortions. He said the administration will work with Congress to permanently bar taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion providers. And he added that Trump next week will announce a Supreme Court nominee who will \"uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.\"\n\n\"Life is winning in America,\" he said to cheers. \"And today is a celebration of the progress that we have made in the cause.\"\n\nDemocrats, in a fundraising email, cited Pence's statement as \"another one of this administration's trademark 'alternative facts.'\" The email added that the administration's policies \"will lead to more abortions and more women dying from being denied life-saving care.\"\n\nBut at the march, his remarks were seen as \"everything we're standing for,\" said Sheri Tharp, 48, a nurse practitioner from Howard, Ohio.\n\nTharp said Pence has \"been about life the whole time,\" and she's relying on him to \"bend the president's ear toward our direction.\" She wants to \"eliminate\" abortion from the law.\n\n\"I do think (Trump's) there,\" she said. \"I just think he needs the guidance to prudently get the laws passed. He's pro-life but I'm not sure he's been actively involved as Mike Pence has.\"\n\nOf Trump, Anna Thomas said, \"I don't believe that he is personally pro-life at all.

Donald B. Kimple's extensive letters home from Europe sat in an Ohio basement for nearly a half-century, concealed from the outside world since World War II.\n\nKimple died of brain cancer in December 2000 at age 82 in Lakewood, Ohio. His sons later discovered that their father's meticulous wartime correspondence offered a personalized view of some of the war's landmark events, including the D-Day invasion of Normandy, the liberation of Paris and V-E Day in Europe.\n\nTheir father had a unique perspective: Kimple served as personal secretary to the assistant adjutant general with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in London, Paris and Frankfurt, Germany. SHAEF was commanded by Gen. Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nSome of Kimple's letters were written on SHAEF letterhead. Others were marked confidential \u2014 and one was written in code. The majority remained in their original envelopes, with vintage postage stamps affixed.\n\nKimple's son Bob, who lives in Melbourne, feared these irreplaceable historic artifacts would get lost or discarded \u2014 as has occurred in countless military families across America over the decades. So for the past six months, he has worked with curators and archivists at the National World War II Museum to donate his father's documents.\n\nNow, the \u200bwartime journal of Sgt. Donald B. Kimple is permanently archived at the museum in New Orleans. The comprehensive collection includes about 120 handwritten and typewritten letters, telegrams and V-mails, which were letters printed on microfilm and exchanged between U.S. troops abroad and their families. The journal also includes about 60 postcards, more than 40 photographs and other military memorabilia.\n\n\"Every one of these collections is priceless, in the sense that it's totally unique. Each one is individual, especially like the collection Mr. Kimple gave us. The letters and the postcards and the photographs and the personal records all tell a complete story of this person's service,\" said Lisa Werling, processing archivist at the museum.\n\n\"This person kept such a complete narrative of his service. The other thing I really liked about his collection is, he had booklets describing Camp Barkeley in Texas where he got trained. People didn't keep that kind of thing. They just tossed it or didn't keep it with them when they went overseas. To have that little glimpse into that time period is so special,\" Werling said.\n\nEach item will be cataloged for use by World War II researchers, museum staffers, educational programs and the general public. Werling said Kimple's collection will be stored in a climate-controlled vault \u2014 \"this is going to be preserved for generations.\"\n\nBob Kimple worked on the family archive project with two older brothers: Donald M. Kimple, a retired U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant commander, and John Kimple, who served as a Navy anti-submarine warfare technician aboard the USS Wasp.\n\nThe National World War II Museum is in the midst of a multiyear $370 million expansion. Werling said the facility is tripling its vault space to accommodate new collections and archives, and she is working on an ongoing $10 million digitization project to post oral histories and photographs online for public access.\n\nBob Kimple, 67, was a Navy photographer who served during the Vietnam War aboard the final tour of the USS Catskill, a mine countermeasures support ship. He keeps the U.S. flag that was placed atop his father's casket inside his Melbourne condominium.\n\n\"The powers that be saw something in him. He was an extraordinary typist. He had shorthand, stenography, terrific English, great vocabulary. And he just rose right up through the ranks,\" Bob Kimple said of his late father.\n\n\"His principal job was typing out the travel orders, and a lot of these movements of troops and personnel and higher-ups were confidential. Nobody moved anywhere without having orders in their hands,\" he said.\n\nDonald B. Kimple could type 70 words per minute and take shorthand at 100 words per minute, according to his separation qualification record.\u200b His letters chronologically began with his Army recruitment in New Cumberland, Pa., (Aug. 23, 1943) and ended with his final letter, \"Going Home,\" from Paris (Dec. 13, 1945).\n\nMindful of military censors, he sometimes referred to his location in vague terms such as \"somewhere in England\" or \"somewhere in Germany.\"\n\n\"I started piecing through this memorabilia and started opening up each of these envelopes, and reading his accounts. Once I discovered who he worked for and what he did, I said, 'Oh my God. This is of historical importance,'\" Bob Kimple said.\n\n\"It really is spectacular to have learned about what he did. And I am so proud.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.332594245672226, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 790, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.07370118226, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161111040000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.67088607594937, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2016/11/27/travel-fixes-improvements-complaints/94339472/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 864, "scraper_regex": 674}}, "headline": "5 things that need to be fixed in travel now", "wordcount_as_scraped": 674, "date": "20161128140000", "story_content": "No one likes to be wrong, especially when you write the best darned travel column in American journalism. So when a flight attendant flagged an inaccuracy in one of my recent stories, my heart skipped a beat.\n\n\"I just wanted to tell you it's against the law to photograph a working flight attendant and also against the law to video any working crew member at any time,\" she wrote. \"Thank you for correcting this information.\"\n\nUh-oh. For years, I've advised travelers to take pictures and videos when something goes wrong, including on a plane. Was I incorrect?\n\nI'll have the answer in a second. But fixing errors \u2014 that's actually a worthy topic. The holiday travel season is near, and while a lot of folks are on the road, I know I'm not the only one asking: How do you fix what's wrong about travel?\n\nMake no mistake, the industry is broken. Badly. More than 17% of respondents to a new Aspect Software survey said they'd stopped doing business with a travel company in 2016 because of poor customer service, a 45% increase from last year. It's a trend that Joe Gagnon, Aspect's chief customer strategy officer, calls \"alarming.\" If it continues, the industry will soon overtake the telecom and cable industry as a leader in bad customer service.\n\nBut the damage can be repaired. Here's how:\n\nThere seems to be no escape from the fees and surcharges. Though some are technically avoidable, most are not. Travel companies used to apologize for them, but recently, as the profits began to pour in, they've gone silent. \"Stop with the nickel-and-dime fees already,\" says Louis Altman, a frequent traveler who runs a telecommunication company in Portsmouth, N.H. \"Why do I need to pay to pick a seat? Why do I need to pay to bring my stuff with me? I know fees are a massive profit center, but ugh \u2014 stop it!\"\n\nIf you think the division of the classes is un-American, try flying. The cabin is clearly and unapologetically divided between haves and have-nots. \"I'd like to eliminate the class system the airlines use based on status,\" says Angela Berardino, a frequent flier who works for a communication agency in Denver. \"The drama and stress it causes to secure a seat, to line up to board \u2014 it honestly makes travel much, much more stressful. And I'm someone who has status on multiple legacy carriers.\"\n\nIf you travel, it's hard to escape the web of lies spun around each product and service. \"Review sites are easily bamboozled,\" says Tom Sheehan, who runs a tour company based in Gainesville, Fla. \"Competitors can sign up under multiple pseudonyms and write scathing reviews about their competition. Dissatisfied customers embellish the issues to seek revenge on the property they feel let them down.\" Simply put, many user-generated review sites are compromised.\n\nIt seems so simple: Quote a rate, and that's what you charge. No \"resort\" fee, no extras, no surprises. Howard Zoufaly, a business consultant from Broomfield, Colo., says hotels don't always honor their commitments. One property, which offered \"free\" breakfast, recently made him pay. The reason? He stayed on a weekend. \"It was false advertising,\" he says. \"Consumers can't depend on the travel industry to keep their word.\"\n\nIf you've flown in an economy class airline seat lately, then you know exactly what I mean. It's cramped, and often the service is degrading. Kevin Farris, an account manager for a pharmaceutical company in Philadelphia, wonders why airlines can't offer a humane amount of personal space. \"I just want to sit comfortably,\" he says. In an industry built on hospitality, no one should ever be treated like that.\n\nWouldn't it be great if one newspaper column could end customer-unfriendly fees and make the industry fairer, more honest \u2014 even more humane?

Republicans hold a 52-seat majority in the Senate, and they need only 50 senators to support a nominee since Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be able to cast a vote to break any tie.\n\nHistory is also on Trump's side. Only nine Cabinet nominees have been rejected by the Senate since 1834, according to the Senate Historical Office.\n\nHowever, the often-grueling hearings have led some nominees to withdraw from the process altogether. Since 1801, a dozen nominees have either withdrawn or were never voted on by the committees considering them, Senate historians said.\n\nHere's a look at this week's rundown of confirmation hearings:\n\nTuesday\n\n\u2022 Attorney general. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., will be interrogated by his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, where he has been serving as chairman of the immigration subcommittee. Look for Democrats to go after him hard on voting rights, gay rights and immigration enforcement and to bring up the fact that Sessions was rejected for a federal judgeship in 1986 over allegations of racism. Republicans will counter that criticism by portraying Sessions, a former federal prosecutor, as a man of integrity who has spent his career protecting the public from criminals and weeding out government corruption.\n\n\u2022 Homeland Security secretary. Retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, the former commander of U.S. Southern Command, faces questions from the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Expect senators to question him about his warnings that terrorists could link up with Latin American drug smugglers to threaten the United States by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. He also is sure to be asked about Trump's controversial plan to build a border wall.\n\nWednesday\n\n\u2022 Secretary of state. Former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson could face opposition from some Republicans as he seeks to become the next secretary of State. GOP Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida have all joined Democrats in expressing concern about Tillerson's close business ties to Russia. Rubio sits on the Foreign Relations Committee and is expected to pose some of the most pointed questions to Tillerson about his dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u2022 Transportation secretary. This hearing before the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee should be one of the least contentious \u2014 and not just because nominee Elaine Chao is the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Chao is well-known and respected by members of both parties on Capitol Hill. She served as secretary of Labor for President George W. Bush and as deputy secretary of Transportation for President George H.W. Bush.\n\nThursday\n\n\u2022 Defense secretary. Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis has been praised by Armed Services Chairman John McCain for his \"clear understanding of the many challenges facing the Department of Defense, the U.S. military, and our national security.\" However, some Democrats on the panel oppose granting Mattis a waiver of the requirement that nominees leave active duty at least seven years before seeking the job. Mattis left the military four years ago. The requirement was designed to preserve civilian control of the military.\n\n\u2022 Housing and urban development secretary. Nominee Ben Carson \u2014 the former Republican presidential candidate and retired brain surgeon \u2014 is nothing if not unpredictable, which could bring some excitement to what is otherwise expected to be a relatively low-key hearing. Before he was nominated by Trump, Carson put out the word through longtime adviser Armstrong Williams that he had taken himself out of the running for a Cabinet position because he had no government experience and lacked the background necessary to run a federal agency. Expect Democrats to use Carson's own words to question his qualifications.\n\n\u2022 Commerce secretary. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross has not generally drawn the same kind of fire from Democrats that many of Trump's other nominees have, in part because Democrats agree with his calls to create jobs by investing in public works projects and his opposition to controversial trade pacts also opposed by unions. But Commerce Committee Democrats are still expected to press Ross on his business dealings, including a 2006 explosion that killed 12 miners at a West Virginia mine owned by Ross' company.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.69430041313171, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 835, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.52589890717, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170109220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5928143712574796, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://experience.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/15/dakota-pipeline-protest-across-us/93937858/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Opponents of Dakota oil pipeline protest across USA", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1148, "date": "20161116040000", "story_content": "Opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline protested in Canada and cities around the USA on Tuesday, from San Francisco to Washington, D.C.\n\nTuesday was recognized as a \"Day of Action\" by opponents of the 1,172-mile, 30-inch diameter underground pipeline planned to deliver crude oil from production areas in North Dakota to Patoka, Ill. The pipeline would cross through land considered sacred by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and environmentalists worry about how the pipeline might affect water quality.\n\nFormer Democratic presidential candidate and independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders joined demonstrators outside the White House on Tuesday evening.

Kennedy Jr. visited the main protest camp near the Missouri River in southern North Dakota, saying it's important to \"the future of humanity.\"\n\nThe pipeline route goes under the river, which is the source of the tribe's drinking water.\n\nKennedy says the $3.8 billion pipeline will benefit billionaires, not the American people.\n\nPipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners says the pipeline is safe and noted that delays have already cost the project more than $100 million.\n\nIn a motion filed Monday night, pipeline developer Dakota Access asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to authorize the sole remaining and most hotly contested portion of the pipeline: the underground crossing of Lake Oahe.\n\nIn its court filing, Dakota Access warned that further delay \"would add millions of dollars more each month in costs which cannot be recovered.\"\n\nIn New Orleans, those demonstrating against the Dakota pipeline were joined by people protesting the 60-mile-long Bayou Bridge, also an Energy Transfer Partners project.\n\n#NoDAPL solidarity with #NoBayouBridge starting up in #NOLA now pic.twitter.com/o8RHjXU2Oa\u2014 Stanford Rosenthal (@stan) November 15, 2016\n\nAt Campus Martius Park in downtown Detroit, about 200 demonstrators carried signs, sounded horns and chanted \"Water is life.\" Native Americans, dressed in traditional garb and beating drums, also participated.

The biggest fires were in Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nA charter jet carrying the five, 20-person handcrews, most from Washington and Oregon, touched down at TAC Air of McGhee Tyson Airport around 4 p.m. ET. The crews were not the first, nor will they be the last, recruited to alleviate the drought and wildfire emergency plaguing the Southeast. Thirty-five crews had already landed, and five to seven crews were slated to arrive each day this week in Knoxville \u2014 a prime hub because of its central location, said Eastern Area Incident Management Team spokeswoman Catherine Coele.\n\nWhen the jet hits the tarmac, the firefighters on board have no idea where they will be heading or what fire they will be fighting, whether it's in Tennessee, Georgia or North Carolina, Coele said. They are given that information later at the \"mobilization center\" \u2014 a conference room at the nearby Hilton Hotel.\n\n\"When they hit the ground, our guys let the Coordination Center know, and they get their resource orders, which have the incidents they'll be assigned to,\" Coele said as firefighters formed a makeshift assembly line and threw large red luggage bags from person to person.\n\nThe crews received their assignments Tuesday night and were tentatively scheduled to depart Knoxville in rental trucks early Wednesday morning, though \"it's a very fluid process,\" Coele said.\n\nCoele, who works as a fire prevention specialist on most days, said in her 10-year career, she's never seen a wildfire emergency of this magnitude in the South.\n\nA thick, hazy layer of smoke lingered Tuesday across western North Carolina with many roads, trails and state parks remaining closed as thousands of firefighters continued a fierce battle against roughly 16 wildfires.\n\nPeople could also be heard coughing, seen rubbing their eyes or heard blowing their noses as Asheville and surrounding western towns have been experiencing poor air quality, according to Buncombe County Health and Human Services officials.\n\n\"With the current air quality level in the 'unhealthy' range in the Asheville area, even healthy people may experience symptoms,\" said Dr. Jennifer Mullendoor, Health and Human Services medical director. \"Everyone should limit their time spent outdoors. Wildfire smoke can be particularly dangerous for children, older adults, and those with heart or lung disease. Individuals in these sensitive groups should avoid all outdoor physical activity at this time.\"\n\nAcross the region, firefighters have made progress as containment percentages have increased among several fires, but with windy conditions, warmer temperatures, low humidity levels and no rain in the forecast crews will have to remain vigilant to keep flames from spreading.\n\nIn all, just under 46,000 acres were burning Tuesday, according to the InciWeb Incident Information System, which compiles information from state and federal forest agencies. Flames spread about 2,000 acres in total for 15 active wildfires since Monday.\n\nAccording to Gov. Pat McCory, 1,600 firefighters have battled 19 wildfires in western North Carolina with the cost of resources exceeding more than $10 million since Oct. 23, with 1,780 structures threatened and one structure sustaining damage. Two structures have been destroyed.\n\nArson is suspected in a majority of the Nantahala National Forest fires, according to the U.S. Forest Service and incident command teams. A lightning strike started one fire and some were thought to be human-caused, such as campfires left unattended or cigarettes tossed without being completed extinguished. The Party Rock fire near Lake Lure remains under investigation.\n\nRandall Blakley, a 10-year veteran firefighter from Washington who landed in Knoxville Tuesday, said he has fought blazes in the South a handful of times.\n\n\"It seems like to me, every year the drought gets worse,\" Blakley said. \"It's something we have to prepare for every year.\"\n\nFighting fires in the South will be different from fighting fires in the North or out west because of the different materials that fuel the flames, Blakley said.\n\n\"Up north we're looking at a lot of big trees, a lot of fires and digging a lot of lines (strips of land cleared of flammable materials and dug down to mineral soil) with a lot of tools. Over here we're looking at a lot of leaf litter and a lot of raking, maybe even using leaf blowers over here, which we don't use at all in region six.\"\n\n\"When the fire's coming towards us, we'll get a good ridge top where we're going to put the line in, and we'll put two leaf blowers up in front. The leaf blowers will blow the leaves out of the way, and we'll get the saw teams in and cut the limbs out of the way. Then we'll dig in behind to get the minimal fuel underneath the leaves. But the leaves are what's carrying a lot of the fire.\"\n\nThe danger firefighters face begins when they get into their vehicles to head to their assignments, said Kim Lemke, a Wisconsin resident who has worked as a safety officer for the Great Lakes Agency for 38 years. Lemke, who briefed the firefighters on safety, told crew leaders that Knoxville natives call Alcoa Highway \"I'll Kill Ya Highway\" due to the crazy traffic.\n\n\"The biggest exposure they're going to have from this point on to whatever fire they're assigned to is their driving,\" Lemke said. \"A lot of the firefighters come from rural areas. They're not used to the city traffic, so we want to brief them and make sure they're driving defensively, that everybody's communicating back and forth with their vehicles on radio, that they have a navigator and that the driver's not distracted.\"\n\nEven though flames were holding steady Tuesday officials said they expected to see rapid fire growth in North Carolina later in the week.\n\nSlightly stronger winds, especially on ridge tops, could affect fire behavior as the smoke clears and the sun warms and dries south-facing slopes. The Boteler fire and Nantahala Branch fires incident meteorologist expected clear skies by midmorning, which would benefit aerial operations.\n\nHowever, a strong cold front Saturday will bring little to no moisture to the fire.\n\nGusty winds from the southwest will start Thursday and could push the Party Rock fire to the north and northeast toward Weed Patch Mountain and the Gray Rock community. Windy conditions could also move flames toward the evacuated communities of Rumbling Bald Resort. With temperatures expected to warm into the low 70s and relative humidity levels dropping below 30%, rapid fire growth was anticipated.\n\n\"As the lower humidity continues to dry out the fuels and the wind increases the rate of fire will spread,\" Mazzeo said.\n\nMany evacuations were ordered last week as flames threatened several structures, but some residents were able to return to their homes Tuesday if they had been evacuated in the neighborhoods of Boys Camp Road near the Party Rock fire, according to a news release from the Henderson County sheriff's office.\n\nAdditionally, evacuations were lifted for residents in Swain and Macon County.\n\nA total fire ban remained in effect in the Nantahala and Pisgah National Forests until further notice. A Forest Service ban on all open burning in Clay, Jackson, Macon, and Swain counties was also in effect.\n\nOfficials were urging people to be as careful as they can with fire.\n\n\"Another fire can easily start and we don't want someone to pay for one of these,\" Bearer said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 20, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.34968900680542, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1277, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.621681757719999, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161116070000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.74079874706343, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/11/16/you-can-see-purge-rohingyas-myanmar-space/93950472/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 754, "scraper_regex": 683}}, "headline": "You can see the purge of Myanmar's Rohingyas from space", "wordcount_as_scraped": 683, "date": "20161116130000", "story_content": "If Myanmar's notorious army is to be believed \u2014 that's a very big if \u2014 its soldiers are facing a highly deranged adversary.\n\nAlong Myanmar's marshy coastline, villages keep going up in flames. All of them belong to the Rohingya, a horribly persecuted Muslim group. The arsonists? Muslims themselves, according to the army.\n\nThe Rohingya, we are told, are burning their own homes to attract well-armed government platoons \u2014 and then sprinting at them with knives, berserker style, so that they can get mowed down by the dozens.\n\nThis narrative defies logic. But it's hard to challenge directly \u2014 and that's how the army likes it.\n\nMyanmar's military has turned much of the Rohingya's homeland into a no-go zone for aid workers and non-compliant journalists. It has become, in the words of one expert, an \"information black hole.\"\n\nRelieved of prying eyes, the military is aggressively purging Muslim villages that have been infiltrated by an \"extremist violent ideology.\"\n\nThese raids began shortly after the October emergence of a poorly armed Rohingya militant group numbering in the hundreds. According to government reports, a series of clashes have killed about 17 officers and more than 65 militants.\n\nThe military is now in a highly advantageous position. It brings superior firepower \u2014 columns of troops and attack choppers \u2014 to combat a ragtag group that is mostly armed with \"small guns, swords, spears and sticks.\"\n\nFurthermore, Myanmar's predominately Buddhist citizens appear to broadly support the army's purges. In one of Asia's most ethnically diverse nations, no group is as denigrated as the Rohingya.\n\nEven fresh claims of soldiers gang-raping Rohingya women at gunpoint have stirred little domestic outcry. One official, speaking to the BBC, has refuted the claims by insisting Rohingya women are too \"dirty\" to arouse troops.\n\nThe army is operating in a void, free of critical onlookers who might defy the official narrative. However, technology offers a few ways to illuminate the facts.\n\nUsing satellite images, Human Rights Watch has monitored the remote region where the army's purge is ongoing. Their findings: a widespread torching of villages that has incinerated at least 400 buildings.\n\n\"These satellite images of village destruction could be the tip of the iceberg given the grave abuses being reported,\" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director with Human Rights Watch.\n\nIn addition to cameras orbiting the Earth, mobile phone cameras are also helping to reveal Rohingya suffering. Shaky footage, allegedly capturing the aftermath of air strikes, appears to show the corpses of children sprawled out on the grass.\n\nThe exact nature of these videos is hard to verify. But they suggest the Rohingya death toll is not limited to wild-eyed terrorists rushing suicidally at soldiers.\n\nThe plight of the Rohingya, already among the world's most tormented groups, appears to grow increasingly dire.\n\nAbout 10% of the population of approximately 1 million already lives in bleak internment camps controlled by the army. Food and medicine is scarce. Travel outside is restricted. Hunger is rampant.\n\nAs for the nation's much-celebrated pro-democracy crowd that swirls around Myanmar's iconic, de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi?

Rather than indulging backbiting postmortems on what went wrong, they must turn the corner immediately to find a new sense of purpose and unity. Here are three places to start:\n\nStop demonizing the opposition. Over the weary course of a relentlessly depressing campaign, American voters have heard far more about conservative outrage toward President Obama and Hillary Clinton than they've learned about GOP visions for positive reform. Just as the current president took office, the nation's most influential conservative commentator expressed his desire to see the new chief executive fail. Some Republicans sought to disqualify Obama as an illegitimate usurper through the birther canard, or tried to portray him as a kamikaze commander in chief with a demented determination to damage or destroy the nation he had been elected to serve. The same tone persisted against Clinton, with ugly chants of \"Lock her up!\" appealing solely to right-wing true believers. With their apocalyptic depictions of diabolical Democrats, too many Republicans failed the most obvious challenge confronting them: persuading millions who voted for Obama twice to switch to the support of a Republican nominee. Most of the public craves more collaboration and pragmatic progress in Washington. Regardless of which party controls the levers of power, you can't achieve that sort of cooperation if you're promising to throw your opponents into jail, or warning that their evil intentions threaten the very existence of our republic.\n\nDon't make absurd promises that can't be kept. In the final stages of his campaign, Trump has downplayed his far-fetched pledge to build a big, beautiful impenetrable border wall while handing Mexico the bill. No sober analyst could possibly believe that even a president with magical, mystical deal-making prowess could ever deliver on such a vow. Other GOP promises to obliterate Obamacare or to shut down the government count as comparably preposterous: with 20 million Americans newly insured under the Affordable Care Act, it would be far more realistic to pledge repair rather than repeal, and to concentrate on fixing the most obnoxious elements of this bureaucratic nightmare. Similarly, Republicans should stop sloganeering about \"closing the border\" and deporting untold millions, instead promoting meaningful reform to enhance border security, crack down on visa overstayers, and make it nearly impossible to work except for those undocumented who go through an arduous process to earn legal status.\n\nPush radical reform of the nomination process. Republicans must scrap the endless, incomprehensible system of nominee selection that shattered their party and produced the least popular nominee in history. Most obvious, it makes no sense for Iowa and New Hampshire, two small, deeply unrepresentative states, to continue their outsize role in winnowing the field. Primaries should be concentrated in a brief period \u2014 no more than six weeks \u2014 with multiple primaries on each of four pre-selected days of early spring. In this way, no state would assume irrational, disproportionate importance. The two front-runners at the conclusion of the state primaries would proceed to a national primary in September, with the winner selected as presidential nominee and the defeated candidate as the running mate. This would ensure that a majority of party voters actually backed the ultimate nominee, while the two leaders tempered any animus toward each other due to the certainty that they'd appear together on the fall ticket. If the party still wanted to celebrate that ticket with a festive, costly national party convention, it might still do so \u2014 but without the silly pretense that these events constituted anything more than a TV-ready pep rally.\n\nThese reformist resolutions will help Republicans rebuild from the image-wrecking excesses of 2016, regardless of which party captures the White House.\n\nIf Trump becomes president, such priorities will generate more broad-based support than any agenda of tearing up trade deals, jailing opponents or shattering overseas alliances.\n\nAnd if Clinton assumes power, a fresh approach that transcends the disasters and distortions of the recent past could empower a new generation of GOP leaders to rebuild credibility as a loyal opposition that can work with and not against the interests of the new administration in bringing new confidence to a deeply dispirited nation.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

Those countries are known as the Northern Triangle, where extreme gang violence has prompted many to flee, experts say.\n\nThe families are usually women with children. There also are still many minors traveling without parents. After entering the U.S. illegally, they typically turn themselves into Border Patrol agents in hopes of applying for asylum in the U.S.\n\nThe rise in Central American migrants arriving at the U.S. border contributed to an overall increase in apprehensions by the Border Patrol in fiscal year 2016 to 408,870 from 331,333, a 23% increase. Overall apprehensions, however, remain at levels not seen since the mid-1970s, according to Border Patrol statistics.\n\nThe number of Central American families and minors dropped in fiscal year 2015. But there has been another big wave in 2016 on par with the one in 2014.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Patrol officials announced Thursday that a temporary detention facility is being built in Tornillo, southeast of El Paso, Texas, to help process the influx of Central American families and unaccompanied minors.\n\nThe facility will open next week with room for up to 500 migrants. It's another indication of how Central American migrants arriving at the border are spreading to different locations.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said earlier this month that there are about 41,000 people being held in immigration detention centers, about 10,000 more than usual, as a result of the recent rise in migrants along the southern border.\n\nAs a result, immigration-enforcement officials have begun freeing some Haitian migrants arriving in Arizona and California in response to the surge in border crossings.\n\nBetween Sept. 20 and Nov. 16, Immigration and Customs Enforcement released approximately 900 Haitian nationals because of the lack of detention space, according to ICE officials. Before their release, they were given paperwork instructing them to appear before an immigration judge. As of Nov. 12, 4,425 Haitian nationals remained in ICE custody.\n\nYasmeen Pitts-O'Keefe, an ICE spokeswoman in Phoenix, declined to say where the Haitian nationals were released.\n\nShe issued a written statement that said custody determinations are made on a case-by-case basis, \"prioritizing serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety.\"\n\nThe El Paso sector has seen the largest increase in family-member apprehensions, up 364% in fiscal year 2016, according to Border Patrol statistics. Apprehensions of unaccompanied minors in the El Paso sector rose 134% in fiscal year 2016.\n\nIn the Yuma sector, which covers the southwestern corner of Arizona and the southeastern corner of California, the Border Patrol apprehended 6,169 family members, most of them from Central America, in fiscal year 2016. That is a 256% increase from the 1,734 family members apprehended the year before, according to Border Patrol statistics. It's also up 814% from the 675 caught in fiscal year 2014.\n\nThe Border Patrol's Yuma sector also has seen a big spike in unaccompanied minors. Border Patrol agents in that area apprehended 3,266 minors in fiscal year 2016. That is up 200% from the 1,090 caught in fiscal year 2015 and up 830% from the 351 minors caught in fiscal year 2014, according to Border Patrol statistics.\n\nIn the Tucson sector, which stretches from the New Mexico line west to near Yuma, the Border Patrol caught 3,139 family members, and 6,302 unaccompanied minors in fiscal year 2016. That is a 7% and a 5% increase respectively, from fiscal year 2015.\n\nSome more numbers:\n\n\u2022 Border-wide, apprehensions of families are up 95% in fiscal year 2016, and apprehensions of minors are up 49%.\n\n\u2022 The 77,674 family members apprehended border-wide in fiscal year 2016 exceeds the 68,445 caught in fiscal year 2014, the year of the surge.\n\n\u2022 The 59,692 unaccompanied minors apprehended in 2016, however, fell below the 68,541 unaccompanied minors caught in 2014.\n\nThe rise in Central American migrants this year is primarily the result of an ongoing security crisis in the Northern Triangle countries, said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Latin American migration at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human-rights organization.\n\n\"We are increasingly hearing stories both at the U.S.-Mexico border and also from migrant shelters in Mexico of entire families that their lives are so much in danger that they pick up and take everybody and are looking for protection,\" she said.\n\nSome also may have been spurred by President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to build a wall along the entire length of the border to stop illegal immigration from Mexico, she said.\n\n\"I certainly would not doubt that smugglers who have been very skilled at playing into people's fears may have inspired some families to come now rather than later on,\" she said.\n\nThe spike in apprehensions of family members and unaccompanied minors in areas besides the Rio Grande Valley, including Yuma and El Paso, are signs that smugglers are finding new ways to evade Mexican immigration authorities, Meyer said.\n\nUnder pressure from the United States, the Mexican government increased immigration enforcement along its southern border with Guatemala along routes taken by Central American migrants, she said. That led to a drop in 2015 in the number of Central American migrants able to reach the United States by traveling though Mexico, she said.\n\nThe reason numbers are up again in 2016 is because so many people are leaving the Northern Triangle, and because smugglers have figured out ways of getting around Mexico's enforcement efforts, \"either by developing new routes, or figuring out who to pay off,\" Meyer said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 25, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.25531911849976, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 973, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.99822881961, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 25, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161118180000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.9054470709147, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2017/01/16/4-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-minimum-wage/96389778/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "4 things you didn't know about the minimum wage", "wordcount_as_scraped": 708, "date": "20170116180000", "story_content": "The minimum wage has been a highly debated topic in recent years, with workers in industries including fast food and retail pushing for the standard to be raised to $15 an hour.\n\nCurrently, the federal minimum wage is less than half that amount, at $7.25 an hour, where it has been since 2009. Of course, 29 states, plus the District of Columbia and a number of cities and counties, mandate that higher hourly amounts be paid.\n\nStill, while many parts of the country have higher minimum wages, a recent Pew Research Center survey found that 52% of Americans favored increasing the federal minimum to $15 an hour. It's an issue that's divided across party lines: Only 21% of Donald Trump supporters favor the idea, while 82% of Hillary Clinton backers support it. It's also a topic that breaks down differently across racial lines, with \"large majorities of blacks and Hispanics\" supporting it and 54% of whites opposing it, according to Pew.\n\nUnder a Trump administration and a Republican-led Congress, it seems unlikely that any significant increases to the minimum wage will happen on a federal level any time soon. Perhaps that would be different if elected officials in both parties considered the following four facts.\n\nWhile there is a perception that minimum wage jobs go to teenagers working at fast food restaurants, that's only a piece of the picture, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Only 45% of the 2.6 million hourly workers who made federal minimum wage (or less) in 2016 were between 16 and 24 years old. Another 23.3% were aged 25-34, meaning that 31.7% of all hourly workers making minimum wage or less were over 34.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, the federal minimum wage had its peak buying power in 1968, when it was worth $8.68 in 2016 dollars. \"Since it was last raised in 2009, to the current $7.25 per hour, the federal minimum has lost about 9.6% of its purchasing power to inflation,\" according to Pew.\n\nNot only do 29 states plus the District of Columbia have higher minimum wages than the federal standard, but 12 automatically raise theirs based on a cost-of-living formula. States whose minimum wages exceed the federal limit require hourly wages of between $7.50 (in New Mexico) and $11.50 (in D.C.), according to the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division.\n\n\"Together, these states include about 61% of the nation's working-age (16 and over) population,\" according to Pew's analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nA number of cities also have higher minimum wages than even their states. These include San Francisco ($15 by 2018), Seattle ($15 by 2021), Chicago ($13 by 2019), and San Diego ($11.50 by 2017), according to the National Employment Law Project.\n\nIt will not surprise you to find out the restaurant and food service industry employs the most near-minimum-wage workers \u2013 that is employees, who make more than the minimum wage in their state but less than $10.10 an hour. \"The near-minimum-wage workers are young (just under half are 30 or younger), mostly white (76%), and more likely to be female (54%) than male (46%),\" wrote Pew. \"A majority (56%) have no more than a high-school education.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that restaurants, which employ 3.7 million of this type of worker, have some employees who are tipped. These figures do not factor that in, so it's possible that a number of these employees make more than near-minimum wage.\n\nThat's likely not true for the 902,400 grocery store workers, 650,200 department/discount employees, or 633,100 construction workers who qualify as near-minimum-wage workers. In addition, there are 562,900 people making less than $10.10 an hour working in elementary and secondary schools.\n\nOffer from the Motley Fool: The $15,834 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Instead, the White House's chief strategist, white nationalist Steve Bannon, outranks all three in the NSC and its powerful Principals Committee.\n\nTrump is often compared with Richard Nixon, and with good reason. This latest move invites another valid comparison.\n\nLike Trump, whom intelligence officials presented with a dossier of embarrassing information about himself, Nixon had real and imagined gripes with the nation's intelligence community. He believed the Eastern elitists in the CIA looked down on him and cost him the 1960 election against John F. Kennedy.\n\nAfter he won the 1968 presidential election, in part by sabotaging the Paris peace talks to end the Vietnam War, Nixon tried to put the CIA in its place. He ordered a restructuring of the NSC that ran all critical national security decisions through the White House. That plan would have left the CIA director, then Richard Helms, out of the NSC completely.\n\nIt took Melvin Laird, the Defense secretary and a canny former House member, to talk Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security adviser, out of it. Kissinger persuaded Nixon to include Helms in the NSC. Nixon, however, had one condition: Helms could brief the council at the top of its meetings but then would have to leave.\n\nThat condition was deemed too counterproductive and humiliating, and Nixon soon let Helms brief and stay in the meetings. He never trusted the CIA and often ignored its work, most prominently in the days before the 1970 invasion of Cambodia and the disastrous U.S.-backed Lam Son 719 operation in which South Vietnamese troops invaded Laos in 1971. After Lam Son, Nixon tried to blame the CIA when it was Nixon himself who had ignored their advice.\n\nNow Trump has put on paper what Nixon had only tried to do. Saturday's memorandum sidelines three of the nation's top security officials. It's possible all three will participate in all critical meetings, but they will only do so at the explicit invitation of the president or his national security adviser. That shows the intelligence community that its leaders are considered optional, not integral, as the United States copes with the demands of an ever-changing world.\n\nEven more problematic is that they rank below someone whose previous job was running a website that featured bigoted, xenophobic and misogynistic headlines and drew an alt-right readership prone to falling for conspiracy theories. Bannon is reportedly behind some of Trump's most controversial moves, including the inclusion of Green Card holders in the restrictions on visas for visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nSo far, Trump has trumpeted his belief in imaginary voter fraud that he believes cost him the popular vote in last year's election. He cites the so far invisible proof of an app maker that traffics in false voter fraud claims. This president, perhaps more than any other, needs the advice and counsel of our intelligence community and military leaders.\n\nNixon's fate provides a valuable lesson. His order restructuring the NSC created multiple political and policy disputes. It spurred a series of leaks to the press that led Nixon to spy on his own staff and journalists. Eventually the top officers of the military set up a spy ring inside the White House to learn what Nixon was hiding from them. Nixon was covering up all these skeletons when the Watergate break-in occurred on June 17, 1972, and started an even larger cover-up that eventually forced him to resign two years later.\n\nThat fate, which Nixon could have avoided, was triggered by a fateful reorganization of the NSC and a disregard for intelligence. Trump, with his order, is following the same path. A few edits and additions to the organizational chart could change that. The new president, however, has already sent a message to the intelligence community and the world about what he really values.\n\nRay Locker is the Washington enterprise editor of USA TODAY and author of Nixon's Gamble: How a President's Own Secret Government Destroyed His Administration.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 20, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.94884288311005, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 733, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.73808503202, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170129230000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.59345156889495, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/humankind/2016/11/24/farmer-building-farm-low-income-inner-city/94220234/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00bd": [582]}}, "headline": "Farmer building farm in low income inner-city", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1467, "date": "20161124100000", "story_content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- When Jonathan Lawler decided to turn his Greenfield farm into a mission to feed the hungry last spring, he had no idea how he would touch the lives of people living on the north side of Indianapolis.\n\nToday, Lawler of Brandywine Creek Farms is working with staff at Flanner House community center to develop the state's largest urban farm in the heart of one of the city's biggest food deserts, areas that lack access to fresh fruit, vegetables and other healthy whole foods.\n\nFlanner Farms will sprout next year on the 2\u00bd-acre campus of Flanner House, 2424 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St. It's not a community garden, but rather a 1.3-acre working farm. And it won't just feed people; it will teach them how to grow their own food.\n\nAccording to statistics provided by Gleaners Food Bank, 1 in 8 people in Central and southeastern Indiana struggles with hunger and food insecurity; that number grows to 1 in 6 in Marion County. Of the 170,820 people in Marion County who lack consistent access to enough food, 51,440 are children, according to Map the Meal Gap 2015, compiled by Feeding America.\n\n\"My job as a farmer is to feed the world, and we have people going hungry in my backyard,\" Lawler said. The 40-year-old father of three turned about half of his 36-acre Hancock County farm over to his nonprofit operation \u2014 growing corn, beans, zucchini, tomatoes and watermelon for people in need.\n\nHis original goal was to raise a half-million pounds of food; he estimates he hit 420,000 pounds. \"The biggest challenge for us has been getting volunteers when we needed them to harvest,\" he said. \"Some of the food went to waste, and as a farmer, that kills you.\"\n\nStill, he describes the nonprofit farm's first season as \"extremely successful.\" Later in the summer, he turned to machinery to harvest some of his bean and corn crop, and he firmed up his partnership with Gleaners, which dispatched a truck to collect produce whenever the farm had it available. Lawler said his advisory board estimated the monetary value of what was donated at well over $150,000.\n\nOver the summer, Lawler learned about Flanner House and its work to feed surrounding neighborhoods. He and his three sons delivered a truckload of produce to the center, and there he met Brandon Cosby, executive director. It didn't take long for Cosby to see that Lawler would be an ally in his quest to take the 118-year-old center back to its agrarian roots.\n\n\"We are getting back to the historic legacy of Flanner House,\" said Cosby, who took over as executive director earlier this year.\n\nAs Cosby dug into the center's history, he discovered it had a farming program and a cannery as far back as the 1930s. Neighbors learned about urban agriculture and took home what food they needed. The remainder was sold at a co-op.\n\nAs the landscape changed and large grocery stores began popping up to supply easy access to food, the idea of growing your own dinner lost its appeal. But now many of those same groceries are closing, forcing vulnerable populations \u2014 those without access to transportation \u2014 to frequent dollar stores and gas stations for pre-packaged convenience foods.\n\nLast year saw the closing of four Double 8 Foods stores in Indianapolis, one just up the street from Flanner House at 2907 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St.\n\nThe closing was an exclamation point on an issue with which the community was dealing anyway, Cosby said. So rather than lamenting the loss of a store that he said people shopped at only because they had to, he is energized by the possibilities Flanner Farms presents.\n\nMuch more than a garden\n\nOn a recent tour of the property, Cosby points out where the largest part of the farm will operate, just west of the center's parking lot. They'll grow sweet potatoes, kale, onions, okra and more. Toward the front of the center's campus will be raised beds with produce free for the picking. Also planned are native Indiana fruit trees rimming the property, a fresh flower garden, preschool planting operation, a chicken coop, even a cafe and micro grocery.\n\nIn all, the first-year goal is to produce 40,000 pounds of food on-site, with Brandywine committing to another 50,000 to 60,000 pounds \u2014 mostly sweet corn, cucumbers, tomatoes and beans. With that, the center hopes to feed a combined 5,200 households with children in the 46208 and 46205 ZIP codes.\n\nFrom May to September, a weekly farmers market will offer a portion of the farm's organic produce at below-retail prices. The market will operate adjacent to Watkins Park during the weekly Jazz in the Park music series.\n\nResidents of the community will be employed to work the farm, as well as the cafe and grocery. A job-training program, funded in part by a crime-prevention grant from Central Indiana Community Foundation, will give people a fresh start, teaching them food industry skills, including growing, handling, distribution and service, and making them marketable to the city's many restaurants, Cosby said.\n\n\"I just love the idea that some folks who may have been responsible for terrorizing the community will be in the position of feeding the community,\" Cosby said. \"That path to redemption is a really important one, and folks can do it in a very tangible, real way. This is how we're re-creating and stabilizing our community.\"\n\nBuilding a local food system\n\nMat Davis sees the farm as the foundation for a \"just and equitable\" local food system. As Flanner House's food justice coordinator, his responsibilities include getting the farm up and running, chairing the Northwest Quality of Life Food Access Committee and supporting community and residential garden development.\n\n\"We can really start to make some headway in addressing hunger,\" Davis said. He believes that means getting away from the reliance on emergency food aid in the form of pantries and soup kitchens.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"we're creating economic opportunities by working with young people in the neighborhood. Disadvantaged youth can have a viable opportunity to support themselves and their families while feeding their community.\"\n\nThe 22,000 people who live within the geographic area served by Flanner House are primarily African-American, many descended from the estimated 5 million people who were part of the Great Migration from the South to the North (between 1915 and 1960), Cosby said. Many left behind their lives as tenant farmers, sharecroppers and farm hands for better opportunities in the North.\n\n\"These people were responsible for feeding this entire country, and in one generation, we lost the ability to feed ourselves. I'm not OK with that,\" Cosby said. \"We are not only making food more accessible here, but we're giving people the skills to produce it themselves.\"\n\n'Fair and affordable'\n\nFlanner House has an eager partner in Lawler, who is providing the seed, plants and equipment to get Flanner Farms up and running. He's hoping to turn the soil by Thanksgiving, in preparation for planting next spring, but the center first must raise enough money to build a fence around the property. Donations are welcome at Flanner House, 2424 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St., Indianapolis, IN 46208. Or call (317) 925-4231.\n\n\"We are looking at building a food system that works, that's fair and affordable,\" Lawler said, adding that he's gotten backlash from some local farmers and chefs who suggest he is cheapening local food.\n\n\"I'm not, I'm making it affordable. There's a big difference,\" he said. \"We want people to participate in local food and build an economy around it that will revolutionize food access so everybody has the right to it.\"\n\nRight now, the local food movement is a fad, Lawler said. \"And isn't that sad? The way my grandfather farmed and how farming communities in general relied on local food access, that's gone away. I want it to be commonplace again.\"\n\nIn the next growing season, Lawler expects to make the 25-minute drive from Greenfield to Indy's north side frequently with his sons, but he also expects to see youths from the neighborhoods that feed into Flanner House out at his farm. They'll get a taste of planting and harvesting, an experience he hopes will inspire them to want to learn more.\n\n\"If they can take something from seed to fruit, that's going to do wonders for them.\"\n\nSince his story first appeared in IndyStar earlier this year, Lawler has attracted attention from multiple media outlets, as well as farming publications. In his Metallica T-shirt and International Harvester cap during one interview, he squirms a bit under the spotlight, but he keeps returning to his message.\n\n\"People tell me I'm revolutionary. No, I'm just a copycat, copying off what our forefathers did. There's nothing revolutionary about feeding your community.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 25, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.0050251483917199, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1540, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 7.0581996159200004, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 25, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161124100000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.14285714285714, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/03/first-take-ethics-office-congress-sunlight-republicans-ryan-trump/96121100/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 643, "scraper_regex": 683}}, "headline": "Analysis: House fails in a good way to blunt ethics probes", "wordcount_as_scraped": 683, "date": "20170103230000", "story_content": "It was a line buried in an Office of Congressional Ethics report that tipped me off to members of Congress and staff receiving more than 200 improper trips overseas from groups tied to a Turkish cleric now accused of launching a failed coup in Turkey.\n\nUnder the new rules House Republicans approved late Monday then abandoned Tuesday, I never would have seen the report.\n\nThe 2015 OCE report on a May 2013 trip to Azerbaijan by 10 members of Congress and 29 staffers concluded that the travel was not in fact paid for by the non-profit groups that had invited everyone, but by a foreign oil company, which is a violation of House rules. But the report also included an admission from the non-profit groups that they regularly relied on a Turkish organization to provide free travel for Capitol Hill VIPs on trips to Turkey. That allowed me to track down 200 other trips these groups had sponsored over the past decade that had probably all violated House rules.\n\nBut the House Ethics Committee didn't want this report released. The committee had ordered OCE in March 2015 to drop its probe of the Azerbaijan trip, saying it had its own investigation under way, despite the fact that the committee had originally approved the trip for the entire congressional delegation, including Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., who was a member of the Ethics Committee. But OCE refused and proceeded to publish its report over the objections of the Ethics Committee.\n\nUnder the rules changes pushed by House Republicans on Monday night, OCE would have had to stand down.\n\nIt is not the first time OCE has provided information to the public that the Ethics Committee could not or would not release. In 2010, then-congressman Nathan Deal, R-Ga., resigned while the Ethics Committee was reviewing allegations that he had used his congressional office to pressure state officials in Georgia on a vehicle policy that would help his family's auto-salvage business. His resignation meant that the Ethics Committee lost jurisdiction over him, but OCE decided to issue the report anyway, saying it had a right to release to the report on its own. Under the new rules, it would have lost that right.\n\nIn fact, with a handful of exceptions, the only information the public has had about House ethics cases during the past seven years has come from OCE reports. The rules as currently written require that once OCE has referred a matter to Ethics for further review \u2014 since OCE has no ability to rule on violations or issue punishments \u2014 the Ethics Committee has to publicly release the report even if it has made no decision on guilt or innocence. The most common action by Ethics is to release the report and declare that they are still looking onto the matter ... and no conclusion is ever announced. The new rules proposal raised questions about how much of the OCE work would still be public.\n\nSince the OCE was created in 2008, it has publicly released about 70 reports on investigations of members of Congress and staff. By comparison, in 2007, before the OCE was created, the Ethics Committee announced reviews of conduct of four members of Congress. Two cases involved lawmakers who were facing charges in court; the other two were for improper trips taken four years earlier.\n\nOn the Senate side, with no similar independent ethics review body, the Senate Ethics Committee has not publicly announced a single investigation against a senator in nearly 5 years.\n\nIt is not clear exactly how the new proposed rules would have affected ethics investigations, but it is almost certain that the net result would have been that the public would learn less about allegations of ethics violations by their elected officials.\n\n\n\nThis is also not the first \u2014 and probably not the last \u2014 attempt by lawmakers to make it harder for OCE to investigate them. Two years ago, Republicans pushed through a late-night amendment that underscored the need for OCE to protect the due process rights of accused lawmakers. It is not clear that rules change had much impact.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.8131102323532098, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 643, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 16, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.4275620588699995, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170103230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.7325038880248798, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/25/judge-oks-shock-belt-defendant-kidnapping-trial/97057790/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Judge OKs shock belt for defendant in kidnapping trial", "wordcount_as_scraped": 638, "date": "20170125230000", "story_content": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 A defendant facing more than 300 years behind bars in a series of armed kidnappings in a four-state crime spree is dangerous and desperate enough to merit a rare use of a shock belt, a federal judge has ruled.\n\nChief U.S. District Judge Tom Varlan on Tuesday approved a request by the U.S. Marshals Service to outfit Michael Benanti with either a shock belt \u2014 which can be remotely activated \u2014 or shackles around his ankles during what is expected to be a weekslong trial beginning next week in U.S. District Court.\n\nBenanti faces a slew of violent crime and gun charges in connection with a crime spree that spanned four and included three armed kidnappings in Tennessee of the families, including young children, of bank executives in a bid to force those executives to rob their own banks. If convicted of all counts, Benanti would die in prison well before he ever serves the entirety of a sentence that would be more than 300 years long.\n\nThe Marshals Service doesn't comment on security measures. But when the marshals made a rare request to use either a shock belt or leg irons as additional security for Benanti, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Lewen publicly sought Varlan's approval. Visible restraints on a defendant during a jury trial are generally prohibited as it could prejudice jurors against the suspect.\n\nDeputy U.S. Marshal John Sanchez testified Tuesday that Benanti has a violent crime record dating to the early 1990s that included an attempted escape from a federal prison. He used a jail razor to slash his throat and wrists after his arrest in the federal case in November 2015 and expressed what Sanchez said was an unusual level of hatred toward Lewen in recorded jail calls.\n\n\"His voice does concern me, the level of hatred in his voice,\" Sanchez said of the Benanti's recorded conversations with family while behind bars in which Benanti railed against Lewen, saying he should be \"killed.\"\n\nSanchez said he had listened to many other calls Benanti has made since he and co-defendant Brian Witham were nabbed in North Carolina in November 2015.\n\n\"To me, it shows an individual (who) switches ... to somebody who can't control himself,\" Sanchez testified. \"I am concerned in this situation he will let his desperation get the better of him.\"\n\nSanchez also said Benanti has been trying to find out where Witham, who has agreed to testify against him, is being housed.\n\n\"Mr. Witham is going to be in the same courtroom as Mr. Benanti,\" he said. \"This is the closest he's going to be to Mr. Witham.\"\n\nDefense attorneys Robert Kurtz and Richard Gaines argued the marshals could simply beef up the number of their officer for the trial.\n\n\"I don't think any restraints are necessary at this point,\" Kurtz said.\n\nVarlan disagreed.\n\n\"The court finds merely having additional security in the courtroom does not adequately protect the courtroom or deter the defendant,\" he said.\n\nVarlan is ordering the marshals to take measures so that jurors cannot see either the shock belt or leg irons, and he said he is largely leaving it up to the marshals to decide which device is best. But he ordered the marshals to specifically use the shock belt, which will be covered by Benanti's clothing, during jury selection Monday because that process will make it tougher to hide leg shackles from view.\n\nBenanti and Witham met while both were serving federal prison terms in the 1990s. Authorities allege Benanti later recruited Witham on what turned out to be a violent crime spree in which masked suspects secretly watched the families of bank executives and then confronted them at gunpoint in their homes. The families, including children, were often bound and sometimes blindfolded and threatened with death if the bank executives did not do the suspects' bidding.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.53623199462891, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 629, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.31416764752, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125230000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.3386327503974598, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/11/18/election-audit-paper-machines-column/93803752/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 932, "scraper_regex": 874}}, "headline": "Still time for an election audit: Column", "wordcount_as_scraped": 874, "date": "20161118140000", "story_content": "A Washington Post\u2013ABC News poll found that 18% of voters \u2014 33% of Clinton supporters and 1% of Trump supporters \u2014 think Trump was not the legitimate winner of the election. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has called on Congress to investigate the Russian cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee and the election.\n\nThere are reasons for concern. According to the director of national intelligence, the leaked emails from the DNC were \"intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\" The director of national intelligence, the Department of Homeland Security, and the National Security Agency concluded that the Russian government is behind the DNC email hack and that Russian hackers attacked U.S. voter registration databases.\n\nWe know that the national results could be tipped by manipulating the vote count in a relatively small number of jurisdictions \u2014 a few dozen spread across a few key states. We know that the vast majority of local elections officials have limited resources to detect or defend against cyberattacks. And while pre-election polls have large uncertainties, they were consistently off. And various aspects of the preliminary results, such as a high rate of undervotes for president, have aroused suspicion.\n\nComputers counted the vast majority of the 130 million votes cast in this year's election. Even without hacking, mistakes are inevitable. Computers can't divine voter intent perfectly; computers can be misconfigured; and software can have bugs.\n\nDid human error, computer glitches, hacking, or other problems change the outcome? While there is, as yet, no compelling evidence, the news about hacking and deliberate interference makes it worth finding out.\n\nAbout 25% of voters used machines that do not generate a paper trail. Any hacking, glitches or other errors that affected their votes could be undetectable. But the other 75% of the vote, including the key states of Michigan and Wisconsin, could be double-checked in various ways.\n\nA full manual recount of the paper records would be definitive, but that's unnecessarily difficult, expensive and time-consuming if the results are actually right.\n\nThere's an easier way: an audit that manually examines a random sample of the ballots in a way that has a large chance of detecting and correcting incorrect results. This is called a \"risk-limiting\" audit. If the reported winner of a contest really won, a risk-limiting audit generally needs to examine only a small fraction of the ballots. But if the reported winner actually lost, a risk-limiting audit has a large chance of indicating that a full hand count is needed to set the record straight.\n\nRisk-limiting audits are a crucial check on election integrity and accuracy even when elections are not controversial and margins are wide. They have been endorsed by the Presidential Commission on Election Administration and many organizations concerned with election integrity. Colorado law requires risk-limiting audits starting in 2017, and California law requires them for deploying some new voting systems.\n\nThere is no federal law mandating election audits. A number of states perform some kind of audit, but our research shows those audits have little or no chance of detecting and correcting erroneous results. To audit this election effectively will require immediate legal action.\n\nAuditing surprisingly few ballots could give 95% confidence that the results are correct in every state: about 1.5 million ballots in all, a bit over 1% of the ballots cast.\n\nBut if we just want to check whether Donald Trump won the election, an audit might examine even fewer ballots, because it could proceed in stages.\n\nFirst it would check the results in the states Trump won. If auditing confirms those results, there's no need to audit in the states Clinton carried: Trump really won. That means auditing about 700,000 ballots in the 29 states Trump won, about 0.5% of the ballots cast in this election.\n\nHow could checking just 0.5% of the ballots give such high confidence?\n\nStates where the contest wasn't close probably won't have to check many ballots. If their results are right, even a small random sample is likely to have a majority for Trump that would be implausible if Clinton had actually won.\n\nMissouri had such a wide margin that examining just 10 ballots should give high confidence. Texas would need to check about 700.\n\nThe few states where the contest was tight would have to do more work. Michigan had the smallest margin among states that Trump carried. To get 95% confidence there would require checking about 11% of the ballots.\n\nIt does not take much technology to conduct these audits: dice (to select random ballots), a pencil and paper, and access to the paper ballots. The calculations are simple addition and subtraction. They could be done by a fifth-grader. No programming would be required.\n\nThere is still time to audit this election \u2014 barely. States only have until Dec. 13 to give their final results to the Electoral College.\n\nAmericans should demand this simple step to ensure that the machinery of democracy worked.

In addition, about 20 students walked out of Valley High in West Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nThe schools in Iowa's largest city allowed the student-organized protests, which lasted 15 to 45 minutes, giving participants unexcused absences.\n\n\"Our students have the right to be heard,\" Des Moines Public Schools administrators said.\n\nOther high-schoolers also left class to rally against Trump's anti-immigration stance, hate speech and misogyny:\n\n\u2022 In the San Francisco area, about half of Berkeley High School's student body \u2014 1,500 students \u2014 walked out before 9 a.m. PT, KNTV-TV, San Jose, Calif., reported. Three other high schools, Oakland Technical and Bishop O'Dowd in Oakland and Lincoln High in San Jose also had walkouts.\n\n\"They're angry,\" said Berkeley High Principal Sam Pasarow, who did not want students to be interviewed directly. \"They're crying and they feel unsafe.\"\n\n\u2022 In the Phoenix area, hundreds of students from several high schools left class, marched through downtown and met at the Arizona Capitol. They held signs and Mexican flags and chanted, \"Who's Donald Trump? Not our president\" and \"Whose city? Our city!\" The Arizona Republic reported. This followed a Tuesday afternoon protest at two high schools, North and Maryvale.\n\n\u2022 In the Santa Barbara, Calif., area, students at three high schools \u2014 Dos Pueblos, Santa Barbara and San Marcos \u2014 walked off campus at mid-day to march to the Santa Barbara County Courthouse for a rally. Two pro-Trump students, one wearing a Trump T-shirt, were sworn at and authorities escorted them a few blocks to the main police station, according to KEYT-TV, Santa Barbara.\n\n\u2022 In Seattle, about 200 students from West Seattle High walked out of school and marched through the streets chanting, \"Save our future\" and \"Not my president,\" reported KING-TV, Seattle.\n\n\u2022 In Boulder, Colo., about 100 students left class at Boulder High to gather on the front lawn of the school then began to walk toward downtown, the (Boulder) Daily Camera reported. At the front of the group, some students carried a large sign, \"Honk for Love.\"\n\nOf the high schools in a half dozen areas of the country whose students participated, more than three-fourths have enrollment that is mostly minorities, according to federal data. At least a third had overwhelmingly Hispanic student bodies.\n\n\"The majority of students at Des Moines Public Schools are students of color,\" Phil Roeder, the district's director of communications & public affairs, said in a statement. \"The rhetoric of this past election has caused many concerns and divisions among them, their friends and their families. The school district will not stand in the way of our students peacefully expressing their concerns.\"\n\nIn Des Moines, teens used social media to coordinate the 10:30 a.m. CT walkout, which coincided with the concession speech of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Students designated leaders to start chants and reminded them to be respectful although protests devolved at times into cursing and obscene gestures.\n\n\"There's a lot of tension,\" said organizer Jalesha Johnson, a senior at East. \"I wanted to show that this generation does care, and we won't sit quietly when we have an opportunity to say something.\"\n\nTeens expressed concern about what a Trump presidency would mean for black, Hispanic or Muslim family members and friends. Others worried about his attitude toward women.\n\n\"I never felt like I feared anything in the United States,\" said Roosevelt senior Nosa Ali, a Sudanese refugee who is Muslim. \"It's hard to describe in words.\"\n\nNot all parents were pleased with the protest or that the school district notified them just minutes before it occurred. About 52% of Iowa voters chose Trump, rewarding him with the state's six electoral votes.\n\nSome teens said the walkouts divided schools.\n\n\"It's like you get judged if you like Trump,\" said Noah Christensen, a senior at Roosevelt who worked on homework instead.\n\nTeachers were urged to stay neutral and provide classroom supervision, Roeder said. One school message said staff could participate but reminded them to be professional.\n\nStudent protesters were eager to show their disdain for the president-elect.\n\n\"I go to school with so many people of color, and when (Trump) sees their faces, he doesn't see what I see,\" said Hoover senior Oddessey Whitaker, 17, who is black. \"He shouldn't be the president of the United States.\"\n\nSeveral hundred students walked out of East, linking arms and chanting \"No justice, no peace!\" and \"Undocumented and unafraid!\" Some held up the Mexican flag.\n\nThe group left school grounds and marched into neighborhoods as teachers tried to get them to come back.

Now, Donald Trump is positioned to make it more conservative, possibly for generations to come.\n\nBut that change won't happen immediately.\n\nFrom his much-publicized list of 21 potential high court nominees, Trump isn't likely to find a more reliable conservative than the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat Republicans refused to fill for the past eight months. Following any political skirmish in the Senate, the man or woman who replaces Scalia on the bench won't change its balance of power.\n\nTrump's more lasting impact is dependent on the other eight justices, particularly those old enough to favor retirement or risk dying in office. Liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are 83 and 78, respectively. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who often sides with liberals on major cases, is 80. If the president-elect gets to replace any of them after taking office, the court will shift to the right.\n\n\"The Supreme Court is what it's all about,\" Trump said in the last presidential debate. He vowed to name justices who \"will not do damage to the Second Amendment\" and allow decisions on abortion rights \"to go back to the states.\"\n\nDespite winning the prize Tuesday night, Trump won't change the direction of the court anytime soon. While it will remain in conservative hands \u2014 emboldening Chief Justice John Roberts and leaving Kennedy as the ultimate decider \u2014 even one or two Trump appointments likely would not cause a sudden move to strike down Supreme Court precedents such as those preserving abortion rights and the use of racial preferences.\n\nAnd on issues such as campaign finance rules, gun rights and religious liberty, the court generally has sided with conservative positions in recent years. \"The court is pretty conservative now, so there's not a lot of room to go,\" says David Strauss, a high court scholar at the University of Chicago Law School.\n\nWhat could change in the short term is the court's occasional willingness to step into disputes conservatives feel are better left to the states. That could spell doom for some of Obama's forays into areas such as health care, immigration and environmental protection.\n\nTrump's nominee to replace Scalia isn't likely to face the type of opposition from Democrats that Republicans mounted against President Obama's choice, federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland. Despite Garland's moderate disposition and relatively advanced age of 63, his ascendance would have created a liberal court for the first time in nearly 50 years.\n\nThat appeared to concern many Trump voters. In exit polls Tuesday, one in five voters who said the Supreme Court was important to them called it \"the most important factor\" in their vote. They sided with Trump, 56% to 41%.\n\n\"Trump's decisive, map-realigning victory, was in large part won by his focus on the Supreme Court issue,\" said Ken Blackwell, a former Ohio state treasurer and conservative leader. \"The American people showed their rejection and disdain for adding more liberals to the court by voting to re-elect a Republican Senate.\"\n\nOnce Trump nominates someone, Democrats can try to block confirmation. But having failed to capture control of the Senate on Tuesday, they can only succeed through a filibuster \u2014 using their minority power to block a vote. If that happens, Republicans can change the Senate rules just as Democrats did in 2013 for lower court judges and confirm Trump's choice without needing the 60 votes required to break filibusters.\n\nSupreme Court justices serve lifetime appointments. Most choose to retire when a like-minded president can replace them. That has happened with the past six nominees \u2014 two each for Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama.\n\nOnly in one of those cases did the court shift significantly. That happened when Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, like Kennedy a moderate jurist, was replaced by the more conservative Samuel Alito in 2006. And not since Justice Thurgood Marshall retired in 1991 and was replaced by Clarence Thomas has the court moved dramatically to the right.\n\nIt is for that reason that some Democrats had urged Ginsburg to retire during Obama's presidency \u2014 a suggestion she rejected because she felt up to the job and did not believe he could get a suitable replacement through the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nNow, having survived two bouts with cancer, she finds herself in the same precarious position as Marshall a quarter century ago \u2014 balancing her ideological preferences against her physical health under a president-to-be she recently called \"a faker\" with \"no consistency about him.\" She later called her comments \"ill-advised.\"\n\nIf Ginsburg and Breyer, who appears healthy and has shown no sign of retiring, do not leave the court anytime soon, Trump may not have many chances to shift the court further to the right. The other more liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, are relatively young at 62 and 56, respectively. Replacing Roberts, Thomas or Alito, all in their 60s, would not alter the balance.\n\nThat leaves Kennedy, the longest-serving justice on the court and the only one dating back to the Reagan administration. Despite his conservative credentials, he has joined liberals on some of the biggest social justice rulings during his tenure \u2014 most notably in the last few years by creating a right to same-sex marriage and preserving abortion rights and affirmative action policies.\n\nThose positions are anathema to conservatives who, like Scalia, favor a strict reading of the Constitution and federal law. Trump said during the last debate that he chose his potential justices based on that criteria. \"It's all about the Constitution \u2014 the way it was meant to be,\" he said.\n\nHow closely he sticks by the list is anyone's guess. When he first named 11 potential justices in May \u2014 with the help of the conservative Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, a group Scalia helped to found in 1982 \u2014 he pledged to select his nominee from among them. Then he added 10 more names in September.\n\nThe group includes 17 men and four women, including one African American, one Hispanic and one South Asian judge. All appear to be reliably conservative \u2014 unlike many Republican presidents' past nominees who turned out to be liberals, such as former Justices John Paul Stevens and David Souter, or moderates, such as Kennedy and O'Connor.\n\nDepending on the nominee's age and health, he or she could fill Scalia's seat until the middle of the century \u2014 long after Trump, in all likelihood, is dead and gone.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.462962955236435, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 760, "FairnessVirtue": 14, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.0451991747800005, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161109170000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8947368421052597, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/06/fact-check-nancy-pelosi-stretches-aca-claims/96248458/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1535, "scraper_regex": 1633}}, "headline": "Fact check: Nancy Pelosi stretches ACA claims", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1633, "date": "20170106200000", "story_content": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made some misleading claims this week on the Affordable Care Act:\n\n\u2022 Pelosi exaggerated in saying \"75% of the American people \u2026 get their health benefits through their workplace.\" Around 50% of the total population has employer-sponsored insurance.\n\n\u2022 Pelosi also claimed Republicans would use $800 billion in Medicare savings to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy rather than to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund, as the ACA now does. But keeping the Medicare savings would still prolong the life of the trust fund, whether the GOP also enacts tax cuts or not.\n\nPelosi held a Jan. 2 conference call to discuss the impact of the Affordable Care Act and Republicans' plans to repeal the law, and spoke again at a Jan. 4 press conference. As Pelosi and other Democratic lawmakers stated repeatedly, about 20 million people have gained health insurance since the law was passed. That's an administration estimate of the impact of the law, but other estimates back that up. The National Center for Health Statistics surveys also show a 20 million drop in the number of uninsured since 2010, when the law was passed. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House repeal plan in 2015 would increase the number of the uninsured by 22 million after 2017.\n\nBut other claims by Pelosi aren't so solid.\n\nEmployer-Based Insurance\n\nDemocrats have stressed in the past that the ACA isn't a government-run health care system, but instead it builds upon the work-based insurance system that already existed in the country. And that's accurate. But Pelosi greatly exaggerated the percentage of Americans with employer-based coverage when she argued that repealing the law would hurt all Americans.\n\n\"This is not just about the 20 million previously uninsured Americans who now have health security, but that would be good justification \u2014 but this is about the 75% of the American people who get their health benefits through their workplace, not through the ACA, but who gets increased benefits through the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nPelosi repeated that 75% figure twice more in the conference call, and used it again in a Jan. 4 press conference. It's a much higher percentage than we had heard before.\n\nThe nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 49% of the total population had employer health insurance coverage in 2015. KFF figures are based on the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey for March.\n\nSeparately, the Census Bureau issues an annual report, the latest of which found that 55.7% of the population had employer-based insurance for part or all of 2015.\n\nWhen we inquired, Pelosi's office told us she was referring to the percentage of working adults, excluding seniors, and that the figure came from a staff analysis of the Census Bureau's report for 2014. The Census figures for that year show 78.8% of all workers, both full-time and part-time, had private health insurance. Pelosi's staff lowered that to 75% to account for those buying private insurance on the ACA exchanges or on the individual market.\n\nBut there is Census data for this very specific subset \u2014 working adults under 65 with employer insurance. The \"all races\" Excel tables here show that 71% of all workers, age 18-64, who worked part-time or full-time, had employment-based coverage in 2014 and in 2015 (see line 244).\n\nThat's close to the figure Pelosi used, but it does not represent the percentage of \"the American people\" with employer-based coverage, as she repeatedly said.\n\nPelosi went on to say that there had been slower growth in costs for those with employer coverage since the ACA was enacted: \"The impact on that 75% is also significant in terms of controlling the increase in costs which was so dramatic before the ACA and has drastically been reduced.\"\n\nShe made a similar claim in a Jan. 4 press conference, saying that \"the cost increase in premiums is the lowest it has been in the 50-some years that they had been tracking that. So, it has contained cost.\"\n\nAs we've written before, the growth in premiums \u2014 and national health care spending overall \u2014 has been at low or moderate rates for several years, though it's not clear how much of an impact the ACA has had on the slowdown. The recession and slowly recovering economy have played a role, experts say.\n\nPremiums for employer-sponsored family plans have grown at an average 3% or 4% per year since 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's annual Employer Health Benefits Survey. The surveys also show premiums grew by an average 3% from 2009 to 2010, the year the ACA was enacted, and by 5% from 2008 to 2009. Premiums jumped up by 9% in 2011, with a small part of that due to increased benefits under the ACA, experts told us at the time.\n\nFor the \"dramatic\" cost increases that Pelosi mentions, we have to go back to the early half of the 2000s. As a graphic from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows, family premiums went up an average 63% from 2001 to 2006, an average 31% from 2006 to 2011, and just an average 20% from 2011 to 2016.\n\nThe country has seen low rates of overall health spending growth, too \u2014 that growth was 4.1% or less per year from 2009 through 2013, a rate that the journal Health Affairs said was the lowest since the National Health Expenditure Accounts data was first compiled in 1960 by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nBut spending grew 5.8% in 2015. Experts with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have said that the ACA has had a \"minimal\" impact on the slowdown in growth. It was largely the economy that affected the growth of health spending, and it's the economy that is expected to increase that growth.\n\nJason Furman, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an Oct. 7, 2015, speech that \"the recent slow growth in health care costs has a variety of causes,\" including the recession, private-sector efforts to control health care costs \"even before the recession hit and the Affordable Care Act was enacted,\" and the Affordable Care Act. Furman said the law's reductions in Medicare spending had a \"spillover effect\" on overall health care spending, calling the ACA \"a major reason\" for slow growth.\n\nIn September, after the KFF employer survey again showed low growth in average family premiums, Furman and the Council of Economic Adviser's Matt Fiedler wrote in a White House blog post that \"there is evidence that the Great Recession placed downward pressure on health care cost growth in the early years of the recovery,\" but that the continued slow growth in premiums and spending was evidence that it was \"increasingly likely that structural changes in the health care system \u2014 including changes in public policy and other factors that would have a persistent effect on health care spending over the long run \u2014 are the primary reasons health care cost growth remains low today.\"\n\nPelosi is right that premiums for work-based coverage have generally grown at slower rates since the ACA was enacted than years past, but the law isn't the only reason experts have cited for that slowdown.\n\nThe ACA's Medicare Savings\n\nPelosi accused Republicans of using savings from Medicare to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy.\n\n\"So, in their budget, they have the voucherizing of Medicare, they take 800 billion dollars of savings from Medicare, which we use to prolong the life, close the donut hole and provide more benefits for seniors. They take that and give it as a tax break to the wealthiest people in our country,\" she said.\n\n\"Voucherizing\" refers to Rep. Paul Ryan's years-long proposal to create a premium-support system for future Medicare beneficiaries, in which seniors would get government subsidies for their health care and then choose from traditional Medicare and private plans on a new Medicare exchange.\n\nReaders of FactCheck.org may be familiar with the $800 billion in Medicare savings. That's the Affordable Care Act's cut in the future growth of Medicare spending over 10 years. (See Table 4 of the CBO's June 2015 report on the effects of repealing the ACA.) The reduction in spending primarily comes from a reduction in the growth of future payments to hospitals through Medicare Part A; savings also come from changing future payment rates for Medicare Advantage, which provides benefits through private insurance.\n\nPelosi is correct to say that this reduction in spending prolongs the life of Part A, or the hospital insurance trust fund, which is primarily funded by payroll taxes. The Medicare trustees' 2010 report estimated that the ACA had added 12 years to the life of the trust fund.\n\nBut to be clear, if Republicans keep that reduction in Medicare spending, the life of the trust fund is still extended. That doesn't change.\n\nPelosi is free to criticize the Republicans for reversing course. The GOP has long criticized the $800 billion in savings, calling it a cut or even a \"raid\" on Medicare. But now, just as Ryan has proposed in the past, congressional Republicans may keep the Medicare savings \u2014 if they don't, they'd be increasing government spending.\n\nAnd Pelosi is free to criticize the Republicans' plans for tax breaks \u2014 another part of Ryan's past budget plans. But we don't know what exactly Republicans will propose just yet. The budget resolution introduced in the Senate this week only gives spending and revenue guidelines, and doesn't delve into any tax plan. It's up to congressional committees to write legislation that fills in the details on how those budget guidelines would be met.\n\nRegardless of any tax changes, if the ACA Medicare savings, or most of them, stay in effect, the life of the trust fund would still be extended, because less money would be spent from the fund than would have been without those savings.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.2716763019561799, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1535, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 7.18929415264, "HarmVirtue": 24, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 51, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170106200000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.32247557003257, "mft_mean": 4.63636363636}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2017/01/21/harry-s-truman-library-impersonator/96847748/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1240, "scraper_regex": 1117}}, "headline": "What would Harry Truman say about Trump?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1117, "date": "20170121150000", "story_content": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2013 In a recent interview, the late Harry S.

It was how I looked, and my interest in history.\"\n\nThat would have been in the early 1960s, after Starzmann moved to the Kansas City area to attend Park University. It was the first of six meetings with the former president \u2014 but they were already acquainted.\n\nWhen Starzmann was a 10-year-old in Philadelphia, a teacher instilled in him a love of history. \"I learned that when you're no longer in the limelight, you become available \u2014 so I wrote hundreds of letters to people who made history.\"\n\nMany statesmen and scholars responded. Many still do.\n\nThe avowed political junkie lives in a brownstone in Kansas City's Midtown area. Most walls in his large apartment are lined with filled bookshelves; by his count, he owns 2,000 to 5,000 titles that deal with the presidency. Some of his collection is stored off-site.\n\nA key difference: Starzmann terms himself \"a historian who happens to also be an interpreter.\"\n\nHis morph into an onstage HST began around 1990, when a woman who did a solo show about first lady Bess Truman was looking for a partner to play second fiddle. But his role grew when \"people started asking me questions ... and I could answer them.\" That led to Starzmann-Truman throwing his own hat in the ring: \"It's amazing how many people like Harry Truman.\"\n\nThese days, he does appearances at the Truman library/museum and presentations at Kansas City-area schools. He has performed from Vermont to California, and addressed the Mount Rushmore Memorial Society, the Smithsonian Associates and the Mount Vernon Society. Corporate gigs have included speaking at a convention of Deloitte Touche, the international accounting/consulting giant.\n\nWhen groups or firms call the Truman library/museum seeking a flesh-and-blood Truman for an event, they're likely to be referred to raymondstarzmann.com.\n\nThe performances \u2014 90 minutes or so \u2014 are extemporaneous, heavy with audience give-and-take. His approach varies. \"For kids, you have to answer very comfortably; you don't talk about the Marshall Plan, you talk about when Truman was young.\"\n\nFor adults? \"It varies. For the most part, I don't get stupid questions.\"\n\nTruman was known to have a temper and, when angered, a salty tongue. He repeatedly clashed with Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who Truman found arrogant and insubordinate and who he fired during the Korean War.\n\nHow does Starzmann handle that? With restraint when women and children are present: HST was always careful with his Ps and Qs when his wife \u2014 always called \"Mrs. Truman\" \u2014 was around.\n\nOtherwise, Starzmann gives a version of HST's famous quote: \"I fired him because he wouldn't respect the authority of the president ... I didn't fire him because he was a dumb son of a bitch, although he was, but that's not against the law for generals. If it was, half to three-quarters of them would be in jail.\"\n\nInformally, the president and tribute actor occasionally merge: Ask Starzmann a question about Truman and the answer might be in the presidential first-person.\n\nKnowing Truman and what that president said on a range of subjects, it was easy for the costumed re-enactor to comment on Trump. But asked a time-tripping question in an audience setting, the answer is apt to be a plain-spoken \"I don't know.\"\n\nStarzmann's interest in high-level politics spans centuries and parties. He got to know Alf Landon, the Republican governor of Kansas who lost in a landslide to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election. A grouping of items from Starzmann's massive collection of political pins was featured on the cover of a program for the 1976 Republican National Convention, held in Kansas City.\n\nPermanent exhibits at The Truman Library & Museum include Truman: The Presidential Years and the personal Harry S. Truman: His Life and Times. Other programs are scheduled throughout the year.\n\nThe restoration followed the most enduring Truman tweak to 1900 Pennsylvania Avenue: The 1948 addition of the second-floor balcony overlooking the South Lawn. Though the balcony was aesthetically controversial at the time, the White House Museum (whitehousemuseum.org) notes that it \"was an improvement in both form and function.\"\n\nMore information: raymondstarzmann.com,trumanlibrary.org\n\nThere are 13 presidential libraries/museums in operation, for each president from Herbert Hoover (1929-1933) to George W.

I believe in the American people,\" Obama said in a warm farewell to reporters. \"I believe that people are more good than bad. I believe tragic things happen. I think there's evil in the world. But I think at the end of the day, if we work hard and if we're true to those things in us that feel true and feel right, that the world gets a little better each time.\n\n\"That's what this presidency has tried to be about,\" he said.\n\nObama used his last news conference to defend his decision to release Army Private Chelsea Manning, convicted of espionage for leaking secrets to Wikileaks \u2014as in the interests of justice. \"I looked at the particulars of this case the same way I have the other commutations and pardons that I've done. And I felt that in light of all the circumstances, that commuting her sentence was entirely appropriate,\" he said.\n\nAnd he left with some words for the White House press corps. \"You're not supposed to be sycophants, you're supposed to be skeptics. You're supposed to ask me tough questions. You're not supposed to be complimentary, but you're supposed to cast a critical eye on folks who hold enormous power and make sure that we are accountable to the people who sent us here,\" he said. \"And you have done that.\"\n\nBut in a crowded White House briefing room Wednesday, Obama carefully selected reporters from foreign and specialty news outlets, all but ensuring he would answer questions on immigration, the Middle East, gay rights and race relations.\n\nIn perhaps his strongest language, he condemned efforts to restrict voting and dismissed reports of widespread voter fraud as \"fake news.\"\n\n\"There's an ugly history to that that we should not be shy about talking about. Yes, I'm talking about voting rights,\" Obama said. \"It traces directly back to Jim Crow and the legacy of slavery, and it became acceptable to restrict the franchise. That's not who we are. That shouldn't be who we are. That's not how America works best.\"\n\nIn keeping with an unabashedly optimistic tone as he winds down his presidency, Obama also acknowledged that the country has made progress on racial and social issues, and promised that he won't be the last black president.\n\n\"If, in fact, we continue to keep opportunity open to everybody, then, yes, we're going to have a woman president, we're going to have a Latino president, and we'll have a Jewish president, a Hindu president. Who knows who we're going to have? I suspect we'll have a whole bunch of mixed-up presidents at some point that nobody really knows what to call them,\" he said. \"And that's fine.\"\n\nObama said he's particularly proud of the \"transformation\" on gay rights during his presidency, which saw monumental Supreme Court decisions on gays in the military and same-sex marriage. Obama said his role was mostly to deliver \"a good block downfield to help the movement advance.\"\n\nHe said gay and lesbian activists deserve most of the credit, and singled out talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres, to whom he awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom last year.\n\n\"Somebody that kind and likable, projecting into living rooms around the country \u2014 that changed attitudes. That wasn't easy to do for her, And that's just one example of what was happening in countless communities around the country.\"\n\nOn other topics:\n\n\"It was important for us to send a signal, a wake-up call, that this moment may be passing, and Israeli voters and Palestinians need to understand that this moment may be passing,\" he said.\n\nObama blamed both a \"rightward drift in Israeli politics\" and the weakening position of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nBut he also acknowledged that President-elect Donald Trump has signaled a different direction. \"That's their prerogative. That's what happens after elections,\" he said. \"We'll see how their approach plays out.\"\n\nHe urged Trump not to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \"When sudden unilateral moves are made that speak to some of the core issues or sensitivities of either side, that can be explosive,\" he said. \"That's part of what we've tried to indicate to the incoming team. Pay attention to this. This is volatile stuff.\"\n\n\u25ba On Cuba: The two-year-old effort to normalize relations with Cuba led to the change in the \"wet foot-dry foot\" policy that favored Cuban refugees over other immigrants. Obama said the policy \"treated Cuban immigrants completely different from folks from El Salvador or Guatemala or Nicaragua or any other part of the world.\"\n\n\"You know, that was a carryover of a old way of thinking that didn't make sense in this day and age, particularly as we're opening up travel between the two countries,\" he said.\n\nObama ended his news conference by talking about his teenage daughters, Malia and Sasha. He said they were \"disappointed\" in the outcome of the election, but that \"they don't mope.\"\n\n\"I think neither of them intend to pursue a future of politics \u2014 and, in that, too, I think their mother's influence shows,\" he said.\n\n\"But both of them have grown up in an environment where I think they could not help but be patriotic, to love this country deeply, to see that it's flawed but see that they have responsibilities to fix it,\" he said. \"And I expect that's what they're going to do.\"\n\n\"So this is not just a matter of 'No Drama Obama.' This is what I really believe. It is true that behind closed doors I curse more than I do publicly. And sometimes I get mad and frustrated, like everybody else does. But at my core, I think we're going to be O.K.,\" he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.893997430801392, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 674, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.9241827716799997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.52225519287834, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/11/14/shift-airbnb-agrees-san-francisco-regs/93805068/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [2440]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 698, "scraper_regex": 942}}, "headline": "In shift, Airbnb agrees to San Francisco regs ", "wordcount_as_scraped": 942, "date": "20161114220000", "story_content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 After more than two years of tussling, Airbnb has given in to San Francisco's demands that it make sure its hosts conform to the city's 90-day cap on the number of nights a whole apartment or home can be rented per year.\n\nThe decision by the home-sharing site comes a week after a judge indicated he would likely rule against Airbnb in a lawsuit against San Francisco over the regulations.\n\nThe shift comes as cities worldwide struggle with a shortage of rental units, which critics say is exacerbated by units being taken off the rental market because they're more lucrative as short-term rentals. San Francisco-based Airbnb has facilitated thousands of such listings and fought back hard against attempts to regulate it.\n\nThis change in stance could be an example of Airbnb adapting to a changing environment, said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate at The Wharton School in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"This is an example of how Airbnb may have to be flexible in order to expand its market share. Its potential is extraordinary but in the end it's going to have to deal with local regulatory bodies. Regulation is inevitable,\" she said.\n\nAirbnb on Monday said it would craft a mandatory host registration system for the city and will provide San Francisco with a list of names, addresses and guest-stays for its hosts. Once the system is in place, the company agreed to cap listings of whole houses or apartments to 90 days per year, as required under a city regulation passed in 2015.\n\nIn an editorial in the San Francisco Chronicle, Airbnb admitted that it has made its share of mistakes along the way, but is making progress and now \"is ready and willing to do more to address the specific problems that remain,\" Chris Lehane wrote Monday.\n\nThe company also agreed to deal with an extremely hot-button issue in San Francisco: short-term rental of apartments whose tenants have been evicted under the state's Ellis Act, which allows landlords who want to get out of the business of renting to evict tenants. Those units then cannot legally be rented for five years.\n\n\"We're encouraged that Airbnb appears to be taking steps to meet their requirements under the law. We look forward to them coming into full compliance. San Francisco has a housing crisis on its hands, and we need to protect residents so their homes aren't illegally converted into de facto hotels,\" said John Cot\u00e9, communications director for the City Attorney.\n\nCritics have alleged that apartment emptied by landlords were being rented by the day on Airbnb. The company also said it would ensure that no Ellis Act'd apartments were rented to travelers.\n\nUnder current San Francisco rules, Airbnb hosts can rent individual rooms in their homes as many days a year as they want, while whole-house or apartment rentals are capped at 90 days.\n\nHowever, the city's Board of Supervisors, the local equivalent of the City Council, is considering even stronger regulations on short-term rentals, limiting them to just 60 days a year, down from the current 365.\n\nThe move came a week after U.S. District Judge James Donato made it seem likely he'd find for San Francisco in a suit filed by Airbnb that claimed the site wasn't responsible for its users who didn't follow local regulations and that it was protected under free speech rules because it was simply the publisher of the listings.\n\nDonato denied a request for a preliminary injunction by Airbnb last week, indicating he found merit in San Francisco's arguments that it has the right to regulate the service.\n\nAirbnb had launched multiple suits against municipalities that want to regulate its hosts, including San Francisco, Anaheim and Santa Monica, Calif, Chicago and the state of New York.\n\nThe fact that Airbnb has backed down with San Francisco could embolden other cities to increase their efforts to regulate the short-term rental site and also seems to indicate a change of course in the company's response to such suits.\n\n\"Airbnb's mantra seems to have been, 'We're the new kid on the block, we represent a new paradigm in occupancy and it's not us that need to confirm to statues, it's the municipalities and the states that need to conform to us,'\" said Sherwin Belkin, a real estate lawyer with Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman who represents owners, managers and developers in New York City.\n\nNew York state passed a law Oct. 21 which allows hosts to be fined up to $7,500 for listings rooms that are not legal for short-term rentals.\n\nThat same day, Airbnb filed suit against New York, saying under the Communications Decency Act of 1996, the company can't be held liable for content such as rental listings created by third-parties. The suit also argued that the New York law is a violation of the First Amendment rights of both Airbnb and its users. Airbnb has filed similar lawsuits in Anaheim and Santa Monica.\n\nThe fact that Airbnb appears to now be willing to find a way to work things out in San Francisco represents a shift in strategy, Belkin said.\n\n\"It's a big tonal change.\"\n\nIn the end, whatever happens in San Francisco and New York tends to diffuse across the country, but as least some regulations could end up being to Airbnb's advantage, said Hart Posen, a professor in the business school at the University of Wisconsin.\n\n\"You need a certain degree of scale to manage that kind of regulations, and that's a barrier to new companies coming into the field. Once [Airbnb] builds the software to do it, it's usable in San Francisco and Chicago and everywhere else\" he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.3351135253906201, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 698, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.75690016435, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.29512893982808, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/19/trump-inauguration-protests-democrats-jonathan-turley-column/96669492/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Trump is our president: Jonathan Turley", "wordcount_as_scraped": 970, "date": "20170119130000", "story_content": "It is inaugural week and Washington is again the rallying point for hundreds of thousands of people. Indeed, my house in McLean, Virginia is hosting roughly a dozen people from Illinois and Florida. They are not, however, coming to celebrate but to protest. My brother Chris, his family, and various friends will be joining thousands protesting the inauguration and then will join the \"Women's March.\" I will not be joining them. While I fully support their exercise of free speech and share some of their concerns, I believe that this week is about celebrating the 71st time that a democratically elected president has taken the oath of office (and our 58th formal inauguration). I was highly critical of both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during the campaign. However, there is a time to protest and there is a time to come together, even if only for an inaugural ceremony.\n\nOver 50 Democratic members of Congress have publicly announced that they will not attend the inauguration, including some like Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who has insisted that Trump is not the legitimate president. (Lewis and other members also boycotted George W. Bush's inauguration in 2001 because they insisted that he was not the true elected president.) Ironically, many of these members were the same people joining Hillary Clinton in denouncing the \"horrifying\" notion that Trump or his supporters might not accept the results of the election. Clinton decried how Trump, by not stating that he would accept the results of losing, he was \"denigrating \u2014 he is talking down our democracy.\" That was when Clinton was viewed as a shoe-in. Then came election night.\n\nAfter the election, Clinton joined others in challenging results in key states and Democrats began to question the legitimacy of the election \u2014 first due to the fact that Trump lost the popular vote and later based on Russian hacking of Democratic emails.\n\nIt is of course immaterial that Trump lost the popular vote in a system based on electoral, not popular voting. (For the record, I have long been a critic of the Electoral College.) Moreover, while references to the \"Russian hacking of the election\" have become common shorthand, the Russians did not hack the election. Emails were hacked and those emails were not faked or tampered with, as repeatedly claimed by DNC chair Donna Brazile. As recently confirmed by the intelligence report, they were real emails showing incredibly dishonest and corrupt practices. Although there is no question that the leak appears selective in targeting Democrats, Washington seems most aggrieved by the fact that the public was given a true insight into the false and duplicitous behavior that defines the establishment. However, according to a new CNN/ORC poll, the spin is not taking: almost 60% of voters do not believe the hacking determined the outcome of the election.\n\nIn the end, the protests are not about legitimacy. Trump is by any measure our duly elected and legitimate president. It is about a refusal to accept legitimate results. Even the title of \"The Women's March\" is dubious.\n\nWhile Bill Clinton insisted that his wife lost because Trump figured out \"how to get angry, white men to vote for him,\" the fact is that it was the Democratic leadership that secured the election for Trump. Despite long-standing polls showing that voters did not want an establishment figure, the establishment pre-selected Clinton, who is not only one of the most recognized establishment figures but someone carrying more luggage than Greyhound. She is also someone who had even higher negative polling on character and truthfulness than Trump.\n\nMore importantly, it is a well-maintained myth that Clinton was the candidate of women who overwhelmingly rejected Trump. Clinton pulled basically the same percentage of female votes as Obama did four years earlier. Indeed, Clinton actually did slightly worse this election than Obama did in the prior two presidential elections with women. She received just 54% of women's votes while Obama received 55% against Romney and 56% against McCain. Trump handily beat Clinton among many groups of women. For example, 62% of white women without college degrees voted for him over Clinton. Even among college-educated women, Clinton only won 51%. She lost the votes of white women by a whooping 52-43% against Trump. It was her margin among black female voters (over 90%) that eked out an overall majority of women.\n\nMoreover, Trump won basically the same percentage of white voters as Romney. Indeed, according to Pew Research, the percentage was virtually identical with Trump beating Clinton by 21 points and Romney beating Obama by 20 points. Clinton actually fell in the percentage of black voters. Trump outperformed Romney among black, Hispanic, and Asian voters. For example, despite all of the coverage of Trump's illegal immigration comments, he received roughly 30% of all Hispanic votes.\n\nThe point is not to belittle the basis or numbers of opponents to Trump. Yet, there is an effort to establish a mythology that Trump was elected by white men and heavily opposed by women. Worse yet, there is an effort to portray him as some presidential pretender to the office. In reality, it is Democratic leaders who have abandoned tradition and denigrated our democracy by refusing to stand with the new president at his inauguration. Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., said she would not attend because she did not want to \"contribute to the normalization of the President-elect's divisive rhetoric by participating in the inauguration.\" That \"normalization\" is called the democratic process. We are celebrating not a particular victor but the fact that there was a victor \u2014 a democratically elected victor followed by a peaceful transition of power.\n\nSo, I will not be with my brother and friends at the protests. I will be home toasting the 71st oath of office . . . and, yes, the 45th president of the United States.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.64075994491577, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1018, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.6998622554400002, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170119130000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.45579567779961, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/11/04/cyber-threats-election-2016-russia-clinton-trump-ukraine-hack-ddos-dyn-denial-of-service-attack/93249646/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "'Getting twitchy': election threats have cyber experts worried", "wordcount_as_scraped": 829, "date": "20161104210000", "story_content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 The drumbeat of potential election cyber-catastrophe has been pounding for months now.

The election comes close on the heels of a massive attack two weeks ago against Dyn, a New Hampshire-based company that routes Internet traffic, that kept users on the East coast from accessing popular sites for hours.\n\n\"If you can make us question one district in any of the battleground states, especially with Trump's rhetoric calling the election rigged, that will certainly go a long way towards causing chaos and disruption,\" said Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at Crowdstrike, the computer security company that identified Russians as behind the hack of the DNC in June.\n\n\"These things are what we're really getting twitchy about,\" he said.\n\nAfter weeks of hints, last month the U.S. intelligence community blamed Russia for hacking into and leaking sensitive documents from the Democratic National Committee. It's a charge Russian president Vladimir Putin has denied but one many computer experts are convinced is true.\n\nOnly this week Microsoft announced it was issuing a patch to address vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system that were exploited by a group that's been tied to the Russian government and linked to the DNC hack.\n\nFears of a cyber attack on the election process stem both from that link and from parallels with reported Russian cyber involvement in national elections in Ukraine, say computer security experts.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to make voters question the validity of the results of the election, said Crowdstrike's Meyers.\n\n\"We've been comparing what we're seeing today to what happened in Ukraine over the last two years. The individuals are certainly using the same playbook,\" he said.\n\nIn 2015, computers of Ukraine's national election commission were hit with a major attack that deleted backups, damaged hard drives, make software unusable and changed routers settings. The attack was linked to a pro-Moscow group called CyberBerkut, according to the Wall Street Journal. The attack came three days before national elections.\n\nOn the day of the election, May 25, 2015, hackers hit the election commission's website with a distributed denial of service attack in an attempt to knock it offline that ultimately failed. Hoax charts appeared online showing that a far-right candidate was winning when he was not. Russian state news programs showed the chart on air \u2014 despite the fact that it hadn't yet been released publicly.\n\nAll of this has computer security experts on edge. For the first time they are saying outright that a large, well-resourced organization backed by a country the United States has been jousting with for years now appears to be attempting to influence the presidential election.\n\n\"I think I'm rationally paranoid about this. It's pretty clear to me that Putin is trying to help Trump. I don't think there's any question about it,\" said Stanford's Lin.\n\nThe concerns have been amplified by comments from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has alleged multiple times that the election has been \"rigged.\" He famously called upon Russia to hack into Democratic nominee Clinton's emails in July, though he later said he was only being sarcastic.\n\nElection experts caution that actual votes are safe. The U.S. electoral system is far too decentralized and offline for enough votes to be influenced to truly impact the outcome of the election or even the outcome of a single district.\n\nPost-election auditing systems, mostly paper-based and therefore not so subject to cyberattack, are widely in use across the United States, said Pamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, a non-partisan, non-profit organization that advocates for elections accuracy.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's the votes that are captured and recorded that decide,\" she said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.9784946441650404, "HarmVice": 10, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 798, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.20546672953, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161104210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.63408521303258, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/11/16/reince-priebus-wisconsin-white-house/93993726/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1373, "scraper_regex": 1274}}, "headline": "Priebus: How a true believer made it from Wisconsin to the White House", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1274, "date": "20161117060000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Until last week, Reince Priebus had one burning regret as the GOP's longest-serving chairman.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we've become a party that can't lose a midterm and can't win a presidential,\" he said in a 2014 interview. \"I'm here to try to fix that.\"\n\nThe election of Donald Trump not only fixed that, it brought Priebus to the pinnacle of power in Washington.\n\nWhen Trump named him White House chief of staff Sunday, it capped a breathtaking climb for the onetime student body president at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.\n\nThe new power broker at the heart of the Trump White House is a sociable lawyer and litigator who savors politics and can enjoy sharing a beer with a Democrat.\n\nHe's a data-driven manager who sometimes lapses into the language of marketing and metrics when he talks about \"growing\" the Republican Party.\n\nBut Priebus is also an \"insider\" with an ideology.\n\nHe is a born-and-bred conservative who grew up idolizing Ronald Reagan and whose mantra is, \"Win every day, live the mission every day, wait on God's timing and good things happen.\"\n\nAs the early turbulence of the Trump transition suggests, Priebus faces immense challenges in his new job: a president with no government experience; competing White House factions; a party riven in the recent primaries; and the urgent need to adapt the skills of a party operative and fundraiser to the task of keeping a presidency on track.\n\nHis approach to decision-making is that \"he talks to lots of people, he doesn't do it by himself. He's very inclusive, very collaborative. Once there is a plan in place, he becomes laser-focused on executing (it),\" said Jeff Larson, who worked for Priebus at the Republican National Committee and managed the 2016 GOP convention.\n\nBecause of the controversy around parts of the Trump team, some inside and outside the party have invested their hopes in Priebus as a stabilizing force.\n\n\"America has no idea what we're going to get from Donald Trump as president,\" said Mike Tate, who chaired the Wisconsin Democratic Party when Priebus was the state Republican chair. Tate said he took the Priebus appointment as a positive, saying he has a \"moral center.\"\n\n\"Reince is a bridge builder and I think he will help President Trump bring people together. We need the country to heal,\" said Henry Barbour, an RNC member from Mississippi.\n\nPriebus, 44, grew up in Kenosha County, Wis., historically Democratic blue-collar turf that went Republican this year for the first time since 1972.\n\nHis father was a pro-military, pro-Reagan union electrician. (Reince is short for Reinhold, reflecting his father's German heritage).\n\nHis mother, born in the Greek community in Khartoum in the Sudan, met her husband, a Wisconsin native, while he served in the U.S. Army in Ethiopia.\n\n\"I can remember in third grade having mock elections, and being the campaign chairman for Ronald Reagan,\" said Priebus.\n\nWhen Priebus ran in 2011 to be leader of the Republican National Committee, he told RNC members that \"our chairman has to be an outspoken, unabashed conservative.\" He promised to \"work like an absolute dog.\"\n\nWhen the five candidates for chair were asked how many guns they have at home, he said five. (Another candidate said 16).\n\nAsked who his hero was besides Reagan, he said, \"Lincoln.\"\n\nAsked where he gets his news, he included the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and the op-ed pages of the Wall Street Journal.\n\nPriebus, who promised to be a \"no drama\" chairman, won on the seventh ballot. Among those he defeated was the sitting chair, Michael Steele, whom he once advised and supported but who was dogged by controversy and left the RNC more than $20 million in debt.\n\n\"I am so blessed,\" he told the Republicans after the vote.\n\n\"My first date with my wife (Sally) was a Lincoln Day dinner with (GOP congressmen) Henry Hyde and Jim Sensenbrenner, which will tell you a little something about me,\" he said.\n\n\"He is not a stick-in-the-mud conservative,\" his close friend, House Speaker Paul Ryan, said of him back in 2009. \"He's a younger conservative who believes in expanding the base.\"\n\n\"Afterwards, we sat down and we talked about it. He's like, 'Should I run again in four years, or should I be more involved in the political party?'\" said Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a close friend since college. \"And he kind of came to the conclusion that he loved the political side as much as the policy side.\"\n\nPriebus rose from county chair to district chair to Wisconsin GOP chair in 2007, before enduring the Republican nightmare of the 2008 Obama landslide, when Arizona Sen. John McCain lost the state by 14 points.\n\nHe jokingly complained the election was called so quickly that reporters phoned him for comment one minute after the polls closed.\n\n\"Can you at least let me have one beer?\" he pleaded.\n\nIn the GOP wave of 2010, his party enjoyed its best Wisconsin election since the 1930s, gaining the governor's office, the Legislature, a U.S. Senate and House seat.\n\nPriebus became a fundraising workhorse at the RNC, eager to spend the money on better data, technology, turnout models and year-round community organizing.\n\nIn an interview, he complained \"our party has divorced itself from American culture.\" He said it had become a \"U-Haul trailer of cash for a nominee that buys 30 second ads\" \u2014 a model \"we're trying to blow out the door.\"\n\nRNC member Barbour said Priebus \"made a big bet on organization. We spent about five times more on data and digital .... He did the hard work before the (2016) election.\"\n\nHis Wisconsin roots and relationships left a stamp.\n\nIn college, Priebus was roommates with Vos and Andy Speth, who became Paul Ryan's chief of staff. They and their friends were dubbed the \"Whitewater Mafia.\"\n\n\"Reince was a mini-me of exactly who he is today\" \u2014 deeply driven, with an abiding interest in politics, said Vos.\n\nLater, he was part of the Cheesehead Revolution, a label for the rising Wisconsin trio of Priebus, Gov. Scott Walker and Ryan, the party's 2012 vice presidential nominee.\n\nThe Republican model in Wisconsin was about audacious conservative policy-making, unleashing massive GOP turnouts and \"playing well in the sandbox\" (as Priebus put it) with tea party activists and grass-roots conservatives.\n\n\"People are asking what's in the water in Wisconsin?\" he told a group of home-state Republicans in 2012. \"The better question would be, what's in the beer in Wisconsin?\"\n\nTrump's rise this year threatened to derail Wisconsin's GOP stars. The New York developer drove Walker from the presidential race, sparred frequently with Ryan, and undermined the Latino outreach that Priebus espoused.\n\nThe RNC chair took flak from Trump's GOP critics for not trying to stop his nomination. His defenders said he did what a party chairman had to do and let the voters decide.\n\n\"All the carping about jettisoning the Trump campaign \u2014 he never, ever, ever thought of (doing) that,\" said Larson.\n\n\"All throughout this time, when people were doubting Donald Trump, not a single time that he and I talked in person, or talked on the phone, or texted, did he ever say a negative thing about Donald Trump. He was always loyal, because he's the nominee,\" said Vos.\n\nTrump's victory not only elevated Priebus, but cemented his friend Ryan's hold on the speakership.\n\nFrictions aside, Trump and the GOP Congress need each other, said GOP Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.\n\nPriebus \"obviously has got Trump's confidence, and he is the bridge (with) Republican senators and representatives,\" said Sensenbrenner. \"You could accuse Reince of facilitating an arranged marriage, but hopefully this arranged marriage is going to work out.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 23, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.326583921909332, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1373, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.58447962263, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 23, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161117060000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.3306627822287003, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/17/scotland-brexit-speech-reaction/96678328/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 684, "scraper_regex": 641}}, "headline": "Britain's break with EU could drive Scotland to another vote", "wordcount_as_scraped": 641, "date": "20170117220000", "story_content": "GLASGOW, Scotland \u2014 The British prime minister's plans for exiting the European Union have increased the likelihood of a second Scottish independence referendum, the country's first minister and the leader of the Scottish National Party said Tuesday.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the 12-point outline that UK Prime Minister Theresa May unveiled for the British EU exit, which some call a hard Brexit, \"economically catastrophic.\"\n\n\"Decisions are being driven not by the rational best interests of the country, but by the obsessions of the hard right of the Tory party,\" Sturgeon said. May has been leader of the Conservative Party, also known as the Tories, since July.\n\nA hard Brexit, in which the United Kingdom would end its membership in the European Union's single market to gain greater control over immigration, is not in Scotland's best interests because of its effect on trade, Sturgeon said.\n\nIn her first detailed speech on the UK's Brexit objectives, May confirmed that the United Kingdom also might leave the customs union of common tariffs across the continent. She stressed that Britain wants to maximize trade with the European Union but also to be free to strike its own deals with the rest of the world.\n\nThe Scottish Greens, whose votes would give Sturgeon the majority she needs for another referendum in Scotland, said May's speech make a second independence vote unavoidable.\n\nLast month, Sturgeon published a detailed proposal that would allow Scotland to stay as an EU trading partner, predicated on the United Kingdom sacrificing some of its demands in negotiations with the other 27 EU nations to arrange a side deal for Scotland. However, May's speech with its repeated references to unity suggested a special arrangement for Scotland was unlikely.\n\n\"Our guiding principle must be to ensure that \u2014 as we leave the European Union \u2014 no new barriers to living and doing business within our own union are created,\" May said.\n\nThe prime minister's hint that Britain could rewrite its economic model to become a \"low wage, low tax, de-regulated economy\" would mean a race to the bottom for workers, leaving everyone but the very wealthiest worse off, Sturgeon said.\n\n\"It seems the Westminster Tory government now think they can do anything to Scotland and get away with it,\" Sturgeon said. \"They must start to understand how wrong they are.\"\n\nRoss Greer of the Scottish Green Party, a Scottish Parliament minister for West Scotland, called May's speech \"confused, contradictory and dangerous\" and wanted the Scottish Parliament to have a vote on the final agreement.\n\n\"The angry, isolated Britain the Tories clearly have in mind isn't something I believe most people here want to be a part of,\" Greer said.\n\nHowever, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said May's clear and reasonable statement left Scottish nationalists no justification for a second referendum.\n\nScottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale echoed Sturgeon, saying May's speech had been designed to appease the right wing rather than help the nation. But she considers a second independence referendum a mistake.\n\n\"We were promised an outward-looking vision of a reformed nation, but instead we got a plan for a more insular nation,\" Dugdale said. \"This isn't what many Leave supporters voted for,\" but she considers remaining in the United Kingdom more important to Scotland than being a part of the European Union.\n\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats Party leader, Willie Rennie, said Britain's Conservative Party members were \"hell bent on a hard Brexit,\" regardless of its effect on millions of people, higher prices and greater instability.\n\n\"Withdrawing from the single market and the customs union is not in our country's interest nor was it what people voted for on the 23rd June,\" Rennie said. \"This speech shows how vital it is that the public be given a say in a Brexit deal referendum.\"\n\nScottish and United Kingdom ministers are to meet Thursday to discuss Brexit plans.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.397350996732712, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 684, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.09191906725, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6549707602339203, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/17/china-xi-jingping-davos-world-economic-forum/96658058/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 533, "scraper_regex": 499}}, "headline": "Davos: China's Xi invokes Gettysburg Address in defense of free trade", "wordcount_as_scraped": 499, "date": "20170117140000", "story_content": "DAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a forceful argument Tuesday for globalization and pushed back against talk of protectionism that was a hallmark of President-elect Donald Trump's economic policy during his campaign.\n\n\"No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war,\" he said in a speech at the World Economic Forum before a crowd of 1,250 global leaders and CEOs.\n\n\"Some people blame economic globalization for what has gone wrong in our world,\" Xi said. \"It is true that economic globalization has created new problems, but this is no justification to write off economic globalization all together.\"\n\nXi's attendance at the annual gathering for business leaders and the international elite comes as China has sought to present itself as a force for stability after Trump's election and the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union. Both of those events were perceived as victories for anti-establishment forces. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on some foreign-made goods and sanction China for manipulating its currency.\n\nXi, the first Chinese head of state to visit the forum, did not mention Trump by name, but he addressed many of the trade and economic issues that Trump raised during his presidential campaign.\n\n\"Say no to protectionism,\" Xi said. \"It is like locking yourself in a dark room. Wind and rain are kept out, but so are light and air.\"\n\nXi said China would keep its door \"wide open\" to free trade and would not start a trade war by devaluing its currency.

A state-taxed marijuana marketplace in California could generate $1 billion in taxes, experts say. That's money that today vanishes into the pockets of black marketers and smugglers. Polls show the measure with significant public support.\n\n\"I really believe California really is a watershed moment for this industry,\" said Adam Bierman, the co-founder of the national cannabis firm MedMen. The company offers consulting and management services to the marijuana industry, and Bierman oversees the MedMen Opportunity Fund, a $100 million private equity fund focused on cannabis ventures.\n\nNationally, legal pot initiatives could spell a three-fold expansion in legal cannabis in the U.S.\n\nThe marijuana industry is expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 29% over the next four years, said Giada DeCarcer, the founder and CEO of cannabis-focused analysis firm New Frontier Data.\n\nDespite this outlook, the amount of venture capital investment in marijuana remains low compared to industries that traditionally receive this kind of growth financing. The second quarter of 2015 was the biggest ever. Even then, only about $150 million in capital was invested in marijuana-linked companies, according to PitchBook Data. A year later, investments for the same quarter sank to $54 million, the financial analysis firm said. About $776 million in capital has been invested into the industry since the start of 2016, according to Viridian Capital Advisors.\n\nIn comparison, overall venture capital investment hit nearly $20 billion in the second quarter of 2015, rising to $22.1 billion in the second quarter of this year. Legal pot's slight investment draw was dwarfed by more traditional industries, such as software.\n\nBut the potential is obvious: a new study by Colorado economists found that marijuana legalization created 18,005 new jobs in 2015, and netted $996 million in sales and $121 million in taxes, with an overall $2.4 billion economic impact for Colorado alone.\n\nNumbers like these have piqued interest. \"We are already seeing an enormous amount of interest from investors and entrepreneurs who recognize the unique scale of the opportunity presented by cannabis legalization,\" said Troy Dayton, the Arcview Group's CEO. Oakland, Calif.-based Arcview is an investment network that has made $84 million in marijuana-related investments since 2013.\n\nHelping spur earlier investments: Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, which in 2015 made a multimillion-dollar investment in Privateer Holdings, the world's first private equity firm investing exclusively in the legal cannabis market. Seattle-based Privateer owns Leafly, a Yelp-like app and website service that works much like a marijuana search engine to connect medical and recreational users with legal suppliers, along with strain reviews. Privateer also backs the Marley Natural marijuana line, founded with the surviving family of reggae star Bob Marley, and Tilray, a Canada-based medical marijuana company.\n\nAlso boosting interest: the 2013 announcement by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta that he believed marijuana has the potential to help sick people. Residents of 25 states already have access to some form of medical marijuana, which users say can help combat nausea from chemotherapy, reduce seizures and potentially replace highly addictive prescription painkillers.\n\nYet few large-scale investors have shown themselves willing to risk large amounts of capital in marijuana, restrained by the substance's uneven legal status nationally.\n\nIn many cases, the chartering language of large institutional and venture capital firms prohibits them from directly participating in anything illegal or immoral. There's a ban on transport across state lines. Regardless of how California votes next month, marijuana remains illegal at the federal level \u2014 a fact that translates into \"reputational risk\" for investors.\n\nAdditionally, it's virtually impossible for people operating in the marijuana space to get bank accounts. In Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, marijuana-store owners are forced to conduct their transactions in cash, including paying their taxes.\n\n\"Banks aren't going to touch this unless there is clear guidance from the feds that they aren't going to prosecute, and they want it in writing, which is something the federal government has not been willing to do yet,\" said John Kagia, New Frontier's executive vice president of industry analytics. \"So as a result, you end up with $7.5 billion industry that is still largely being done in cash. It's not sustainable. It leads to enormous security concerns \u2026 and operational inefficiencies.\"\n\nThere's at least a partial answer to these legal grey areas: real estate.\n\nInvestors reluctant to \"touch\" marijuana directly are rapidly expanding their property portfolios. Earlier this month, a San Diego-based real estate investment trust announced plans to raise $175 million with an IPO that would fund the purchase of marijuana grow facilities across the country.\n\nReal estate, said Bierman and Scott Greiper of Viridian Capital Advisors, a cannabis-focused investment and advisory firm, is a foothold opportunity for those investors looking for a business model they're comfortable with.\n\n\"There's a lot of people who wouldn't touch any of the 'sin' verticals,\" Greiper said.\n\nOver time, California's vote may change that. The state's voters are widely expected to endorse legalization, which will help persuade more large-scale investors to dip their toes into the marketplace. Among those who have backed the legalization effort with cash include former Facebook president Sean Parker, who has put up more than $8.5 million, and Weedmaps, a social network and Yelp-like referral service for marijuana, which has donated more than $1 million.\n\nA study released last month by New Frontier and Arcview Market Research found that nearly 70% of high-net-worth investors belonging to Arcview's investment group, and who are interested in the marijuana industry as a whole, are now willing to consider investing in businesses that either directly touch marijuana or provide ancillary services, such as real estate, although investment trends have yet to bear that out.\n\nThe Arcview/New Frontier survey found that investors have made the bulk of their investments since 2014, when Colorado and Oregon legalized recreational marijuana, and 71% of investors expected to put more into cannabis in 2016 than they did in 2015. The increasing pace of investment is hard to ignore, even if the numbers are still relatively small.\n\n\"Whether you like it or don't like it \u2026 it is what it is. This is what's happening,\" Bierman said. \"The fact remains: It is inevitable and it is happening before our very eyes.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.2106537818908703, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1098, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.22898303622, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "usatoday.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161102130000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 9, "pct_mft_words": 3.4608378870673997, "C_SOURCE": 1}}}
